            "human_gen_truncate": ", the number of teachers flagged statewide in Dallas for having sex and other inappropriate relationships with students continues to rise, according to the Texas Education Agency (TEA). In 2018, the TEA opened 429 cases into inappropriate student-educator relationships, an alarming approximate 42% increase from the prior year. Thus, it can be argued that excessive competition encourages corrupt means to do well. Students will turn to wrong and immoral methods to stay on top of the competition. Additionally, placing high stakes in examinations not only results in excessive competition, it also leads to stress. Sometimes, the pressure may be too much to handle. In Singapore, we are no strangers to the huge amounts of academic stress that can overwhelm students. Singapore had a tragic wake-up call when an 11-year-old boy fell 17 floors from his bedroom window in a deliberate act of suicide. This was because he was fearful of revealing his poor grades to his parents. Moreover, more teenagers from top schools in Singapore are reportedly seeking help at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for school-related stress. This serves as a unfortunate example illustrating how a \"pressure-cooker\" education system with far too much competition can actually overly stress students out and ruin their psychological wellbeing or even cause them to take their precious lives.\nHowever, it must also be acknowledged that not all education systems in the world require competition to function well. For example, in Finland, high-stakes standardized tests are literally a completely foreign concept. These students take only a few tests yearly, and when they do, they are mostly low-stakes. However, the quality of teaching has made Finnish students consistently near the top when it comes to international education rankings including the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Therefore, while students are not pressurized to compete in high-stakes examinations like the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATs), they manage to perform very well because the Finnish education system focuses more on consistently learning and improving rather than one-shot measurements and ranking of student'scapabilities. This serves as proof that competition may not be necessary in the initial, pre-university stages as younger children may require more positive reinforcement to be motivated to keep learning.\nThere is more than one way to a destination. Competition can be a method to prevent complacency and laziness in students, and to serve as motivation for students to constantly better themselves. However, constant checks and reviews are definitely needed to ensure that competition does not breed corruption and underhand methods of succeeding. In addition, competition may not be necessary in every single aspect of learning as that may result in an overly stressful learning process. Instead, perhaps competition can come in at a later age, where students will be mature enough to cope with stress and the occasional defeat, which will make competition effective in shaping the character of students.

When competition becomes the sole focus of education, it can lead to increased stress and anxiety levels among students. Excessive pressure to perform well can lead to burnout, depression, and other mental health issues. Furthermore, it can lead to a negative self-image and a lack of confidence in one's abilities.\n\nIn addition, competition can foster a culture of individualism, which can be detrimental in the long run. When students work hard to outshine their peers, they may prioritize their own success over the needs of others. This can lead to a lack of empathy, cooperation and teamwork skills, which are also critical in today's work environment.\n\nMoreover, competition can demotivate students who do not perform well in competitive environments. Students who do not achieve the top positions can become disengaged from learning and lose interest in the subject matter. This can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and failure.\n\nIn conclusion, competition in education can be effective when it is balanced and used appropriately. While it can motivate students and promote important social skills, it can also lead to stress and a negative self-image. Educators and policymakers should strive for a collaborative learning environment that fosters teamwork skills, empathy and cooperation while still providing motivation for students to excel. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of educators and policymakers to determine what approach best fits the needs of their students and the goals of their educational programs.",

                ", South Korea is also infamous for the high rate of suicide among students due to the heavy pressure of competition in their country's education system. This clearly shows that excess competition can lead to students becoming stressed, burnt-out and in extreme cases of depression, even suicidal. Thus, while competition is important in education, the extent of it should not cross the line and become detrimental to students' health and wellbeing.\nIn conclusion, competition in the education system is important as it drives students to strive for excellence and achieve their potentials. Nevertheless, educators and administrators should ensure that competition does not become overly excessive or unhealthy for students. The primary purpose of education is not just to produce exceptionally intelligent individuals but also people of character who will contribute positively to society. Schools should constantly seek to strike a balance between encouraging competition among students and maintaining their holistic well-being. By doing so, we can create a more fulfilling education system that brings out the best in our students.",
                ", countries like South Korea and Japan have also experienced incidences of students suffering from stress and even taking their own lives due to the pressure of performing well academically. This highlights the potential harmful effects of excessive competition in schools. Additionally, competition can also create a sense of hostility and animosity among students, moving the focus from personal growth onto outdoing their peers. This defeats the purpose of education and can also undermine one'sability to work collaboratively, an important skill in many workplaces.\nTo mitigate the adverse effects of competition in schools, a few measures can be taken. Firstly, schools can implement a system where students can be rewarded for improvement across a wide range of subjects instead of the usual emphasis on academic results. Such a system motivates students to work on developing well-rounded skillsets and prevents them from neglecting subjects that they may not be as proficient in. Additionally, the emphasis on individual improvement, rather than outdoing their peers, will help students focus more on their personal development rather than being overly concerned with how they fare in comparison to others. Schools can also invest in providing students with adequate professional counselling services and mental health support, especially in highly competitive systems. This would ensure that students have a safe space to talk about their fears and anxieties without feeling judged or stigmatized.\nIn conclusion, while competition in schools can be a double-edged sword, it is an essential component in motivating and developing students. However, excessive competition can be detrimental to students' wellbeing and can also potentially defeat the purpose of education by leading to unhealthy rivalry and hostility. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the education system strikes a balance between competition and personal growth, and also to ensure that students receive adequate support to handle the pressures of a competitive environment.",
                ", highly competitive education systems like South Korea and Japan are known for their high suicide rates due to the immense pressure students face to perform well in the education system. Thus, too much competition in schools can cause students to develop depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues which can potentially ruin their lives.\nFurthermore, competition can lead to students becoming overly selfish. Instead of working together to achieve success, students may have the mindset of \"everyone for themselves\" as they try to outdo each other. This can result in an unhealthy learning environment where students are not able to help each other grow. Moreover, the focus on competition can also lead to an unbalanced education system where subjects that are not tested in exams, like the arts, are often neglected in favor of subjects that are seen as more \"important\" due to their examinable nature.\nIn conclusion, competition is important as it can bring about healthy growth and improvement in students. However, when competition becomes excessive, it can lead to negative consequences for students' mental and emotional well-being. Therefore, while competition should be a part of the education system, it must be balanced with the promotion of teamwork, the encouragement of improving oneself, and a focus on developing individuals of character along with intelligence. Only then can the true goal of education, which is to nurture individuals with both intelligence and character, be achieved.",
                ", another similar example is the high suicide rate in South Korea among students due to academic pressures. It is not uncommon for students to attend tuition classes until late at night, sometimes even until the early hours of the morning in order to better their grades. This kind of intense pressure can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression, which can have a negative impact on the student'sgrowth and development. This ultimately contradicts the true purpose of education, which is to develop intelligent and well-rounded individuals with strong character traits. Therefore, while competition and ranking have their benefits, excessive competition can lead to negative consequences that must be carefully monitored.\nIn conclusion, intelligence and character are the true goals of education. While competition can raise the quality of education and provide a clear goal for students to strive towards, safeguards must be put in place to ensure that competition in the education system remains reasonable and healthy for the student'sgrowth and development. Education must strike a balance between being motivating and constructive while promoting personal development and not sacrificing the student'smental and emotional well-being. Ultimately, if competition is managed well in the education system, it can help shape students into individuals with strong character and a well-rounded education that will serve them well in their future endeavors.",
                ", South Korea is also a country where an excessive education obsession has led to negative consequences, with students facing depression, high suicide rates and social withdrawal resulting from the pressure to excel in their studies. In fact, many experts believe that excessive competition in education is a culprit in causing a decline in the overall mental health of students, leading to the onset of depression and other mental health concerns. Therefore, unchecked competition in education can truly be detrimental to the mental and physical well-being of students, and thus it is necessary to implement safeguards against such occurrences.\n\nIn conclusion, competition is vital in molding individuals of character, but too much of it can have negative impacts. Encouraging competition with oneself is an excellent way of promoting personal growth and improvement, while excessive competition can lead to negative consequences in both mental and physical health. Therefore, educators must strive towards striking a balance in order to provide students with an education that is not only effective, but also conducive to building a well-rounded individual. Ultimately, education is not only about acquiring knowledge, but also about forming one's character and developing skills that contribute to making the world a better place.",
                ", it is also not uncommon to hear about students who have developed mental health issues due to the constant pressure to perform in school- this can include anxiety, depression and even suicidal thoughts.\nMoreover, excessive competition can also result in negative social effects that can be harmful to the development of students. Students in overly competitive environments are more prone to placing winning above everything else, which can result in them becoming less cooperative and more individualistic. This undermines teamwork and can result in a more toxic school atmosphere where cheating and cut-throat behaviour is normalized.\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt that competition is necessary in education to a certain extent- it is important in facilitating personal growth, promoting perseverance, and encouraging a desire for excellence. However, it is also important that we recognize the dangers of excessive competition and take steps to avoid it. Educators and policymakers should work to strike a balance between competition and cooperation, encouraging students to work together to achieve academic success, while recognizing the importance of personal growth and well-being. Ultimately, education should be about developing students of intelligence and character, and we should always strive to ensure that competition in schools does not detract from this goal.",
                ", in South Korea, there have been cases of student suicide due to immense stress caused by the rigorous education system. This indicates that competition can go too far, leading to the loss of moral compass and even worse outcomes like death. Furthermore, excessive competition leads to students' obsession with results, as opposed to developing one'scharacter. Many students' priorities and values get skewed and being the \"best\" takes centre stage, as opposed to learning and personal growth.\nTo conclude, while competition is important in education, it should be held in moderation and not taken to the extreme. Competition should not negatively impact a student'svalues and life, leading to unethical and immoral actions. Schools should provide a healthy balance between competition and the development of one's character to ensure that students not only excel academically but also grow into respectable and compassionate adults who add value to society. As educators, we must understand that true progress can only be achieved when intellect and character are both developed in a student.",
                ", South Korea is notorious for its \"exam hell\" culture where children as young as 10 to 12 years old go to intense tutorial centres known as hagwons, study till midnight and have very little social life, and it's all just to score good grades. Such environments create immense pressure and anxiety in students, sometimes leading to dire consequences such as depression, anxiety disorders, and even suicide. It is clear that in such situations, students lose sight of the true goal of education - which is to nurture well-rounded individuals with sound moral and ethical characters.\nIn conclusion, the role of competition in education is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it motivates and pushes students to strive and improve, but on the other hand, excessive competition can be extremely counterproductive and harmful to students' physical and mental health. I believe that competition should be moderated and balanced, so that students still have a sense of purpose and motivation, but not to the extent that they are willing to resort to less than honourable means to achieve success. If we can find the right balance, education will remain meaningful, and students will continue to grow into individuals who possess a strong sense of resilience and character.",
                ", many countries like South Korea and China have also faced issues like high levels of student stress, mental health problems and even suicide due to excessive competition in schools. Therefore, it is important to recognize that excessive competition can be unhealthy and detrimental to one's physical, mental and emotional well-being and should be curbed.\nIn conclusion, competition in education is necessary to encourage personal growth, self-improvement, and to bring out the best in students. However, it is important to ensure that competition is not excessive or too obsessive, as it can be detrimental. Schools, parents, and the wider community should work together to strike a balance between healthy competition and safeguarding students' mental and emotional well-being. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of everyone to ensure that the education system helps produce people of character, who can use their intelligence for the betterment of society, which was the true goal of education as envisioned by Martin Luther King Jr.",
                ", we also see similar forms of unhealthy competition in other countries like South Korea where students are often put under immense pressure to do well in their studies and excel beyond their peers. This level of competition can lead to anxiety, depression, and an inability to cope with stress.\nFurthermore, when excessive competition is introduced into the education system, it creates an environment where students focus on just obtaining good grades rather than truly learning and understanding the materials. For instance, in excessive competition, students may resort to dishonest means to secure higher grades like cheating. This defeats the true purpose of education which is to foster the love for learning and promote holistic development of students.\nIn conclusion, competition in education systems can have both positive and negative effects on students' lives and their characters. While competition is necessary for molding individuals into becoming better and more hardworking, excessiveness can lead to unhealthy behaviour and developmental issues in individuals. Therefore, it is important that the education system limits the extent of competition and provides necessary safeguards to promote a healthy and productive student environment that encourages personal growth and development through a sustainable approach."

            "human_gen_truncate": "tivism\", referring to measures that require minimal personal effort and have little practical effect beyond allowing people to derive satisfaction from the feeling that they have contributed. Social media gives people the ability to share information with a great many others, be it details of a certain cause, a viral video highlighting pertinent social issues, or evidence about one'sawareness about the situation \u2013 literally with a click of a button. Lamentably, this power exacerbates the \"]\"slacktivism\" problem as it makes people believe that they helped out on a social cause simply by sharing things over social media, rather than doing something practical. One pertinent example would be the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, meant to raise awareness and funds to aid those afflicted with Lou Gehrig'sdisease (which severely impairs motor activity). In the challenge, participants could choose between making a cash donation or the actual \"ice bucket\" challenge \u2013 and most opted for the latter, believing that it could make as much of a difference as a cash donation, while being more fun. In creating videos of themselves pouring iced water over their heads, people placed high value on their efforts spent and falsely perceive such an act as a substitute for more concrete action such as donating or volunteering to help out victims personally. Regrettably, social media may cause people to overrate their actions and feel that they have done tremendously to help out on certain societal causes when all they have done is post something related to the issue at hand.\nOf course, while a significant proportion of individuals are unwilling to put in concrete action towards social change, there is still a number of people who wish to do more. This is where social media serves as a first step towards greater accomplishments. With its ability to gather a sizeable target audience, in unprecedented magnitudes compared to that of television or newspapers, many more people are now aware of various social causes, which gives much more opportunities to engage people beyond mere understanding. A case in point would be that of Canadian Craig Kielburger, the founder of \"Free the Children\" (an organization that helps build schools worldwide). Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who \"liked\" the organisation'sFacebook page, only 2,000 committed to a trip overseas to help the cause. Even so, Kielburger was in praise of social media, stating that it \"opens the megaphone so much wider\u2026 when you finally look at that spectrum, we\"ve got more people who are finally making that journey\". Kielburger'sexample highlights the effectiveness of social media as a pilot for actions towards social change.\nAll in all, many cases have demonstrated the power of a single click when said click is accompanied by similar clicks from a great many other individuals. While a significant proportion of individuals passively receive and pass on information over social media, a sizeable them are willing to do more than just spread news. As such, social media has indeed attained its intention of being a catalyst of social change, whatever its scale.",

However, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have made it possible for individuals to share personal experiences and advocate for their rights. For example, survivors of sexual assault have used the #MeToo hashtag to share their stories and highlight the pervasiveness of sexual violence.\n\nDespite its advantages, social media activism has its limitations. One of the critiques of social media activism is that it can lead to slacktivism, where people participate in online activism without taking concrete actions in the real world. For instance, individuals may share hashtags or post photos in support of a cause without actually contributing to it. This has led to criticism that social media activism is a performative form of activism that does not lead to actual change.\n\nMoreover, social media activism faces the challenge of filtering out the noise and ensuring that the right messages are being amplified. Due to the sheer volume of content on social media, it can be difficult to differentiate between genuine activism and superficial activism. There are cases where fake accounts and bots have been created to spread false information and disrupt genuine activism.\n\nIn conclusion, social media activism has proven to be a powerful tool for raising awareness, mobilizing people and giving marginalized groups a platform to voice their concerns. While there are limitations such as slacktivism and information overload, it should not detract from the potential that social media activism has in bringing about change.

For instance, in 2014, a social media campaign consisting of millions of people around the world pouring buckets of ice water over their heads went viral to raise money for ALS research. While awareness of the disease was greatly increased, ultimately little money was actually raised by the method, and traditional fundraising methods generated far fewer donations, suggesting that social media activism may not always translate to concrete results. However, while this example shows the potential drawbacks of social media activism, it should be noted that the campaign still raised some money for the cause, and social media has immense potential to drive change, even if it may not result in immediate, concrete results.\n\nIn conclusion, while social media activism may have its limitations and drawbacks, it is a powerful tool that can be harnessed to drive meaningful change on both local and global levels. While it may not always translate into immediate results, social media's power lies in its ability to disseminate information quickly and engage millions of people worldwide, allowing us as a global community to come together and effect change on issues that we are passionate about.

While this notion is not entirely unfounded, it fails to account for the fact that social media activism can incite actual physical participation, with a good example being the Arab Spring. Social media played a significant role in the Arab Spring, which saw millions of citizens voicing their discontent through social media platforms, leading to mass demonstrations and the eventual toppling of several authoritarian governments throughout the Middle East. The mainstream media, who were slow to recognise the danger of the Arab Spring, could not match the speed and efficiency of social media in informing and mobilising citizens. As such, social media activism not only amplifies the voice of the people, but also makes it easier for ordinary citizens to organise and take part in peaceful protests to effect social change. It is therefore disingenuous to completely dismiss the effectiveness of social media activism without considering the steps beyond the screen that it can facilitate.\nIn conclusion, social media activism is indeed an effective tool for bringing about social change. Despite the criticism that social media sometimes attracts for being a site for \"slacktivism\", the fact remains that it can gather a vast audience, raising awareness of social issues locally and globally, and providing a platform for people to take part in actions towards a particular cause.

For example, one may share links, like social media pages or take part in online petitions without truly embodying the cause or taking meaningful action. Such behaviours are often seen as an ineffective means of activism, receiving criticisms for lacking meaningful results in achieving social change. Without physical participation or a meaningful act on behalf of the cause, there is a risk that social media activism may be seen as a superficial pursuit, where it is seen acceptable to \"like\" the cause, but much harder to make a tangible effort towards contributing to the cause. \n\nDespite criticisms and calls for action beyond social media, social media activism still holds unparalleled potential for creating change on a global scale. While a \"like\" or \"share\" on social media may be seen as trivial, it still serves as a method of sparking the conversation or bringing attention to an issue, and for many, it serves as a starting point to becoming more involved and doing something more meaningful towards a cause. In this regard, social media activism allows for an introduction to a cause that may have previously been overlooked and offers individual action opportunities that may have previously been unavailable. The effectiveness of social media activism is not determined by an individual's decision to give slacktivism the label of true activism but by the impact it has on creating genuine change. \n\nIn summary, the effectiveness of social media activism largely depends on perspective. While detractors suggest that it leads to slacktivism and may be seen as ineffective, the power of social media in reaching out to an audience and creating an initial spark for social change cannot be underestimated. Social media, therefore, has the potential to make a meaningful impact on issues that have been historically in the background, showing that a click or share may indeed make a difference.",
                "tivism\", and refers to the idea that social media activism only requires minimal effort and can create the illusion that one has made a difference. In contrast to traditional forms of activism that require physical participation in social events, social media activism requires only a \"click\" or a \"share\". Critics argue that this results in many who participate in such activism feeling that they have done their bit, or that their 'like' on Facebook is enough to remedy social problems, with little else required of them thereafter. In addition, there is the potential dilution of the content published on social media as oversaturation of social media users sharing similar content may lead to some users being fatigue of such issues. \n\nHowever, I believe these arguments are not strong enough to discredit the effectiveness of activism via social media. For one, \"slacktivism\"is not inherent to social media activism alone. Any form of activism can be subject to individuals who participate minimally, regardless of whether it is through social media or traditional means. Moreover, while social media is often regarded by critics as a \"slacktivism\" platform, it has in fact played an important role in mobilizing individuals to take physical action. For instance, the Arab Spring is one of the most notable examples of how social media was the catalyst in using the power of a 'like' to incite and mobilize individuals to organize physical protests and rallies. Social media is also a crucial platform for organizing protest rallies and disseminating information about events quickly and effectively. In other words, social media may not be the most ubiquitous or effective method of physical activity, but it can be used as a stepping stone to achieve indeed that, necessary in its own right, especially considering the sizeable reach and impact that it is capable of. \n\nIn conclusion, while there may be some detractors who insist that social media activism is not effective, I believe that social media is a powerful tool for activism. With its ability to reach out to a massive audience, social media is a platform that can provide citizens around the world with a voice, an understanding and a power to contribute towards social change. As such, social media activism should be considered a method in which to empower individuals to make concrete actions towards creating a fairer, more just world.",
                "tivism\", and refers to the phenomenon of people using social media to show their support for a certain cause without actually taking any physical action to help towards the cause. For instance, just clicking \"like\" on a post about environmental conservation on Facebook may make one feel that they are doing their part, when in reality, no tangible effort has been expended. Critics argue that social media activism may serve as a placebo, giving the illusion of making a difference and making its participants complacent towards actual physical activism. Thus, many believe that social media is not as effective in bringing about social change, and that traditional forms of activism such as street protests still hold greater power to bring about concrete change.\nDespite the criticism leveled against social media activism, I believe that its effectiveness cannot be understated. Social media has consistently served as a powerful tool to create awareness, facilitate debates and discussions, and connect individuals from all across the globe by fostering an environment of shared experiences. It has allowed current issues to be brought to light, discussed, and brought about social change to an extent that was once impossible. Ultimately, social media activism may not be a panacea for all the world's problems, or be able to replace traditional forms of activism, but it remains an entrenched and valuable tool to supplement activism efforts, and one that should not be overlooked.",
                "tivism\", referring to the phenomenon of individuals simply clicking a \"like\" or \"share\" button without actually doing anything more substantial to help the cause. Critics argue that social media activism is often fleeting and lacks the staying power for long-term social change as it does not require individuals to take physical action. Furthermore, the anonymity provided by social media gives rise to inauthentic or disingenuous activism where people may claim to be deeply concerned about an issue, but only do so superficially to appear virtuous in the eyes of their followers. While these criticisms hold weight, social media still remains an effective platform to promote social change, as it can serve to engage individuals who may have otherwise not been exposed to the issue at all. By raising awareness and getting people talking about the issues, social media serves as a crucial first step in rallying support for larger movements and physical action.\nIn conclusion, social media has undeniable potential when it comes to activism and social change. While it may not be a silver bullet solution, it is a powerful tool that can greatly amplify the reach and influence of individuals and collectives seeking change. Social media's capacity for global outreach, immediacy, and accessibility make it a potent tool to raise awareness and motivate action. However, to truly bring about lasting change, social media activism must be backed by real-world activism and tangible outcomes.",
                "tivism\", and refers to the phenomenon of individuals participating in activism efforts via online means but without meaningful, real-life action. Critics argue that the relative ease of liking, sharing and commenting on social media posts may discourage individuals from taking the time and effort to attend physical rallies or volunteering activities. However, \"slacktivism\" is not a new phenomenon created by social media. In fact, it has always been an issue even before social media came into play. The difference now lies in the unprecedented reach of social media that can quickly disseminate information to millions of individuals all at once. Moreover, social media does not preclude individuals from participating in real-life activism; rather, it provides an additional avenue for people to become exposed to activism and can function as a gateway to participation in real-life activism. For instance, the #MeToo movement on social media was criticised for being an example of \"slacktivism\", but it served as a catalyst to subsequent, hands-on activities like demonstrations and legal reforms, highlighting the catalytic role social media activism can have. As such, it is incorrect to say that social media promotes \"slacktivism\" and instead it should be viewed as an additional and influential tool that can be used alongside other forms of activism.\nIn conclusion, while detractors may claim that social media activism is not as effective as traditional forms of activism, the astounding outreach of social media and the ease at which it can connect people across nations have made it an increasingly important resource for social change. Social media offers a platform for individuals to voice their concerns, offer support and engage in activism in ways that would have been impossible in the past. Hence, it is essential to recognise the power that social media offers as a means for effecting social change and embrace its potential to maximise activism efforts throughout the world.",
                "tivism\", to describe a phenomenon where individuals feel like they are contributing to a cause by simply \"liking\" or \"sharing\" a post or photo. In essence, they feel like they have done their part to help solve a particular issue without taking actual concrete steps to participate in the issue. However, this argument holds little water as it is important to note that social media activism is often just the first step towards getting involved in a cause and should not be seen as an end in itself. Social media allows one to raise awareness about social issues, and this has the potential to be an important game-changer to move people to take more concrete action and contributing more meaningfully to a cause. The key to a successful social media activism is to it as a tool to engage people, with the eventual hope that individuals will take the next step to translate what they've learned online into active participation in real life.\nIn conclusion, social media can indeed make a difference in the world through activism as long as the tools are used correctly. It has a tremendous power to reach out to a large audience and create a sense of compassion for others' plight, often resulting in momentum for those movements to snowball into something more significant. However, it is critical to remember that the purpose of social media activism is to raise awareness about or spark interest in a cause, and if one wishes to bring about genuine change, it is essential to take concrete steps towards imparting one's newfound awareness or interest into actions that create an impact on the ground. Social media activism should be seen as only the initial step towards real-world action.",
                "tivism\", meaning that people do not actively participate in physical events but instead simply (and typically, easily) share something related to the cause on social media. While it may be true to a certain extent that social media activism can bring about a sense of armchair slacktivism \u2013 where people only post articles or thoughts related to social issues without taking any tangible steps to solve the underlying problems \u2013 it is still important to bear in mind that sharing and disseminating information on social media may have an organizational effect, encouraging other people to join the cause and take action. To illustrate, during the Arab Spring revolution, the combination of multimedia messages on social media and the extent of its uptake was instrumental in mobilising mass protests against governments in the region. Within minutes of a reported death of a protester in Tunisia, a Facebook event had already been organised for a vigil in honor of the deceased. Through utilising Twitter and DDoS attacks, activists in Egypt were able to bring down the government's websites while keeping protesters updated with information. The output of social media was essentially collective action in physical protests and events which demonstrates its effectiveness in mobilising people to bring about social change, even in instances where there may be a high level of virtual engagement.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that social media activism is effective in bringing about change, with its strength in mobilising a large number of people for a cause being unparalleled in comparison to traditional forms of media. However, there is a potential for the \"slacktivism\" phenomenon to arise, and it is the onus of individuals to take upon themselves to actively participate in events that push for social change in order to ensure that action is taken beyond a retweet or a \"like\". Nonetheless, with the ability to reach a large audience and the potential to spur others to take up a cause, social media activism is undeniably an important tool in the modern age for change-makers around the world.",
                "tivism\". It refers to the phenomenon of individuals publicly showing support for a social or political cause through online participation but without making any real contributions to the cause, such as donating money, volunteering or attending protests. In other words, online activism may lack the tangible impact that more traditional forms of activism provide, as the ease of just clicking or \"liking\" a post cannot match up to the physical presence and action of traditional activism. However, I argue that while slacktivism may indeed be prevalent, it is important to note that social media activism does not completely replace conventional modes of activism, but rather supplements it. Those who engage in slacktivism may do so as a gateway drug of sorts, gradually moving on to more concrete forms of activism as they become more invested in the cause. Moreover, even if social media activism does not immediately translate to concrete action, it may serve to spread awareness and generate discussions about an issue, acting as a necessary starting point for a more significant change in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, while the efficacy of social media activism has its limitations, it is undeniable that it has played an instrumental role in social change in the modern age. Social media activism leverages the intimacy and reachability of social media, making it an ideal means to convey crucial information that can inspire and incite people in societies all around the world. Even if it is not always the most direct of forms of activism, its capacity to mobilise, educate and inspire makes social media activism an invaluable and effective means towards change."

However, in societies where academic performance is prized, schoolchildren are paying a heavy price. While Singapore has been largely successful in global education rankings, constantly ranking one of the top 5 nations globally, at the same time students in Singapore are reporting symptoms of anxiety and stress related to school as early as primary school, and there have been extreme cases where pupils have been driven to suicide. Youths often face long days at school, hours of homework, and extra classes, which are having an impact on mental wellbeing. A recent report by OECD found that overall, the nation'spupils reported higher levels of anxiety than average. In Japan, 659 Japanese aged 20 or under died by their own hand in 2019, which was an increase of 60 from the year before. In China, children as young as five are pushed hard in sporting arenas and studies. Even in Singapore, toddlers as young as eight months old are attending lessons and enrichment classes.\nAt the other end of the demographic spectrum, \"retirement\" is a word that many look forward to, where one can be happy and stress-free after a lifetime of work. However, in today'ssociety, the elderly are also not as happy as they should be. It is true that the elderly lead more comfortable lives as compared to one or two generations ago. Their children work hard to provide for them and they also are eligible for subsidies from the government. Hence, the elderly are able to spend their retirement years without having to worry much about daily necessities. Yet, in Singapore, the number of elderly people taking their own lives reached a record high in 2017. Some 129 people aged 60 and older committed suicide, despite the total number of suicides declining in the same year. Those who are sick, have little or no family or dependent help and are socially isolated may be more susceptible. This is because most would not want to be a burden to others as most adult children lead busy lives and may not be able to give as much attention to parents as the elderly need. The social interaction and emotional support they require are not there and therefore, elderly isolation has caused many elderly to feel unhappy and some are even driven to the brink of depression.\nHowever, not all hope is lost, as happiness still can be attained today due to the government'sefforts to raise the level of happiness in the country. In the recent Covid-19 outbreak, the government implemented social distancing to help Singapore cope with reducing the spread of the virus. However, social distancing has been hard on many, especially the vulnerable and the elderly. Hence, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) has deployed volunteers to help this segment of society in many ways such as picking up their groceries and accompanying them for hospital appointments. These volunteers call the elderly citizens once every week to check in on them, and these elderly often quote that it is good to have someone to chat with them. This shows that the government has done much to provide the elderly in Singapore with companionship and assistance, ensuring that their well-being is being looked after in their retirement years.\nIn the final analysis, we may face many problems in today'sworld, with rising costs of living as well as the presence of many conflicts in the world. The stress and pressure of society acting on people can result in them not being happy, and even the benefits we have today may actually be a source of sadness.

            "human_gen_truncate": " Hence, this makes the pursuit of the Arts not an option but an integral part of the growth of the people in promoting the emotional wellbeing of individuals in a stressful and demanding world.\nAt the same time, the increasingly apathetic culture of men and the diminishing role of religion in many people'slives have also disrupted our moral compass. In truth, the Arts are now increasingly recognized for its soft power and ability to reach out to matters of the heart and shaping our moral beliefs and teaching us new things. The Arts have always been respected for its profundity and its ability to provoke and stimulate one in unleashing one'smoral values such as compassion, grace, forgiveness, humane, humility and so forth. For instance, the intellectually-stimulating art piece of the \"Age of Innocence\" painting which subsequently founded the novel itself does provoke thoughts among readers in defining their definition of innocence and forces them to reconsider the various aspects behind morality with that of social acceptability. In addition, new dramas such as \"Mrs Warren'sProfession\" by George Bernard Shaw written in the late Victorian period seeks to confront the traditional perceptions and attitudes towards prostitution by portraying the protagonist'smother as one who resorted to it not by choice but by circumstance, causing us to sympathize with her and acknowledging the ills of our capitalist system. The Arts is therefore an effective tool in contributing to the moralistic and ethical development of people in society and engineering strong notions of values and culture, which in some ways is also reflective of our way of life. Thus, the moral qualities that the Arts brings make it not an option but an integral part of the growth of the people in shaping one'smoral discernment.\nIn addition, the role of the Arts in our exercise of our freedom of speech in this increasingly pluralistic world is imperative in us arguing for the need of the Arts in our daily lives in expressing our right and view to things. Through the ability to exercise our freedom of speech we are able to bring about new changes in improving the lives of others. The Arts, which can take place in different forms such as government feedback channels like the \"Daily Talks\" which flames Trump and his policies or even citizenry platforms such as REACH forums in Singapore allows for greater participation in society which promotes a more inclusive and integrated society in fostering stronger national bonds and unity among fellow citizens. These channels of the Arts or even in local films such as \"Ah Boys to Men\" by renowned local producer Jack Neo also seeks to express his personal thoughts of what every Singaporean man will have to experience in National Service, which is vital in reinforcing the cultural identity and national belonging to one'snative country and calls for society with greater social cohesion in it. Yet, while the Arts allow for the freedom of expression, it should be recognized that this should be conducted along with personal discretion in promoting social cohesion. In the established reporting of the Charlie Hebdo incident, the social satirical magazine that mocked the prophet Mohammad experienced severe backlash for its inappropriateness and insensitivity to Islam. Hence, the Arts while on the pretext of preserving and enabling freedom of expression should also be closely regulated in order to not endanger social cohesion and promote internal strife. Thus, the room for freedom of expression, if carefully regulated, makes the pursuit of the arts not an option but an integral part in the growth of the people.\nSince time immemorial, the Arts have always been regarded as one that was secondary to that of meeting the basic needs as iterated under Maslow'shierarchy of needs. However, in an increasingly affluent and stressful world, the need for the Arts has become vital and important among people across the world due to the benefits bestowed upon the emotional, moral and the sense of national belonging in an individual.",

Through the Arts, individuals are given a platform to express themselves and their ideas freely, without censorship or fear of retribution. The Arts are therefore essential in promoting democracy and freedom, and in combating the erosion of human rights in modern-day society. The power of the Arts as a tool to promote social justice has been evidenced through many social movements throughout history, including the civil rights movement in America and the Arab Spring demonstrations across the middle-east. The Arts can act as a catalyst for change, and provide a powerful way for individuals to speak out against injustices and effect real change in society.\nIn conclusion, the Arts are no longer a luxury or a mere pastime but an essential and integral part of society.

In a society that is constantly changing and full of complexities, the Arts provide a platform for dialogue about social issues and help individuals to more effectively develop their own moral compasses. Through the Arts, individuals gain access to diverse ideas and perspectives which challenge conventional beliefs and inspires new ways of thinking. For example, the recent film \"Crazy Rich Asians\" helped to challenge traditional notions about race and representation, resulting in powerful discussions about representation in powerful and dynamic ways. In this way, the Arts allow individuals to think critically and engage with the world in more sophisticated and nuanced ways, ultimately leading to a more compassionate and empathic society.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the Arts, is not just about entertainment or a luxury for the elites.

Great works of literature such as \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" and \"Animal Farm\" provide valuable moral and ethical insights that help us understand our place in the world and issue us with the necessary tools to make informed and intelligent decisions in our daily lives. The Arts also provide a platform for individuals to express their own values and beliefs and thereby advocate for social causes that they are passionate about.

Such values are integral to the development of a harmonious and cohesive society, where people can learn to appreciate the differences in each other and respect one another's opinions and beliefs.

Art performances held in Singapore have always been seen as a platform to explore the various avenues through which Singaporeans can understand people of other cultures and gain a deeper appreciation of the rich cultural heritage that Singapore possesses. This explanatory process not only cultivates a cultural understanding but also acts in removing social prejudices and barriers. For instance, events like the \"Singapore Night Festival\" and the \"Chingay Parade\" showcase the importance of the Arts in bringing about social cohesion and rallying people from all walks of life to celebrate and appreciate the uniqueness of the Singaporean culture. Therefore, the Arts are an important contributor to the morally and socially transformative power that unites the different races and cultures that make up Singapore\u2019s community.\nIn conclusion, the Arts, though seemingly unrelated to the practical demands of our lives, play an integral role in sustaining the moral and cultural values of Singapore whereby the unique cultural backgrounds blend harmoniously in the cosmopolitan city-state.

They provide a platform for individuals to convey important social messages that would otherwise be ignored in the mainstream media. For instance, the film \"The Hunger Games\" sparked discussions on the socio-political commentary of the world's current fascination on reality television and its impact. The play \"The Laramie Project\" addresses the issues of homophobia and hate crime that could otherwise slip through the cracks of society. Without the Arts, it would be hard for society to drive positive social change as it provides a much-needed catalyst to move and provoke discussions on sensitive social issues.

For instance, by studying the works of George Orwell in Animal Farm, people learn about the effects of totalitarianism and the importance of democracy in governance, values that are relevant in many modern societies. Similarly, film enthusiasts learn about the impact of socio-political and economic factors on society and the interplay between different power structures in shaping human interactions. Art, therefore, educates and shapes individual perspectives on global issues and encourages creative problem-solving approaches that are useful in fields not just limited to the Arts.\nIn conclusion, whilst it is understandable that some may argue that the Arts only have limited economic value, the critical function it serves to individuals as a source of escapism that permits for the bettering of emotional and psychological health cannot be dismissed.

            "prompt": "ARE PEOPLE MORE WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES TODAY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "ay have resulted in uprisings and protests \u2013 done with the aim to propagate social causes. The use of social media platforms to spread political beliefs has seen the overthrow of two presidents, Hosni Murbarak and Morsi from the Egyptian government since the Arab Spring. Hence, the power of social media in championing social causes is undeniable which has led to people becoming more willing to sacrifice their lives for their causes because their sacrifices are now, at the very least, seen by the public eye. Another example would be the demonstrations that begin in Ecuador in 2019. When the government announced that it was taking public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this change led to a sharp rise in petrol prices, which many said they could not afford. Indigenous groups feared that the measure would result in increased costs for public transport and food, and that their rural communities would be hardest hit. Protesters blocked highways, stormed parliament and clashed with security forces as they demanded an end to austerity and the return of fuel subsidies. The government backed down after days of mass protests and the action came to an end. From these examples, it is clear that rising expectations that people have in ruling governments have led to increased willingness among people to make sacrifices for their causes today.\nMoreover, I agree with the view that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today because they are subjected to feelings of unjust given that they may not be entitled to certain benefits or merit goods in the country. These feelings of unfairness are further exacerbated when governments of other countries are able to provide the citizens with what they want and need, thus leading to a higher quality of life. An example to illustrate this is Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani school pupil and education activist, who is known for her activism for rights to education and for women, especially in the Swat Valley, where the Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Despite an assassination attempt to kill Yousafzai and her father by the Taliban, she continues to advocate for rights of women to education, and even spoke at the United Nations to call for worldwide access to education. Yousafzai'ssacrifice of her safety \u2013 _as shown by how the Taliban attempted to assassinate her \u2013 enabled her to further her cause to promote education for women. It was done with the aim to eradicate violation of women'sright, where a lack of provision of education to women has resulted in the unfair and inhumane treatment towards women. Another person who has made sacrifices to stand up strongly for what she believes in is 17-year-old Greta Thunberg. Thunberg began a global movement by skipping school: starting in August 2018, she spent her days camped out in front of the Swedish Parliament, holding a sign painted in black letters on a white background that read: \"School Strike for Climate Change\". In the time since, she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history. This shows the strength in Thunberg'sbelief in environmental preservation, and how she truly believes that change must happen in the world, such that she is willing to make sacrifices to inspire people to share her vision. Therefore, feelings of unjust have resulted in activists such as Malala being willing in making sacrifices which they deem to be for a worthy cause.\nIn essence, while some people may argue that people today make sacrifices because of ulterior motives that they may have such as gaining international popularity and not to simply promote their causes, my stand is that people today are more willing to make sacrifices because of a genuine need to promote their causes. The influence of celebrity culture, rising expectations of ruling governments and feelings of unfairness felt by people would further enhance their willingness to effect societal change. Therefore, it is justifiable to argue that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " issues. The recent wave of social justice movements and the significant participation of people worldwide reflect this trend, and there is no denying that people are more willing to make sacrifices today to address social issues that affect the world collectively.\n\nHowever, it is vital to acknowledge that the concept of sacrifice is subjective as it is heavily influenced by individual circumstances, socio-economic status, and cultural norms. Some people are willing to make significant sacrifices for a cause they believe in, whereas others may not share the same level of enthusiasm. This difference in attitude and aptitude towards sacrifice transcends culture, generation, or geography.\n\nFurthermore, the progressive nature of various societies and communities plays an essential role in shaping people's attitudes towards sacrifice. In some societies, being part of a community means making numerous sacrifices for the greater good. In such cases, the adults in the community would set an example of their levels of sacrifice, which the younger generation would follow. However, it is worth noting that this stereotype of younger people \"lacking a sense of community\" is not necessarily accurate. Younger generations are more attuned to global issues and are willing to contribute towards systemic change, but they may not follow the same modes of sacrifice that were seen in previous generations. \n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to paint all people of a certain generation, or society with the same brush, regarding their willingness to make sacrifices. It is undeniable that societal progress, technological advancements, and global awareness have impacted daily life significantly, and our attitudes towards sacrifice have changed accordingly. However, each person's approach to sacrifice is highly individualistic, influenced by their beliefs, values, and social circumstances. Nonetheless, we can safely say that some issues transcend national, cultural, or generational borders, and people are more willing to make sacrifices today for causes they deem significant.",

                "ay also contribute to people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes. With the rise of democracy, citizens are given more power to ensure that their leaders are held accountable for their actions \u2013 or inactions. A result of this is the increased scrutiny that people now place on their governments, especially in areas such as social welfare, equal opportunity and public healthcare. This means that when people feel that their government is not doing enough to address certain issues, they believe that they need to do their part too. Take, for example, the current COVID-19 pandemic \u2013 many ordinary citizens have come forward to volunteer their time, create face masks for those in need and donate funds to support healthcare workers. These selfless acts demonstrate a willingness to make sacrifices for the betterment of society and also showcase how expectations of governments instil a sense of responsibility in the public to take action.\nLastly, people may also be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. For instance, many young Singaporeans who are unable to secure a place in local universities may choose to study abroad despite the higher costs involved \u2013 simply because they believe that they are entitled to the best education that they can afford. This illustrates how people are willing to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the betterment of their future prospects or for reasons that they believe are worthy of the financial investment.\nIn conclusion, despite the existence of individuals using causes for selfish pursuits, it can still be seen that people are increasingly willing to make sacrifices for their causes today. This can be attributed to the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations of governments that people have today and the desire to attain equal opportunities provided by other countries \u2013 amongst other factors. Regardless of the reasons behind these sacrifices, it is refreshing to see that people are willing to take action to benefit society as a whole.",
                "ay is another reason why people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes. With the rise of social media, individuals are now more connected to global and local news than ever before. This has led to an increase in awareness of issues and injustices that affect people all over the world. As a result, individuals are more likely to expect their governments to address these issues and take concrete action against them. When governments fail to live up to these expectations, individuals often take it upon themselves to push for change. An example of this can be seen in the Hong Kong protests of 2019, where Hong Kong citizens took to the streets to protest against the extradition bill proposed by their government. Despite facing police brutality, arrests and tear gas, protesters continued to fight for their cause, with many even sacrificing their safety and well-being for the greater good of the movement. This shows how people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes because they expect their governments to take decisive action in response to social injustice and other issues that affect them.\nFinally, feelings of unfairness and a sense of entitlement to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries also contribute to why people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes. With the rise of globalization, people are now more connected and aware of different standards of living and opportunities around the world. As a result, individuals may feel a sense of entitlement to these opportunities and benefits, and become frustrated when they are not able to access them or are denied them. This can manifest itself in various ways, such as demands for free education or healthcare, or protests against policies that are seen as unfair or discriminatory. An example of this can be seen in the student-led movement for gun control in the United States, where many students who have lost friends or family members to gun violence have come together to demand stricter gun control laws. Despite facing criticism and opposition from various groups, these students have continued to fight for their cause, often sacrificing their time and personal safety in the process. Therefore, it can be argued that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today because they feel a sense of entitlement and a desire for a fairer society.",
                "ay contribute to the willingness to make sacrifices for causes. In the past, people may have felt helpless in the face of oppression and injustice, with little power to effect change. However, in today's world, there is a growing trend of democratic governance and transparency, where governments are held accountable for their actions and decisions. As such, people have come to expect more from their governments, and are not afraid to take action when their expectations are not met. For example, the recent protests in Hong Kong against the proposed extradition bill were largely driven by people's dissatisfaction with the government's lack of respect for their demands and their belief in democracy. Many protesters made sacrifices such as risking their safety and freedom to make their voices heard. Therefore, this shows how people's higher expectations for their governments have led to greater willingness to make sacrifices for their causes.\nLastly, some people may be willing to make sacrifices for their causes because of feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. For instance, refugees who are escaping war and persecution in their home countries may be willing to make sacrifices such as leaving behind their possessions, family and homes, in the hope of obtaining better opportunities for themselves and their children. This is because they may feel that their government is not doing enough to protect them, and that they are being denied basic human rights and opportunities that other citizens of other countries are entitled to. By making the sacrifice of fleeing their country, they hope to gain access to these opportunities and live a better life. Hence, this demonstrates how feelings of unfairness can drive people to make sacrifices for their causes.\nIn conclusion, there are various factors that contribute to people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes. While some may do so merely in the pursuit of fame and fortune, others may genuinely believe in their cause and be willing to fight for it. These factors include the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments today, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. Ultimately, it is important to recognize and acknowledge the sacrifices made by individuals for their causes, as they are often driven by a deep sense of passion and commitment to creating a better world.",
                "ay also contribute to people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes. With the advent of democracy and greater access to information in today's society, people are more aware of their rights and are more inclined to demand for change from their governments. This is evident in how people have been more vocal and active in protests and demonstrations to demand for social justice and political reform. For example, in the Hong Kong protests of 2019, citizens came together to protest against the government's proposal to introduce an extradition bill that could lead to citizens being tried in mainland China's courts, which they believed would undermine Hong Kong's autonomy and freedoms. The protesters faced potential retaliation such as arrest, imprisonment, or worse, but they continued with their cause in spite of these dangers. This illustrates how people are willing to make sacrifices for their causes, even if it means facing severe consequences.\nAdditionally, people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes could also stem from a perceived unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. In many cases, people are driven to advocate for causes because they believe that their governments are not doing enough to address issues that affect their livelihoods. They may feel that their governments are not allocating sufficient resources towards public goods such as healthcare, education, and housing, which they are entitled to. Thus, they are motivated to make sacrifices for their causes to demand for change and ensure that their governments fulfill their obligations to provide for their citizens. An example of this is the recent demand for climate justice, where many young activists have been sacrificing their time and resources to demand that more be done to mitigate climate change. They argue that their future is at stake if leaders do not take action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and take a more proactive approach to transitioning towards renewable energy. They are propelled by a sense of injustice, that their futures are being compromised due to the failure of others to act on their behalf.\nIn conclusion, while there are cases of people who are more concerned with their personal gain than promoting their causes, there are also those who are willing to make sacrifices to advocate for change. With the advent of social media and the influence of celebrities, people are more likely to engage in activism and use their platforms for good. Additionally, the higher expectations that people have of their governments today and a sense of injustice if they are not entitled to merit goods could also motivate people to make sacrifices for their causes. Ultimately, the willingness to make sacrifices for one's cause is driven by a sense of purpose and belief in promoting positive change.",
                "ay also lead to an increased willingness of people to make sacrifices for their causes. This is especially evident in democracies, where citizens have a say in how their country is governed. When citizens feel that their government is not doing enough to address issues that they feel strongly about, they may resort to taking matters into their own hands. For instance, in the recent Hong Kong protests, citizens took to the streets to protest against the proposed extradition bill that they felt would infringe upon their autonomy. Despite the risks of arrest and police brutality, many citizens continued to participate in the protests, with some even sacrificing their livelihoods for the cause. This highlights how people are willing to make sacrifices for a cause they believe in when they perceive that their government is not meeting their expectations.\nFinally, people may also be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes due to a sense of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. This is particularly true in the context of globalisation, where countries are becoming increasingly interconnected. Citizens may feel that they are missing out on benefits or opportunities that other countries are enjoying, and this may create a sense of injustice. This can spur citizens to advocate for change and make sacrifices for their causes. For example, in the Philippines, environmental activists have been protesting against the mining activities of multinational corporations that are causing environmental degradation and displacement of indigenous communities. These activists are willing to make sacrifices such as facing threats to their personal safety and imprisonment in order to protect their country's natural resources and the rights of marginalised communities.\n\nIn conclusion, while some people may make sacrifices for their causes in the pursuit of fame and fortune, there are many others who genuinely believe in their causes and are willing to make sacrifices to promote them. The significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments today, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries are all factors that can contribute to an increased willingness to make sacrifices for causes.

With the prevalence of information technology and social media, people today are better informed about global affairs and are more conscious about the political climate in their countries. Therefore, this has led to an increase in expectations and demands for their governments to take action on issues such as climate change, income inequality and healthcare. When governments do not meet these expectations, people are more likely to take matters into their own hands and promote change through their own actions and sacrifices. For example, in the recent climate protests worldwide, young activists such as Greta Thunberg have made headlines for their activism and were willing to sacrifice their time and even education to fight for the cause of climate change. In this way, the higher expectations that people have in their governments today have led to an increase in people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes.\nLast but not least, people may also be willing to make sacrifices for their causes out of feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. With globalization, people today are more aware of the disparities between countries in terms of access to healthcare, education and economic opportunities. For instance, in some countries, people may not have access to quality education or healthcare due to poverty and lack of resources. This can lead to feelings of unfairness if people are not entitled to the same benefits and opportunities as those provided by more developed countries. Therefore, people may be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes in the hope that they can improve their own situations and fight for a better future.\nIn conclusion, people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes today may be influenced by the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. While there may be some who make sacrifices for their causes in pretense, there are also many who are genuine in their commitment to promoting change and inspiring others to do the same.

                "ay could also contribute to people's increased willingness to make sacrifices for their causes. With the internet, people are now more informed and knowledgeable on global issues. This leads to a higher awareness of the shortcomings of their governments in addressing these issues. Hence, people may feel that in order to bring about transformational change, they may have to step up and make sacrifices instead of relying on their governments. For instance, during the recent COVID-19 pandemic, the government's inability to provide adequate resources such as masks and hand sanitizer led to individuals taking matters into their own hands. Many volunteers banded together to sew masks, donate hand sanitizers, and distribute them to vulnerable communities, all at a great personal cost. Additionally, healthcare workers around the world have also made the decision to put their lives on the line to save others during this pandemic by working tirelessly in hospitals despite the risks they face daily. This reflects the sentiments of people who feel that in order to seek change in society, they may have to take the lead instead of waiting on their governments. As such, people may be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes now, in order to effect change which they cannot rely on their governments to bring about.\n\nLastly, people may be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to the feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to the same merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. This is especially the case in certain developing countries where merit goods such as education or healthcare are not readily available to all its citizens. In such cases, those who are better off may feel a sense of obligation to give back to their communities by setting up charitable organizations or foundations to provide such goods to those in need. An example of this would be the \"Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation\" which aims to improve healthcare and reduce poverty around the world. This foundation was started by Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, and his wife Melinda in order to give back to society and improve the quality of life for people in developing countries. Hence, this reflects how people may be driven to make sacrifices in order to provide opportunities for those in need and improve access to merit goods.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that people make sacrifices to gain fame and fortune, there are still many people who are genuine in their pursuit to promote their causes. This could be attributed to the increased significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations from governments and feelings of unfairness if others do not have access to merit goods.

                "ay have also contributed to the willingness for people to make sacrifices for their causes. In developed countries with established democracies, people have grown accustomed to having a say in how their governments are run and the policies that are implemented. Consequently, if people feel that their government is not doing enough to address issues that they care about, they may take matters into their own hands and make sacrifices to promote their causes in the hope of forcing governments to act upon them. For instance, in Australia, school students organized large protests in the country's major cities, demanding that the government take action against climate change. These young activists were willing to skip school and face penalties for truancy, in order to draw attention to the issue of climate change and urge the government to act upon it. This is an example illustrating how people are willing to make sacrifices for their causes, when they feel that their government is not doing enough to address issues that they care about.\nLastly, feelings of unfairness and inequality may also drive people to make sacrifices for their causes. In today's globalized world, people are more aware of the vast disparities that exist between different countries, of which some may not be entitled to benefits that are readily available in other countries. For example, developed countries such as the United States or Singapore may provide their citizens with better healthcare, education, and social welfare than developing countries such as Cambodia or Laos. When people become aware of such disparities, they may feel that they are being treated unfairly, and may start to advocate for change by making sacrifices for their causes. This can be seen in the work of various non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that work to promote global social justice, such as Oxfam and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res. Members of these NGOs may travel to some of the world's poorest countries, or into dangerous conflict zones, to provide aid and support to the most vulnerable populations. These people believe that everyone should be entitled to equal rights and opportunities, and are willing to make sacrifices to bring about change.\nTo conclude, people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to several reasons, including the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments today, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. While there may be cases where people make sacrifices solely for personal gain, the vast majority of those who take up causes do so out of a genuine desire to make a positive impact on the world. Thus, let us continue to acknowledge the sacrifices made by these individuals to promote the greater good, while also holding accountable those who may exploit the causes they claim to promote.",

People now demand more accountability and transparency from their governments, whether it be in areas of social justice, economic policy or environmental protection. Additionally, people feel that they have a right to express their opinions and to have their voices heard. An example of this would be the recent Hong Kong protests, where many Hong Kong citizens were driven to make sacrifices and take to the streets in protest against the proposed extradition bill by the Hong Kong government. Despite facing significant backlash from law enforcement officials, many of these citizens were driven by the desire to fight for their right to freedom and justice. This shows how the expectations of people have impacted their willingness to make sacrifices, as many are now more determined than ever to fight for their rights and causes against their governments' policies.\nLastly, the growing sentiments of unfairness and injustice if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries have also influenced people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes. For instance, there are many migrants and refugees who are willing to risk their lives to cross the Mediterranean Sea, in the hopes of seeking better opportunities in Europe. Despite the risks involved, these individuals feel that they are being denied basic necessities such as education, healthcare and basic human rights in their home countries. Hence, they make the decision to leave their families and home countries in search of a better life abroad. This illustrates how the feeling of unfairness and injustice have motivated people to make sacrifices for their causes.\nIn conclusion, people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes today can be attributed to the influence of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. While some may argue that sacrifices are made for self-interest, there are many examples that show how people are willing to put the needs of their causes above their own.

In previous decades, people tend to rely heavily on their governments to solve societal issues and address their needs. However, as people become more socially aware and connected through the internet, they realize that they possess the power to effect change in society and not just rely on their governments. This shift in mentality has led to an increase in individuals standing up for their causes and being vocal about issues they care about. A recent example is the youth-led movement against climate change, which transcends national borders and demands for immediate action from governments. Through this movement, young people worldwide are making sacrifices to advocate for sustainable living and promoting a cleaner environment for future generations.\nFinally, a sense of unfairness and perceived inequalities in merit goods and benefits provided by other countries may also motivate people to make sacrifices for their causes. In many developed countries, citizens enjoy basic rights such as healthcare, education, and social welfare as they are seen as merit goods provided by the government. However, in developing countries, many do not have access to these merit goods, and they view it as unfair that they cannot enjoy the same level of basic rights as citizens of developed countries. This sense of unfairness motivates many individuals to advocate for equal opportunities for all, and they are willing to make sacrifices to ensure that this happens.\nIn conclusion, while some people may make sacrifices for their causes with ulterior motives, there is a growing number of individuals who are genuinely committed to making a difference. Celebrities tapping on their popularity, higher expectations of governments, and the sense of unfairness in merit goods all contribute to the increase in willingness to make sacrifices for causes.

            "human_gen_truncate": "rely heavily on their senses and most stereotypes and judgements have no logical bearing. These are usually dependent on what one considers \"normal\" relative to one'sown background and understanding of the world around him or her. One'scharacter and upbringing also plays a huge role in determining how one views the differences in languages around him. As such, differences in the way people look, act and talk all contribute towards how we discriminate against people. In more extreme cases, the Rohingya crisis is a sad example of how people are discriminated against purely because of their language and background. In August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar'sarmy on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border into Bangladesh. The United Nations has described this as a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\" and ordered the Buddhist-majority country to take measures to protect members of its Rohingya community from genocide. At least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the month after the violence broke out, and as of today, more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled the country and tens of thousands have been killed. From this example, we can clearly see how despite the similarities people may share, such as living in the same country and even similarities in their languages, other differences such as ethnicity can result in massive conflicts which bring about much pain and suffering. This illustrates how speaking the same language does not necessarily leave the world better off as hoped for.\nYet, it cannot be denied that there are advantages to everyone speaking the same language. Having a common language would eliminate the communication barriers that exist between people. Despite the fact that there are many races and ethnicities of people living within Singapore, with each having their own unique language, English remains a common language that unites everyone. This enables the population, especially those born in later generations, to communicate and interact with one another with ease. This has resulted in numerous benefits for society as people are able to come together to make positive changes. Research programmes in tertiary institutes have had teams make breakthrough discoveries in areas such as stem cell research and bioengineering. This would have been much more challenging to accomplish if language barriers existed between members of the teams. This shows the important role that a common language can play as a fundamental tool for effective communication and how it could make the world better off.\nAll in all, I believe that a common language does not necessarily lead to the world being a better place if the collective aim of everyone is not to benefit humanity. It has been asked, \"If we were blind and had no choice, would we still hate each other by the tone of our voice?\" This aptly describes how, in spite of a common language, discrimination and prejudice will exist in society unless we make a conscious effort to accept people for who they are. Language can help to make us more accepting, but how we chose to wield it is another matter.",

Being able to communicate with an individual from another country directly without a language barrier would mean that everyone speaks, understand and relates the same way. This would lead to fewer misunderstandings and disputes, resulting in less tension between countries and their people.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several disadvantages that come with having a universal language. First and foremost, language is an essential part of culture, and having one universal language would mean losing the language diversity that makes up our cultural identities. It would also risk losing the richness that comes with different languages, which encompass the diversity of meanings, grammar, literature, and culture.\n\nSecondly, it would lead to the eradication of dying languages, which would ultimately lead to a loss of language and historical knowledge. The linguistic diversity that exists in the world today is a source of pride, worth preserving to maintain the unique identity that each people bring.\n\nThirdly, establishing a universal language could result in the imposition of a language that would not suit everyone. This may mean that some cultures and people may feel marginalized, and their voices unheard. Thus, the language barrier would be replaced by a dominance of a single language over the rest of the languages spoken across the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is currently facing challenges caused by language barriers that have led to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and conflicts among nations. A universal language would be a significant step towards a global community, eliminating language barriers and facilitating better communication, economic prosperity and less tension among people from different countries.

Therefore, a common language would not be able to eliminate such negative behaviours. Instead, understanding and empathy towards different cultures and languages would help to foster respect towards each other in society. This can be achieved through active promotion of cultural exchange programs that encourage individuals to learn about and perceive different cultures positively. By embracing the diversity of languages, society can create a stronger foundation where individuals can learn and grow together without fear or prejudice.\nIn conclusion, languages are a vital aspect in shaping an individual's cultural identity and preserving diversity.

Being able to speak multiple languages allows individuals to communicate and develop a deeper understanding of different cultures, fostering empathy and mutual respect. Additionally, being multilingual is an important skill in today's globalised world as it opens up numerous opportunities to work with people from different parts of the world and build international relationships.

Language is just one example of this, and there will always be other ways to differentiate ourselves even if we had a single language. Furthermore, language has already been used as a tool for discrimination and prejudice. For instance, people in power have often used language to suppress minority groups by imposing their own language on them. This is evident in historical cases such as the imposition of French in Algeria by the French colonizers. If a common language were to be imposed on everyone, it would create an unfair advantage that would lead to further inequality rather than reducing it.\nIn conclusion, language is an essential part of our identity and it helps to promote diversity and creativity in society. Embracing and appreciating the diversity of languages will lead to better communication and understanding between people from different cultures. Having a single language may result in homogeneity and a reduction in creativity. Historically, language has also been used as a tool to create discrimination and prejudice.

This would be detrimental to different cultures and may cause the loss of valuable information, which is encoded in many minority languages. Thus, it is essential to invest in the preservation of these minority languages. For instance, UNESCO promotes the preservation of endangered languages around the world. This helps to conserve the cultural diversity that humanity possesses, thereby enriching our understanding and appreciation of different cultures.\nIn conclusion, having a common language may seem like a solution for eliminating communication barriers, but it is not a panacea for the world's problems. Language is an integral part of our culture and identity. It helps to promote diversity and understanding among people of different backgrounds.

This would only increase the divide between people, and make it harder to build bridges between different cultures and ethnicities. In the present-day context, it is worth noting that most societies are already multilingual and multicultural, and it is the co-existence of multiple languages that promotes the spirit of tolerance and acceptance, thus making the world a better place.\nIn conclusion, while having a common language may create a sense of unity, it would also destroy the beauty and richness that comes from speaking multiple languages. The existence of multiple languages helps to promote diversity and encourages people to embrace their own cultures and traditions. Therefore, let us appreciate and celebrate the linguistic diversity in the world, and work towards creating a society where people of all races and cultures can live harmoniously, while still being able to retain their unique identities.",

Hence, it would be naive to suggest that a common language would solve these issues.\nIn conclusion, although a common language may appear to be a solution to the world's communication problems, it is not the ultimate solution. The diversity of languages in society is a feature that should be celebrated and embraced. It promotes creativity, diversity, and understanding amongst people.

This could lead to language loss and cultural erasure, something that the world can ill afford.\nIn conclusion, a common language is not necessarily the solution to global peace and unity.

In fact, it is often these differences that make communication interesting and varied.\nUltimately, having a common language may seem like a good idea on the surface, but it would not necessarily bring about the kind of unity and understanding that we hope for. However, by embracing linguistic diversity, we can learn to appreciate and value the differences amongst us, and strive to build bridges across cultures, and understand more about the world around us.

This is especially true for languages spoken by minority groups who may feel threatened by the dominance of a single language. Thus, it is crucial to preserve and maintain the diversity of languages in our society.\nIn conclusion, while having a common language may seem like an attractive solution to eliminating communication barriers, it would ultimately do more harm than good. The diversity of languages that we have today plays a crucial role in shaping our cultures, promoting creativity and understanding.

It is not uncommon to see quiet, desolate playgrounds in Singapore nowadays, for many children prefer to retire to the comfort of playing with an iPad in an air-conditioned room indoors. Even on public transport, the ever-familiar sight of commuters with earphones plugged in and staring at a glaring smartphone screen never fails to greet passengers daily. Evidently, the fast pace of life has compromised on flourishing social relationships and promoted a society of hermits instead.\nFurthermore, the negative impacts that a fast pace of life has on our mental and physical health are far from negligible. Owing largely to the increased usage of devices and time spent looking at monitors, Singapore sees an outrageously high rate of myopia; we hold the unfortunate title of being world number 1 for the prevalence of myopia in seven to nine-year-olds. Additionally, the rise in the number of fast-food outlets in Singapore such as the popular McDonald'sor Burger King is indubitably a result of Singaporean'sgreater desire for a quick and efficient meal as they hurry to get back to work. These days, many see meals simply as a necessary chore to replenish their energy, rather than something that should be leisurely enjoyed. Such an unhealthy diet contributes to the 1.7 million people in Singapore at risk of obesity-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, and especially in explaining the dramatic rise in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes in recent years. Hence, it is evident that a fast pace of life has worsened the physical health of Singaporeans in more than one aspect. Moreover, the intense work culture is a key factor in explaining the reduced time spent on recreation or leisure activities, causing high-stress levels. People hardly give themselves sufficient time to rest and relax, trying their best to meet exorbitant workloads. According to the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore has seen large increases in cases of depression and anxiety in youths and young adults. Therefore, the decline in health levels of Singaporeans stands as strong evidence for the stand that the pace of life is indeed too fast in Singapore.\nTo end, although I acknowledge that their benefits reaped from economic progress is significant and desirable to all, the ramifications with which a fast pace of life brings to Singaporeans are severe and deep-rooted in their impact. Since Singapore is currently enjoying stable economic growth and progress, I propose that the government take more measures to ensure that the pace of life in Singapore is not too fast in order to prevent trends of declining, increasing stress levels, and ungraciousness are stemmed in the long run. Having said that, one must seek to achieve a balance between tangible and intangible comforts \u2013 in order to achieve, individuals should also seek to review their priorities and adjust their respective pace of life accordingly so as to ensure that it is not too fast and to the detriment of our overall well-being.",

This not only affects productivity in the workforce but also has a significant impact on the individual's mental and emotional well-being.\n\nMoreover, the fast pace of life in Singapore has also led to a decline in the quality of social relationships. As Singaporeans prioritize work and professional success, they tend to neglect their family, friends, and personal relationships. Many individuals find themselves making appointments with friends weeks in advance or struggling to find time to meet their loved ones. This has led to a growing concern about the social well-being and mental health of Singaporeans.\n\nAdditionally, the fast pace of life in Singapore has led to a rise in consumerism. Singaporeans are consistently bombarded with advertisements and promotions, encouraging them to purchase more and consume excessively. In a fast-paced society, material possessions have become a symbol of success and social status, leading to an unhealthy obsession with materialism and consumerism. This culture of consumerism has led to the depletion of natural resources and an increase in waste production.\n\nIn conclusion, the pace of life in Singapore is too fast for its own good. While the fast pace of life brings about many advantages such as efficiency, productivity, and convenience, it also results in negative consequences such as increased stress levels, a decline in quality social relationships, and a rise in consumerism. Thus, it is essential for the government and individuals to take a step back and reevaluate their priorities and values, to strike a balance between work and personal life, and to promote sustainable living and well-being. Only then can Singapore continue to develop as a prosperous and sustainable city-state, while providing a high quality of life for its citizens.",

This can lead to a blurring of boundaries between work and personal life, ultimately resulting in Singaporeans experiencing lower levels of happiness. Furthermore, the pandemic has amplified the need for us to stay at home, with virtual work and additional responsibilities, such as home-schooling for parents. Such stress and anxiety might spiral into burnout, which compromises our mental and physical well-being. It is apparent that a fast pace of life in Singapore has its merits, but it comes with a steep price in terms of stress and anxiety. Additionally, other factors like the price of living in a metropolis like Singapore does not help dispel these issues either making it even more difficult to cope with the fast pace of life.\nAs such, I advocate for a recalibration of the balance between efficiency and sustainable living in Singapore's society. It is only with extensive debate and discussion that we can seek to achieve a pragmatic middle ground that balances the needs of economic development with the well-being of its citizens. Perhaps measures like encouraging work-life balance, providing greater support for mental health, as well as implementing systems that will allow individuals to disconnect from work when they are off the clock. Initiatives like these will help compensate for the negative ramifications of the fast pace of life in Singapore. If Singapore's society can strike this balance, we can marry the best of advanced efficiency with sustainable living, thus realising Singapore's potential as a compassionate and capable society, efficient and interconnected, but not at the cost of its people.",
                "ing, email and video conferencing were initially perceived as tools that would improve communication and enable people to connect with each other better even over great distances. However, the opposite effect has been observed over time, as these technologies have become prevalent and ubiquitous as essential tools in our daily lives. Instead, individuals today face the challenge of maintaining healthy social relationships amidst the hustle and bustle of daily life, as work and productivity demands increasingly consume large portions of the day, leaving little time for family, friends and leisure.\nIn addition, the fast pace of life in Singapore has also resulted in a significant rise in the number of health issues faced by its populace. The pressure to constantly perform and deliver high levels of productivity has led to a culture of overworking without proper rest and relaxation. As such, individuals face high levels of stress, which in turn results in heightened risks of health problems that include mental illnesses, heart problems and other chronic ailments.\nMoreover, the fast pace of life in Singapore has also contributed to a decline in graciousness and common courtesy amongst Singaporeans. As individuals become more focused on their own goals and achievements, often at the expense of others around them, social etiquette and respectful behaviour towards others have taken a backseat. The case in point is the notorious reputation that Singapore has earned, as a country characterized by \u201ckiasuism\u201d where a person's actions are driven primarily by a fierce sense of competition and fear of missing out.\nIn conclusion, while the efficiency and productivity that come with a fast pace of life undoubtedly provide many benefits to the Singaporean society, it is crucial that we do not overlook the growing social, health and graciousness issues that plague our people. Therefore, we should strive to maintain a balance between productivity and quality of life, by recognizing the importance of social relationships, rest and relaxation, good health, and respect for others.",
                "ing apps and social media platforms have made it easier for people to communicate with one another, but ironically, it has not improved the quality of our communication. Many Singaporeans today struggle with finding the time to maintain meaningful connections with loved ones, as our fast pace of life has made it difficult to carve out time for socialisation. This often leads to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which can have detrimental effects on mental and emotional well-being. A 2018 study even showed that Singaporeans are the second-most sleep-deprived people in the world, with many attributing their lack of rest to work-related stress and anxiety, leading to a slew of physical and mental health problems. Hence, I strongly believe that the pace of life in Singapore is indeed too fast for its own good, as it affects not just the productivity of its citizens, but their sense of contentment and satisfaction with life as well.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that a fast pace of life can be necessary to compete in today's globalised economy, it is important for Singapore to strike a balance between economic progress and the well-being of its citizens. Singapore could consider implementing measures such as mandatory work-life balance quotas, flexible work arrangements, and affordable healthcare services to ease the burden on its workforce, and encourage a supportive society where individuals can pursue their aspirations without fear of being burnt out. Ultimately, Singaporeans deserve to live in a society that values not just efficiency, but also their holistic well-being.",
                "ing and streaming services have undoubtedly hastened the pace of Singaporean life. Some studies show that the average Singaporean works around 45 hours a week, experiences high levels of stress, and gets insufficient sleep. This frenetic pace of life takes a toll on individuals, leading to widespread exhaustion, burnout and poor mental health, which eventually spill over into other areas of life, such as the familial domain. In fact, many Singaporeans often lament that they have little time for their families or loved ones, with the weekends providing only a brief respite from the hustle and bustle of the working week. This has led to a decline in the graciousness and friendly nature of Singaporeans, which is reflected in the recent ratings where Singapore was ranked low for kindness and warmth. \nTo add on to this, the fast-paced nature of life in Singapore has also led to an overwhelming sense of materialism and competitiveness. The rush to attain financial success and social recognition often comes at the expense of simple joys in life and a sense of community, resulting in a population that is inward-looking, self-centred, and less likely to volunteer for the greater community. This is a worrying trend and goes against Singapore's core values of collectivism and social resilience. More than statistics and economic indicators, the true indication of Singapore's well-being and progress should be its social capital and the well-being of its people.\nIn conclusion, while the current pace of life in Singapore has certainly contributed to impressive economic results, Singapore should take a step back from the rat race to examine if the benefits outweigh the costs. Its people have much more to offer than a single-minded emphasis on productivity and efficiency.  By prioritising well-being, graciousness and social connectedness, Singapore can become a truly exemplary nation in the global community.",

However, while these have made communication and information-sharing more accessible, the fast pace of life required to keep up with these technological advancements has taken a toll on personal relationships, such as within families and between friends. This hyper-connectivity has meant that people are no longer fully present in the moment with their loved ones, as they are constantly checking their phones for work emails or scrolling through social media, losing the ability to truly bond and connect with others around them. The increase in workplace productivity and competitiveness has also meant that people are working longer hours, leading to a decrease in time spent with family and friends and a lack of a proper work-life balance, ultimately causing increased levels of stress and burnout.\nFurthermore, the fast pace of life in Singapore has led to a decline in graciousness and social civility among its citizens. In the rush to get things done quickly and efficiently, people have become more impatient and less tolerant of each other's mistakes or quirks. The lack of empathy and kindness that arises from this focus on productivity and efficiency has ultimately led to a cold, unwelcoming and unfriendly society. This lack of graciousness ultimately affects our national identity as Singaporeans, with foreign visitors unlikely to say that Singapore is a welcoming nation. This is problematic for a country that relies heavily on tourism, business, and friendly diplomatic relations.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the fast pace of life in Singapore has led to desirable economic results, we need to take into account the negative effects of this fast pace and question whether the benefits outweigh the costs. It is imperative that we strike a balance between productivity and graciousness, as well as to recognise that social civility and empathy are equally important in building a cohesive, sustainable and united society.",

A fast pace of life has led to a shortage of time for face-to-face interactions with loved ones and a lack of true bonding moments between family members. Instead, social interactions are increasingly superficial, and private quality moments are often interjected by the incessant buzzing of our devices. Greater stress levels have also been observed in Singaporeans, with the rise in the number of cases of mental illnesses like anxiety and depression. While high living standards enable basic material comforts, it is important to acknowledge that the costs that come with such a fast-paced lifestyle pale in comparison with the diminishing state of our social ties, mental health and well-being.\nIn conclusion, while it might be true that the pace of life in Singapore appears ideal in terms of economic productivity and competitive edge, it has led to adverse effects on Singaporeans and their social lives. We have to be mindful of its trade-offs, especially the consequences of a lack of social intimacy with loved ones and of high stress levels. As a society, it is therefore essential that we strike a balance between the urgency of keeping up with global standards while at the same time not neglecting the importance of aspects of lives, which have long been values of Singapore as past generations. We have to take a larger view, and keep in mind the importance of individual well-being, happiness, and work-life balance as important pursuit in our national discourse.",

It is not uncommon to see Singaporeans glued to their phones while travelling on public transport or during meal times, instead of engaging in face-to-face communication with their friends, family, or even strangers. This trend is extremely alarming as it has resulted in an erosion of graciousness and basic empathy for one another. Moreover, the fast pace of life has also led to increasing levels of stress and anxiety, which is especially prevalent in the younger individuals who are busy juggling their studies, extracurricular activities, and part-time jobs. A survey conducted by the Health Promotion Board found that between 18 to 34 years of age, the rates of depression and anxiety had risen over the years, with 1 in 4 seriously considering suicide. Clearly, the fast pace of life in Singapore is having serious negative ramifications on the wellbeing of Singaporeans, and this is something that we cannot turn a blind eye to and should be prioritized alongside economic prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be expedient to sustain the fast pace of life in Singapore due to its economic benefits, we must not lose sight of the negative social and health consequences it brings with it. In order to facilitate a healthy and gracious society, it is imperative that Singapore adopts a more holistic approach, one that prioritizes both economic development and societal wellbeing.",

With everyone constantly on-the-go, there is less time for face-to-face communication and interaction, which are crucial components of building and preserving relationships. The constant pressure to perform at one\u2019s best and keep up with the fast pace of life may also lead to overscheduling, causing Singaporeans to devote less time to personal or family obligations. As we continue to prioritise efficiency over everything else, the pace of life in Singapore ignores the important values of patience, kindness, empathy and social connectedness when dealing with others.\nAdditionally, there is no doubt that the fast pace of life in Singapore has taken a toll on the mental wellbeing of its people. The pressure to meet the demands of everyday life in order to maintain one\u2019s standard of living can be incredibly stressful. Coupled with the high cost of living, long working hours, and limited time for leisure, Singaporeans are arguably left with little time to unwind, causing a spike in stress levels. A person's mental health, given its intangible nature, is often neglected and dismissed as a concern thatcannot be easily remedied. However, the consequences of such neglect and dismissal can have long-lasting effects on individuals, with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety, and burnout becoming increasingly prevalent in Singaporeans.\nIn conclusion, while the increased emphasis on efficiency and productivity has been beneficial for Singapore in many ways, the pace of life in Singapore is undoubtedly too fast for its own good when it comes to the health and wellbeing of its people and the quality of social relationships. It is important to remember that Singapore's people are its most valuable resource, and to undervalue their wellbeing in pursuit of economic growth would ultimately be self-defeating. It is therefore incumbent upon society as a whole to make a conscious effort to manage the pace of life in a manner that prioritises not only economic growth, but also the wellbeing of its residents, ensuring that a balance is struck between productivity and quality of life.",

While this trend in speedy connection has its benefits, it has also meant that we have become accustomed to expecting instantaneous communication with others, and we tend to overlook the importance of slowing down and giving personal care and attention to our loved ones. The young and elderly alike have become susceptible to the allure of their screens, leading to decreasing face-to-face interaction and physical touch. This has significantly impacted the mental and emotional well-being of many Singaporeans, leading to feelings of loneliness, depression, and anxiety. The fast pace of life has also contributed to the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases among Singaporeans, including diabetes, hypertension, and obesity, as people\u2019s dietary habits and physical activity levels are compromised due to time constraints.\nFurthermore, the fast-paced nature of life in Singapore has catapulted stress levels to dangerous levels. In the rush to attain economic success and fulfil family obligations, Singaporeans are more prone to ignoring their own physical and mental health. Often, their well-being becomes secondary to the demands of work and family, leading to burnout and exhaustion. A study by job search portal CareerBuilder in 2017 showed that over half of Singaporeans feel that work stress has negatively impacted their personal relationships and physical health. This is a worrying trend for the nation, as it highlights the need to lower the pace of life and reclaim some semblance of work-life balance.\nIn conclusion, while it is important for Singapore to maintain its competitive edge by striving for greater efficiency and productivity, it must also take into account the ramifications of such a fast pace of life on the graciousness, health and stress levels of its people. It is only by acknowledging the negative impacts of this lifestyle, that we can put measures in place to promote a more balanced and well-lived life for all Singaporeans.

This has inevitably led to the erosion of relationships with spouses, parents and children, causing Singapore to have one of the world's lowest birth rates, and in turn widening the gap between older and younger Singaporeans. The pace of life in Singapore is too fast, as it often results in the sacrificing of social and familial ties, leading to a fractured society that has to deal with the social ramifications of a society where people are too high-strung or preoccupied to spend time with loved ones.\nFurther, the fast pace of life could be taking a heavy toll on the health of Singaporeans. With minimal time to exercise and constant exposure to the intense competitive mentality so pervasive in our society, Singaporeans are increasingly becoming more stressed and less happy, leading to an increased risk of physical and mental health issues. With chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease, becoming more widespread Singapore, it is high time that we slow our pace of life down to strike a better balance between work and recreational activities. The resulting benefits of this would not only be wealthier but also healthier, with enough time for family, friends and leisure activities.\nIn conclusion, the current pace of life in Singapore is too fast for its people. While it is true that the emphasis on efficiency and productivity has led to Singapore becoming a wealthy and renowned city-state, the trade-offs it has resulted in, such as fractured relationships and poor health, make the current approach unsustainable.

For many, if they receive awards, not only are they put in the spotlight, but the hard work they put in to achieve what they did is thoroughly recognised. When Michael Phelps achieved the award of having the most number of gold medals in the history of the Olympics, he became both a legend and an icon. He could immediately retire as a result, travel the world, and still make money to lead a comfortable life with his title of most prized Olympian. Similarly, Usain Bolt's100-metre record made him the target of the advertising teams of most successful sports brands and led to the creation of a line of sport shoes attached to his name. His signature \"lightning\" pose became a highly impersonated pose by athletes around the world and he continues to inspire many others with his talent and personality. Prizes and awards are thus useful in helping artists and athletes boost their outreach and their careers away from their sports and their main lines of work. They allow athletes to establish fan bases, providing them with the validation and recognition they need. Prize and award ceremonies are also commonly screened live with millions of viewers watching, allowing them to have a great impact on not only the celebrities and athletes but their audience as well.\nHowever, prizes and awards may also in turn create a materialistic society in which the prizes and awards are sought instead of the achievement and recognition that come from them. Individuals might as a result only be willing to contribute to society for something in return, and may even resort to underhanded means to achieve what they want, opening prize and award systems to abuse. According to a 2008 scientific record, published retractions in scientific journals have increased around 1,200% over the past decade, even though the number of published papers has gone up by only 44%. Around half of these retractions are suspected cases of misconduct. Furthermore, scientists may only focus on populist domains in which there are prizes to be won, instead of domains of research that might benefit minority communities greatly, or even hidden discoveries that may benefit society greatly. Similarly, sportsmen may lose sight of the true meaning of sportsmanship in the pursuit of these awards. Lance Armstrong, a former legend was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after being found guilty of using steroids to improve his performance during the races. Excessive competition and emphasis of prizes and awards might result in individuals disregarding things achievements that might not come with rewards, causing society to evolve into one that is only individualistic, and focused on material self-interests.\nAs Jake Colsen once said, \"The ones who win usually don\"t need a prize.\" Though prizes and awards are undoubtedly valued in our society, it is important more so for us to be able to see beyond these material accolades of our achievements.

This can be particularly true for students who may engage in unethical practices like cheating or cutting corners to win academic prizes.\n\nAnother criticism is that awards and prizes can be limited in their scope. For example, awards for academic excellence are often based on standardized tests that fail to measure holistic abilities such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Similarly, art competitions can often be judged based on subjective criteria rather than objective merit, leaving some artists feeling overlooked and undervalued.\n\nIn conclusion, awards and prizes serve a useful purpose as a way to recognize and reward outstanding achievements and contributions. They motivate individuals to strive for excellence, boost morale, and provide public acknowledgment. While there may be criticisms of awards and prizes, it is important to remember that they are not an end in themselves but rather a means of recognizing and promoting excellence in various fields. We should celebrate the individuals who win these awards while also acknowledging the importance of collaboration and community in achieving excellence.",

The Academy Awards or Oscars are an example of this, where actors and filmmakers who have accomplished exceptional work are recognised by the industry and society. Winning this award puts the individual on a pedestal, making them role models and inspiring the next generation of actors and filmmakers. In sports, awards like the Ballon d'Or, Olympic medals or World Cup trophies are the ultimate rewards for athletes who have trained for years honing their skills. These accolades prove to be sources of inspiration and motivation for future athletes who dream of success in their respective sporting endeavours. On a smaller scale, awards given by local schools and organisations to top achievers at academic or sports events motivate students, encourage healthy competition, and inspire others to work hard and aim higher.\n\nHowever, prizes and awards should not solely be the end goal of someone's hard work. An overemphasis on the physical rewards of winning can lead individuals to become overly competitive and materialistic. The focus on the end goal may lead individuals to overlook the importance of the process of hard work and the development of skills required to achieve their goals. Moreover, it may lead to an overemphasis on winning at all costs, as opposed to emphasising the importance of character and values.\n\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards are effective in recognising the excellence of individuals and groups in their respective fields. They provide motivation for individuals to strive for excellence and serve as inspiration to others. However, an overemphasis on the physical rewards of winning may lead to a society that is too focused on material success. Therefore, while prizes and awards are useful tools in acknowledging achievement, it is vital to emphasise the importance of the journey towards achieving our goals and the development of character and values.",
                "desire to excel. Athletes who win medals, awards, and trophies are well-respected and serve as role models for others who aspire to excel in their respective disciplines. For instance, the Olympics is a global event that epitomizes the importance of awards and prizes in sports, creating an atmosphere of competition that is motivating and inspiring to all those who participate. Similarly, in the entertainment industry, awards such as the Grammy's, Academy Awards, and BAFTA Awards help recognize artistes and their work, thereby elevating the level of excellence in their art form. Award winners become models for upcoming artistes, and their stories serve as sources of inspiration for others to follow.\nHowever, an excessive focus on awards and prizes can also have negative consequences. This excessive focus could create a society where individuals are solely focused on monetary benefits and award recognition, leading to a race for the \"prize\". People would be more incentivized to take up professions that offer greater monetary rewards, neglecting fields that may not offer the same rewards, but may still be essential for the betterment of society. This may also lead to individuals cheating or taking unethical measuresto win prizes, monetary as well as non-monetary, thus defeating the essence of the awards.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards are an effective tool of recognition and incentivisation that motivate individuals to work hard and strive for excellence. Prizes help recognize individuals for their achievements, inspire others to perform better in their respective fields, and further incentivize young people to pursue their passions. However, an over-emphasis on prizes and material rewards can have the negative effect of limiting people's career choices, leading to a cohort of young people solely driven by material desires. A balance between recognition and overemphasis on prizes is essential. The saying \"Keep your eyes on the prize\" is not as relevant if what we seek is the joy and satisfaction of the journey.",

For example, the Oscars and the Emmys recognise the best in the film and television industry, and this recognition has been used to inspire and motivate upcoming filmmakers and actors to strive for excellence. Similarly, the Olympic games encourage athletes to aim to be the best in their sports, by giving them a chance at fame and acknowledgement, not just from their country but from the entire world. This recognition instils a feeling of pride in the individual, making them feel valued and boosting their morale; it motivates the individual to continue pushing the boundaries of their capabilities.\nHowever, this prominence of prizes and awards can also be counterproductive, promoting a culture of excessive consumerism and materialism. It can lead people to obsess over his or her own achievements, rather than focusing on their work and the betterment of society. They can even create a sense of entitlement with individuals only striving for the prize money or fame, rather than for the sake of achievement itself, it's an inversion of the original purpose. Awards and prizes can also inspire a sense of rivalry or competition, resulting in individuals prioritising their own recognition rather than genuine collaboration, which hinders real progress.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards serve as recognition for the efforts and achievements of accomplished individuals, encouraging them to continue striving for excellence. The recognition and accolades motivate individuals to scale new heights and push their boundaries. However, the primary purpose of pursuing knowledge for its own sake sometimes appears to be lost in our cacophony of obsession with awards and recognition, and we are limiting ourselves in the long run as a result.

Winning an award or prize make the recipients role models for others in the same field. This motivation can lead to others emulating their actions, duplicating success in order to get the same recognition as their idols and being inspired by those who have achieved excellence to become great themselves.\nWe must also bear in mind that prizes and awards aren't everything. People become too focused or obsessed with the winning mentality that it detracts from their main aim to do something meaningful. If people work towards prizes for the wrong reasons, hoping to gain fame or financial gain instead of genuine passion for their field or making a sincere contribution to society, it can lead to a culture of unhealthy competition and materialism. Unfortunately, such issues are currently being experienced in areas such as academia and sports, where people are so focused on winning and achieving awards that they tend to lose sight of the bigger picture.  Consequently, instead of striving for the greater good, individuals end up placing the pursuit of fame or recognition above the actual purpose and meaning of their work.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards can have both positive and negative impacts, but overall they offer a great incentive and reward system, motivating individuals to strive for excellence and inspiring others to follow in their footsteps. While it is important to recognise the achievements of individuals, it must be done in a healthy and balanced manner. The focus must be on genuine passion and contributing to society, rather than the materialistic pursuit of prizes and awards, and achieving excellence must be valued for the greater good rather than merely personal gain.",

In sports, the prestigious Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year awards serve as a motivation to football players worldwide who dedicate their lives to the sport at an elite level, opening doors to crucial sponsorships and contracts with major clubs. Moreover, the phenomenon of award ceremonies and red-carpet events popularised by celebrities and their fan base can certainly inspire impressionable youngsters worldwide, who might aspire to achieve similar feats, therefore, the recognition that accompanies prizes and awards motivates individuals to strive for excellence in their respective fields, encouraging and showcasing to society, the importance of hard work, dedication and perseverance to achieve their goals.\nHowever, we must ensure not to over-value awards and prizes, as that could lead to materialism and cause us to lose sight of what really matters. While awards and prizes are essential motivations for aspiring individuals and groups, there must still be a balance and recognition for those who work hard simply due to passion for their field, without any expectation of monetary or societal gain. Moreover, focusing too much on winning a prize award may lead to those who do not win to be discouraged and lose motivation, especially in a society where recognition is highly valued. Thus, it is crucial to ensure that there is recognition and reward for all individuals who work hard, as it creates an inclusive society that promotes equal opportunities for everyone, regardless of socio-economic status or achievements.\nTo conclude, prizes and awards are vital components in a society that emphasises meritocracy and determination. They play a prominent role in recognising the achievement of individuals and groups in various fields from science, sports, politics to arts, while motivating individuals to strive harder towards their dreams. Nonetheless, we should ensure that their importance is balanced to not create a materialistic and uneven society, in which recognition and rewards become the sole driver for achievement.

The awards elevate movies to a new level, influencing people's opinions and driving more revenue for the industry. Similarly, the Olympic games are well-known for their medal ceremonies, with gold medals considered the highest honour an athlete can receive. These medals go beyond the glossy hardware, symbolising an athlete's relentless pursuit of perfection, and inspiring others to push their limits as well. Prizes and awards in these fields allow one to gain a sense of accomplishment. It is incredibly important to recognise individuals who have exceptionally achieved and reward them for their efforts, as it drives society to attain higher levels of excellence.\n\nHowever, there is a flip-side of awards when people put all their focus solely on winning the prize, rather than the process of achieving the prize itself. This can lead to a culture of materialism and encourage people to focus too much on their 'invisible budgets', increasing inequality. When a society becomes too fixated on receiving accolades often, it can lead to a distorted outcome where less important ideals and goals are overlooked, in favour of acquiring a more significant prize. Therefore, we must ensure that we do not become so fixated upon receiving recognition that we forget about the joy of the learning process itself and self-improvement. \n\nIn conclusion, awards and prizes are excellent, incentivising tools as they motivate people to strive to achieve more in their respective disciplines. These awards recognise outstanding people within society and influence society itself positively.

This serves as a critical tool in the development of future generations, as they strive to attain recognition, pushing them to work harder, subsequently resulting in greater achievements and advancements in society.\nYet, despite these benefits, the over-valuation of awards and prizes can create an over materialistic society wherein everything people do is based solely on the possibility of obtaining a reward. This can result in a mindset which sees individuals only as a means to an end, a tool rather than a living human being with emotions and needs. As a result, the value of human life is reduced to that of a 'prize', and people may then go to inhuman lengths to fulfil their ambitions in pursuit of accolades and rewards.

These awards give musicians and actors recognition for their hard work, and allow for them to gain more opportunities in their respective fields as a result. For example, a Grammy award could lead to more record sales, and an Academy award could lead to more lucrative acting roles, all of which are major boosts to a career. Similarly, in sports, being recognised as a Most Valuable Player or receiving a gold medal at the Olympics are also major sources of pride and recognition.

Such recognition not only motivates athletes to train harder, but also motivates the younger generation to follow in their footsteps.\nHowever, as stated earlier, we must also recognise the potential negative impacts of an over-valuation of awards and prizes. With too much emphasis placed on winning prizes, competition can become more about winning than enjoying the process of learning and growing. People might lose sight of the intrinsic value of the skills and knowledge they are cultivating and focus solely on the external validation that comes with winning a prize. This can create a society that is materialistic in nature, with individuals only seeking monetary rewards rather than fulfilling their passions in life. Therefore, while recognising outstanding people is important, it is equally important to understand that there are merits beyond the prizes and awards themselves, such as intrinsic satisfaction and thirst for knowledge.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards serve as a testament to human excellence and the contribution of individuals to society. With recognition and rewards, people can be motivated to strive for excellence in diverse fields, leading to increased innovation and productivity. At the same time, we need to be aware that overvaluing prizes can lead to a materialistic society that focuses solely on winning and diminishes the intrinsic value of learning and growth.

The winner's work is widely acclaimed and celebrated throughout the industry and beyond, inspiring both their fans and upcoming actors to work hard towards being recognized in that field. Another example is the Nobel Peace Prize, which is awarded to people who have made substantial contributions towards creating a peaceful world. Winning the Nobel Peace Prize is a recognition of exceptional work that inspires and motivates the rest of the world to work towards a peaceful world in their own ways. Beyond the financial reward, being recognized for their achievements could be seen as a form of motivation to continue doing what they do best, for the betterment of humanity and to further inspire those around them.\nHowever, we need to acknowledge the potential pitfalls of the excessive focus on \"winning prizes\" and distorting the goals of the individual. An excessive focus on awards and prizes can lead to recognition and rewards being reduced to a mere status symbol, and a lack of recognition leading to low morale or a complete loss of motivation, particularly for those who fail to achieve recognition. This especially applies to young and impressionable individuals in whom a winning culture might generate a mental block with respect to enjoying their journey of learning or excelling in their field. Thus, prizes and awards should not be seen as the only source of motivation, nor should they be the end goal. Rather, it should be used as a tool to recognize exceptional talent while not belittling the efforts of others working towards the same goal.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards are valuable when used to recognize and reward individuals for their exceptional work and talent. They positively impact the individuals and encourage them to continue working hard in their field, motivating others to follow in their footsteps. However, it is important to practice moderation in the value attributed to prizes and awards.

However, apart from his deep religious and moral beliefs, less appreciated and acknowledged is the courage of his convictions. King was nearly killed when he was stabbed by an assailant while on a book tour, and was arrested numerous times as he led marches and other demonstrations. He lived a great deal of his life in the face of ugly crowds, yet, King'sbeliefs and courage prevailed. It must be acknowledged that he was human, flawed and no doubt he was scared. However, his humanity never overcame his commitment to a higher purpose and in his own brave, nonviolent way, he showed courage. King'scourage gave others strength, and inspired many others to have the same goal of ending racial injustice. Therefore, this shows how moral courage can be expressed to end injustice, and is undoubtedly virtuous in fighting for positive change in society.\nHowever, we must also recognize that courage may not always be virtuous \u2013 it may bring about devastating consequences like the imposition on people'slives, destitution and military aggression. As seen in Adolf Hitler'sExpansionist Policy in WWII to set up his ideal world, he singlehandedly orchestrated the deaths of six million Jews during the Holocaust in the pursuit of his vision. His power was absolute and unchallenged, and showed courage and fierce determination in executing his plans. He was convicted in his desire for absolute power, even resorting to underhanded means for political ascension \u2013 he and his Gestapo (the German secret police) burnt down the Reichstag in order for Hitler to initiate a state of Emergency and seize both the power of the Chancellor and the President and install himself as the absolute dictator, the Fuhrer. It took courage for Hitler to pursue this dream for absolute dominion so relentlessly, especially in the face of such mounting global opposition and adversity. Despite the threat of military aggression against his country and the ultimate threat of a world war, he remained resolute. However, such a dream as he wished to be fulfilled was tainted and distorted, and as the saying goes, \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". In this instance, his courage was abused and brought unimaginable pain and suffering to vast numbers of people \u2013 such courage can never, in any sense, be considered virtuous.\nSimilarly, courage should not be regarded as a virtue when such courage is utilised to pursue what one thinks is the right course of action against general consensus and the greater good of all. Courage in this sense can be made manifest in one man'sassumed delusional struggle against the broader concerns of society, a self-initiated renegade cause that brings destruction and uncertainty in its wake. Such an example is of the parallels of both Doctor Stockmann from the play, \"Enemy of the People\", by Henrik Ibsen, and the true story of Erin Brockovich. In both cases, both Brockovich and Stockmann discovered discrepancies in the water supply that led them to deduce, with conviction, that the water sources were poisoned. Hence, they sought to challenge the authorities, albeit with insufficient evidence, compromising and jeopardising the livelihoods of many of whom had jobs dependent on the water supply and its management. Despite the evident repercussions their perception of the truth might have imposed on the innocents, they nevertheless went ahead with their quest for supposed justice, disregarding the injustice that they would exact on the people. Hence, in this sense, courage is seen as an instrument of a selfish quest for a personal belief, rather than an expression of a noble virtue.\nOscar Wilde quipped, \"Society does not exist, it is a mere concept. The real world consists of only individuals.\" This statement can be seen as true when we realize that there is no realistic standardisation and no coagulation of the separate individuals of society into one condensed body. Since courage is an instrument exacted and controlled by the individual, the perception of courage and the effects of courageous acts are bound to vary greatly as the individual lends a portion of his multi-dimensional character to the expression of courage. Hence there can be no clear-cut designation of courage as a pure virtue, as it does not exist in mono-dimensions. Courage can be positive, bestowing blessings upon others, and can be a virtue, or it can be a curse \u2013 depending on what objectives it lends itself to.",

Acting with courage does not necessarily absolve one of moral responsibility.\n\nCourage may also have different consequences for different people. For someone who is privileged and has a safety net, taking a risky action may be a smaller sacrifice than for someone who has more to lose. In this case, the idea of courage may be skewed and somewhat unachievable for those who do not have social or economic privilege. Courage may be considered a virtue for those who have access to support and resources to help them mitigate the risk of their actions.\n\nHowever, it is undeniable that there are situations where courage is necessary and even virtuous. For example, standing up for one's beliefs in the face of opposition or discrimination requires courage and can have a positive impact. People who use their courage to advocate for social issues like climate change or human rights often inspire others to take action as well. In situations where the stakes are high, courage can make a significant difference in one's ability to overcome adversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of courage is not simple or straightforward. While it is often considered to be a virtue, it is not always necessary or virtuous to act with courage in every situation. Rather, it is important to consider the context, consequences, and ethics of one's actions in deciding whether to act bravely. Courage, although admirable, cannot exist without a moral and ethical framework to guide it.",

He demonstrated moral courage by championing the cause of racial equality despite facing numerous threats to his life and the lives of his family members, leading the famous \"I Have a Dream\" speech and the Montgomery bus boycott. Through his determination and his refusal to give in to fear, Martin Luther King Jr. was able to effect change, bringing an end to segregation and discrimination. His courage and virtue in pursuing what was right and just have been admired for generations, and serve as an example of how one person's actions can change the world.\nIn conclusion, courage can be considered a virtue when it is exercised for good causes, such as external threats, individualism and moral justification. In the hands of the wrongdoer, courageous acts become folly. Despite this ambiguity, however, the positing of courageous acts is virtuous, with the examples of wartime and civil rights, art and humanitarian efforts all having a lasting impact on the world. Courage may not always enjoy the unimpeachable reputation of other virtues, but it remains an essential part of the human soul \u2013 without it, society would be far less diverse and dynamic.

King's courage and wisdom was an essential component in his fight for justice, and he remains an inspiration to this day for those who choose to stand up against injustice.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that courage can also be misguided, and can lead to negative outcomes. The idea of \"courage in the face of stupidity\" is one such example \u2013 when people act in defiance of common sense or logic, often to their own detriment. For example, someone who decides to climb to the top of a tall building without proper safety equipment as a way to prove their courage may be seen as foolish and their actions could lead to serious injury or even death. Similarly, someone who chooses to confront a dangerous criminal without proper training or preparation may put themselves and others at risk. In these cases, courage may be viewed not as a virtue, but as a liability \u2013 something that can be dangerous and counterproductive when not tempered by wisdom and forethought.\nIn conclusion, I believe that courage is certainly a virtue when it is used for the greater good, and when it is accompanied by knowledge, wisdom and good intentions. It can inspire positive change, empower others, and lead to achievements that might not have been possible otherwise. However, it is important to remember that courage must be used wisely, and that it can have negative consequences when not used responsibly.

Physical courage in the face of external threats, individualistic courage in the form of breaking conventions and moral courage in the pursuit of justice are all examples of virtuous courage.

            "human_gen_truncate": "many American students, deemed as a fixture in American consciousness for many decades due to its examination of racial injustice. This shows how novels are able to both educate students on the struggles faced by certain segments of society, as well as to model for students how they can stand up and speak out against injustice. This would undoubtedly improve one'ssocial skills in terms of how they empathise and how they relate to other individuals. Hence, this shows how works of fiction still hold an important place in society, in addressing pertinent issues in the world and empowering individuals to eradicate these problems.\nIn addition, a commonly cited reason that parents encourage children to read from a young age is that reading novels improves creativity. By reading more books, children would be able to expose themselves to new and more information. This would develop creativity in children, allowing them to come up with more innovative ideas. Through the interesting characters as well as creative story plots that are woven together intrinsically by authors, this develops a child'sability to think imaginatively. As compared to spending time playing video games and surfing the Internet, reading books is an activity that forces the reader to ditch distractions and focus. It is this said focus that acts as a catalyst for an increase in creativity. This is because books are a window to the world \u2013 allowing a glimpse into cultures past, present and future, as interpreted by their authors and filtered through our own imaginations. Children who read novels from a young age would be able to discover an amazing amount of information, especially at a young age when they are more impressionable. The more children know, the more they will be able to share, ultimately shaping them to become better conversationalists, quicker thinkers and better problem solvers in the future.\nHowever, just as with all things, novels do have a negative side to them that hold no value in bettering one'slife. In order for us to reap the benefits of reading novels, we as readers need to be selective in what we choose to read. There are close to 130 million books in the world, and it would be naive to assume that all novels hold an equal value to an individual. While there are novels that stimulate one'sintellect and improve creativity, there also exist novels that encourage morally unsound values. An example would be the genre of erotic novels. Novels such as \"Twilight\" by Stephenie Meyer, or E. L. Jame's\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" certainly would not hold any value in bettering one'slife. This is because these books do not focus on inculcating the right values in its readers, but instead promote the culture of pre-marital sex, which may not coincide with the values that readers have been taught. Hence, one would probably not gain any of the abovementioned benefits if one chooses to read books that are of no significant value.Thus, one can see that rather than generalize whether novels are a waste of time, it is far better to scrutinize each novel individually. Some novels tend to have more educational value; others, moral value, and it is up to readers to be discerning and seek out books of quality, not just chick-lit romance novels that teach us little and can be justified as \"a waste of time\" as the question suggests..

Apart from providing perspectives and inspiration to writers, they also provide educational value by providing knowledge and understanding of the world's history, cultures, and contemporary issues.

These novels act as mirrors that reflect the injustices that happen in society, such as discrimination and inequality, which is often overlooked in mainstream media. Through reading these novels, we are able to gain insight into issues that may be uncomfortable to discuss, and through that understanding we can then learn to empathize with others around us.\nFurthermore, novels provide a means for readers to develop their emotional intelligence. Reading novels is not just a passive activity but also an interactive one. It requires the reader to create a mental image of the setting, the characters and their emotions. Through this process, readers expand their imagination and empathy towards characters that may be vastly different from themselves. By stepping into the shoes of another character, readers are forced to think about how they would react to certain situations and what emotions they would feel, which is an important skill to have as it helps develop social and emotional intelligence.\nIn conclusion, it can be seen that reading novels is not merely a way of spending time, but is actually a valuable pursuit that provides a window into different worlds and experiences that can expand one's understanding of the world around them. Through stories, language, and themes, novels can inspire readers to see the world in new ways and challenge their previously held assumptions. Above all, novels provide us with the opportunity to develop our creativity, empathy, vocabulary, and emotional intelligence, all of which are vital skills to have in the modern world.

Escaping into another world, even if it is only for a short while, allows one to de-stress and unwind. It is a form of entertainment that is not as passive as binging on television shows, as the reader is actively engaged in the story and has to use their imagination to picture the different settings. According to a study published in the journal Brain Connectivity, reading fiction can improve connectivity between different regions in the brain and improve mental flexibility. By engaging with different characters and situations, readers can also learn to develop problem-solving skills and resilience, which can be applied in everyday life. \n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that novels are more than just a way of passing time or escaping reality. They are a source of inspiration for aspiring artists, a tool for learning about history and current societal issues, and a means of improving one's mental health and wellbeing. While there is merit in non-fictional works, it is crucial to recognize the value of the fictional stories that often hold valuable lessons for our personal growth and development.

This shows how values are equally as important as academic credentials in helping one secure a job, as well as to thrive in the workforce. Since the primary responsibility of schools is to prepare students for the workforce, they should also prepare students to deal with situations that will test their resilience and character in the future.\nIn addition, the goals of the education system globally are to meet the emotional needs and aid in the emotional development of the child as stated in Article 29 of the United Nations Charter on the Rights to an Education. This shows that governments and world leaders recognize the vital role that schools play in nurturing a child. Several countries have already put in place measures to help a child develop to his fullest potential by ensuring that the emotional needs are met by conducting programmes to teach children values and develop their character. In 2012, the Singapore government introduced the Edusave Character Award, and every year since it was introduced, rewards have been given to the students who have demonstrated excellent character and are role models for their peers. This further helps to emphasize the point that schools are not merely places to accrue knowledge, but are also places for holistic development. Some students view their teachers as \"second parents\" and do approach them for advice with difficulties they face beyond their academic work. Teachers, in this sense, are responsible for guiding their students in the right direction and urging them to make the best possible decisions in the future.\nHowever, some point out that the current education system is already over-laden with too many activities and programmes, and schools should not be made to bear the sole responsibility of imparting values to a child as well. Many would argue that it is the role of the parents to do so. I believe that parents do hold a great influence over their child and should work together with the schools in order to impart good values to their children. Teachers today already have much on their plate, to cope with not just teaching, but other administrative duties as well. Given they have so many students in one class to manage, it would also not be reasonable or realistic to expect a teacher to be responsible for so many students at a time. Moreover, parents are the main caregivers in a child'slife, and studies have shown that parents prove to have the most significant influence on shaping a child'sdevelopment and character in their growing years. Hence, parents should also be taking an active role in ensuring that students have sound morals.\nIn conclusion, schools should teach values as well as knowledge in order to complement what children learn at home and prepare them for future challenges. Certain scenarios that children encounter in school are similar to what one would expect in the workforce, albeit on a smaller scale and with fewer consequences. Teaching students how to cope with these challenges will go a long way in preparing them for the future and helping them reach their full potential.",

By incorporating values that engender compassion and empathy, students can better understand the feelings of people around them. For example, a student who is taught the value of \"care\" would be more likely to show concern for someone who is having a bad day. In this way, values encourage students to develop emotional intelligence, which is necessary to succeed in society.\n\nLastly, values provide a foundation for a well-rounded education. While knowledge is essential in professions like medicine, engineering, or law, values are just as important. Success in life does not necessarily depend on one's intellect alone but also on one's ability to interact with others and be a good team player. Simply put, values are crucial to personal growth and self-awareness.\n\nSome may argue that values should be taught at home instead of schools. While it is true that parents play the most significant role in molding their child's character, schools can reinforce the values taught at home. Schools provide a platform for a more comprehensive approach to teaching values. It exposes students to different perspectives, allows them to engage in debate and discussion, and teaches them that diverse opinions and beliefs are respected while building a moral compass that only they can adhere to.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that schools should not only teach knowledge but values as well. Integrating values into the curriculum encourages students to become responsible adults, fosters a sense of social responsibility, builds emotional intelligence, and creates a foundation for personal growth.

            "prompt": "HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE THAT MODERN LIFE IS PLAGUED BY FEAR AND INSECURITY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "fe of modern man. At the societal level, rapid urbanization has resulted in a much more stressful pace of life with high-rise living causing people to feel more and more isolated in an increasingly impersonal world. The rise of online communications may have made our lives more convenient, yet it has also created a yawning gap between virtual reality and \"real\", physical, human interaction. The social malaise can also be felt in institutions such as marriage which has become more tenuous: marriage is less and less viewed as a sacred union between two people but more and more as a contract that can now be easily and conveniently terminated. At the same time, what used to be condemned as sins or crimes \u2013 abortion, homosexuality, children born out of wedlock \u2013 are now perceived as manifestations of an alternative lifestyle. With moral values in a shifting state of perpetual flux, it is no wonder that in the modern world we live in today, we are faced with greater uncertainty in our social lives.\nYet, it would be a mistake to focus merely on the negative aspects of modern society that evoke fear and insecurity, while neglecting those areas of our modern world that offer us enhanced security and reassurance. One area where this can be seen is the increased ease of life facilitated by modernization, where higher standards of living are achieved through a combination of the technological advancements and economic growth that we experience in our modern society. No doubt these may also generate a measure of fear and insecurity as discussed above, however we must also acknowledge that the greater convenience and comfort they bring through improved facilities and amenities have contributed to the well-being of our modern life. At the same time, the increased connectivity that we experience in our modern world can also bring about a stronger sense of community \u2013 both in real life and online \u2013 which can translate into easier access to overcome life'sdifficulties through counselling services and support groups from all over the world. This can in turn lead to a greater sense of assurance and stability in today'sworld.\nMoreover, it can also be argued that a measure of fear and insecurity can be desirable in our modern world as this serves to make us more vigilant and take precautionary measures to alleviate future ills. For instance, in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami of 2004, fears of similar future devastation drove many governments to set up advanced tsunami warning systems in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which brought much assurance to peoples living in coastal areas in these regions. Another example was the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 which caused widespread global panic and fear, yet following this incident, governments and hospitals started to implement tighter quarantine and monitoring procedures. This consequently contributed to more stability and less panic amongst medical personnel and the public when similar viruses such as H1N1 and avian flu struck in the following years. Hence to a certain extent, it can be said that fear and insecurity in our modern society may not always be something to avoid or be plagued with.\nIn essence, there is no denying that our modern world contains much to be fearful and insecure about as the daily newspapers continue to herald new threats, unprecedented challenges and previously-undiscovered risks. Yet, as the title of a recent book \u2013 \"Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?\" \u2013 implies, we have to be careful not to be overly pessimistic of the world we live in, or else we may become paralyzed and plagued by fear to the point that we fail to appreciate there is also much in our modern world that provides us with joy, safety and security.",

This, in turn, can lead to societal problems such as xenophobia, racism, and prejudice.\n\nMoreover, fear and insecurity can harm the economy. When people are constantly worried about their safety and security, they are less likely to spend money on discretionary items, leading to a decrease in consumer spending. It can also lead to a decrease in travel and tourism, which could further damage the economy, as these industries contribute significantly to global GDP. \n\nIn light of this, it is imperative that we explore solutions to mitigate the negative impact of fear and insecurity. One way to do this is by increasing communication and transparency amongst authorities and citizens. By providing clear and concise information about potential threats and the measures being taken to counter them, authorities can reduce public panic and alleviate anxiety. Additionally, investing in technology that can prevent cybercrime and protect personal information can also help alleviate the fears of individuals.\n\nEducation about these different threats and how to protect oneself against them is also crucial. By teaching people how to take the necessary precautions and identify potential threats, they can feel more empowered to take control of their own security and therefore have reduced levels of fear and insecurity. In essence, increased information and preparedness can help equip people with the necessary tools to deal with and manage various risks, ultimately reducing feelings of panic and fear.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that modern life is, unfortunately, plagued by fear and insecurity. We have seen that the rise of terrorism, cybercrime, and economic instability has created a constant state of anxiety and fear in the minds of individuals. This has serious implications for on both individuals and society, including poor decision making and potentially xenophobic societal behaviour. Despite this, various steps can be taken to reduce these negative effects, including increased transparency and education. By taking these steps, we can hope to promote a more secure and confident society.",

We see this in the way we relate to our bodies \u2013 with the rise of \"no carb\" or \"gluten-free\" diets, organic or vegetarian food and the like, there is an increasing sense of fear over what we consume and how it might harm our health. People are scared of illnesses such as cancer, and there is a growing feeling that we need to constantly protect ourselves from various diseases. This is not unfounded \u2013 after all, the effects of industrialization and pollution have played their part in deteriorating the natural environment and our health. Increasing numbers of people are also turning to insurance policies and savings plans as a safeguard against future uncertainties. While it is certainly prudent to prepare for the unexpected, the increased focus on such precautionary measures also reflects a heightened sense of vulnerability and fear in our society.\nNevertheless, despite all of these fears and insecurities, I believe there are positive facets to modern life that offer support and stability. Firstly, the spread of information and knowledge through the internet and social media has allowed us to stay better informed about potential risks, making it easier to make responsible decisions about our lives both individually and collectively. Secondly, the existence of reliable institutions such as the police, the judiciary, and healthcare services provides us with a safety net of sorts and reassurance that irresponsible or malevolent behaviour will be punished and that we can receive precisely defined rights and benefits. Lastly, the support network of family, friends and community that many people still have provides a critical bulwark to fear and anxiety. These support networks that offer comfort and companionship often make the difference between being consumed by fear and weathering even the most difficult situations.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that fear and insecurity are prevalent in the modern era; however, the impact of these emotions on our lives should not be overstated. In the end, modern society is an inextricable blend of positive and negative elements, with the perceived risks often accompanied by benefits that we could not have imagined even a century ago. Yes, we should be cautious and make the necessary preparations for possible threats, but we should not let fear paralyze us to the point where we lose faith in our ability to overcome difficulties and make progress.",

From the stressful demands of work and school, to the constant bombardment of advertisements urging us to consume more products and services, it can feel like we live in a perpetual state of anxiety and worry. More significantly, there is also the sense of a loss of privacy and personal safety in the face of rising crime rates and growing societal unrest. The proliferation of social media and other communication technologies have made it easier than ever before for individuals to be targeted and victimized by online predators or physical assailants. The sense of insecurity and vulnerability that stems from these threats cannot be underestimated, and it is little wonder that so many people are increasingly living their lives in a state of fear and apprehension.\nDespite these pressing concerns, however, it is worth noting that modern life is not completely devoid of hope and assurance. Scientific advancements in medicine and disease prevention, for one, have brought great progress and promise for human health and welfare. The development of vaccines and other preventive medicines mean that more people are able to live long and healthy lives without the threat of debilitating and deadly diseases. Similarly, the globalization of trade and commerce has led to greater interconnectivity and understanding between nations, helping to foster a more peaceful and harmonious world order. The advent of renewable energy sources and other environmentally friendly technologies has also provided hope that we can mitigate the worst effects of climate change and ensure a sustainable future for ourselves and generations to come.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that fear and insecurity are significant issues facing modern society, it would be too simplistic to suggest that our world is exclusively defined by these negative emotions. New technologies, economic fluctuations and growing threats to personal safety and security may be testing our resilience, but they are not insurmountable, and we continue to find ways to triumph over these challenges. Rather than succumbing to fear, we must confront these challenges head-on, armed with our collective determination, ingenuity, and resolve.",

The internet, which has become a staple in our daily lives, also presents ample opportunities for cyberbullying, online scams and the spread of false information. And as we become more and more interconnected, the fear of pandemics like the H1N1 virus, SARS and COVID-19 grow in proportion. Socially, there is also a growing feeling of insecurity that arises from the breakdown of traditional social institutions like the family and community. The pace of modern life has put a strain on social relationships, and the rise of single-person households and smaller family sizes has led to a decrease in social cohesion and support. This, in turn, creates a sense of isolation and vulnerability in individuals which can fuel feelings of anxiety and stress.\nHowever, it is not all doom and gloom in modern society. There are many aspects of our lives today that offer us a sense of stability and security. For example, the advances in medical science and care have helped to increase our life expectancy and provide us with better health outcomes. Education has become more accessible and equitable, allowing individuals to achieve their full potential regardless of their socio-economic background. In addition, the interconnectedness of our world has allowed us to learn from other cultures and traditions, broaden our perspectives and deepen our empathy and understanding. Social media, despite its flaws, has also connected us with people and communities that share our interests and concerns. Lastly, global cooperation in tackling crises like climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that when we work together, we can overcome even the most daunting challenges.\nIn conclusion, it is true that modern society is rife with fear and insecurity, whether it is from new technologies, economic instability or social breakdown.

With 24-hour news channels and social media constantly reporting on cases of rape, murder, and terrorist attacks, it is understandable why many people feel unsafe walking around in their own neighborhoods. In response to this, many governments have implemented strict security measures such as CCTV cameras and police patrols, which although provide some level of reassurance, they can also create a sense of mistrust and paranoia among communities. In addition to safety concerns, people also fear the future. Job security, career prospects, and the rising cost of living all contribute to a sense of uncertainty and unease about what lies ahead. The pressure to succeed and keep up with the fast-paced, competitive nature of modern society can also cause anxiety and stress, leading to mental health issues such as depression and anxiety disorders.\nDespite all these fears and insecurities, there are also many things that provide us with a sense of safety and stability in our modern world.

            "human_gen_truncate": "gs. In fact, according to Phillip Morris, author of \"Peer Pressure and Smoking\", teenagers who had at least three friends who practiced underage smoking were ten times more likely to follow suit than those who did not. Moreover, data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicates that many more juvenile crimes are committed in groups as compared to adult crimes. This shows that juvenile delinquency can be attributed to the pressure teenagers face from their friends, as at that age, an individual'sthought pattern can be easily molded, and hence individuals are more easily involved in delinquent acts as a teenager. Teenagers may feel that he or she will be alone if they do not follow their peers, and this fear of isolation drives them to be part of a peer group, who might be indulging in negative activities. Therefore, other than child neglect, delinquency in juveniles could also happen due to the herd mentality and peer pressure faced.\nConversely, rather than negligence, parents can go the other extreme and spoil their children. As a result, even though they are involved in their children'slives, they fail to act as disciplinarians and therefore cannot keep their children in line. For instance, Hollywood actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie'schildren are notorious for bad behaviour, such as setting fire to leaves outdoors or being violent with fellow schoolchildren. This is often attributed by sources to the couple'scaring tendencies, particularly to the children they adopted. Moreover, with the vast amount of freedom granted, coupled with the abundance of material possessions and money these parents grant their children easily, children thus have more opportunities to mix with bad company and commit acts of felony. Therefore, although negligent parents can be the cause of juvenile delinquency, parents can also be over-caring and not have the heart to correct their children when necessary, leading to children lacking self-discipline.\nFurthermore, while parental negligence is a significant factor contributing to juvenile delinquency, it comes hand-in-hand with how children react to the lack of attention from their parents. While there is evidence proving that parental negligence does lead to higher instances of juvenile delinquency, there are children who faced child neglect growing up, but have not gotten into trouble with the law growing up, and were even able to attain success in life. It is true that children learn discipline and independence through the lack of support received from their parents, as they are also being corrected by other influences such as guardians or teachers, and it ultimately comes down to the attitude and tenacity of the child. Many celebrities such as Jamie Foxx, Kelly Clarkson and Adele were neglected by their parents at a young age and even throughout their teenage years. However, due to their spirit of resilience and strength, they chose to pick themselves up and fight hard for their dreams, despite the absence of their parents. This therefore allowed them to achieve success, and even motivated them to stay away from trouble. Therefore, whether children fall into the trap of juvenile delinquency depends on the attitude and resilience that they possess.\nUltimately, delinquency can certainly be attributed to parental negligence due to a parent'shuge role in a child'slife as his or her sole provider and source of support, as well as the root reason of a child'sneed for parental love. However, it must also be acknowledged that juvenile delinquency is caused by the interplay of factors ranging from peer pressure faced by youths, to the act of parents spoiling their children. Different cases of juvenile delinquency stem from different causes, but it is certain that a parent'srole in a child'slife cannot be replaced. Hence, I would agree that the most important factor for delinquency is the negligence of a child by his or her parents.",

Other factors such as peer pressure, poverty, and mental health issues also contribute to juvenile delinquency. Peer pressure, for instance, is a significant factor that influences adolescent behavior. Adolescents who associate with delinquent peers are more likely to engage in criminal activities (Schofield, 2018). Poverty, on the other hand, is linked to poor social and economic outcomes, which increase the likelihood of children engaging in delinquent activities. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can make children more vulnerable to negative influences, which can lead to delinquent behavior.\n\nAnother factor to consider when examining the relationship between parental negligence and juvenile delinquency is the impact of parental incarceration. Children whose parents are incarcerated are more likely to experience parental neglect and lack of supervision, which can lead to delinquency (Dong and Krohn, 2016). Moreover, the trauma of parental incarceration can cause emotional and behavioral problems that contribute to juvenile delinquency.\n\nIn conclusion, parental negligence is a significant factor contributing to the rise of juvenile delinquency. Children who experience parental neglect are more likely to engage in deviant behaviors, such as drug use and involvement in gangs. However, while parental negligence is one of the significant factors contributing to juvenile delinquency, it is not necessarily the most significant. Other factors such as peer pressure, poverty, and mental health issues also contribute to juvenile delinquency. Therefore, it is essential for parents and other stakeholders to address all the factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency to reduce its incidence in Singapore. This can involve providing better parental guidance and support, enhancing mental health services, improving intervention programs, and addressing poverty.",

For example, a teenager may feel pressured to join a gang or participate in truancy, as being involved in these activities can give them a sense of belonging and acceptance in their social circle. Furthermore, teenagers are prone to making impulsive decisions and may not fully calculate the consequences of their actions. This may lead them to engage in dangerous activities such as reckless driving or theft, which can result in serious legal consequences. Peer pressure can also lead to cyber bullying, which is becoming increasingly common in today's digital age. As teenagers are constantly on their phones or laptops, they may be exposed to negative comments or gossip online, which can then lead to physical altercations and even depression. However, while peer influence plays a significant role in teenage delinquency, it is important to note that strong family values and dynamics can counteract its effects. For instance, a teenager who has a healthy and supportive relationship with their family is more likely to resist negative peer influences and make positive decisions.\nIn conclusion, while there are several factors that contribute to juvenile delinquency,such as peer pressure, rebellion and stress, parental negligence is undoubtedly the most significant. Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's values and character from a young age and providing support and guidance as they grow up. However, it is also essential to recognize that other factors such as peer pressure can play into delinquency, and that a strong family unit can help to counteract these influences. Ultimately, it is important for parents to remain actively involved in their children's lives and to instill morals and values that would guide them through their teenage years and beyond.",

In today's society, students face intense academic, societal and familial pressures that can lead to anxiety and depression. This may cause them to resort to delinquent activities as a coping mechanism. Furthermore, socio-economic factors such as poverty, unemployment and poor living conditions can also lead to delinquency. This is because children from such backgrounds may not be able to receive the proper education, healthcare and resources they need to develop into well-rounded citizens. In such cases, it is the government's responsibility to intervene and provide support to these families to break the cycle of poverty and delinquency.\nIn conclusion, while parental negligence is the most significant contributing factor to juvenile delinquency, it is not the only factor. Peer influence, stress and mental health issues, as well as socio-economic factors also play a part in shaping a young teenager's behaviour. Therefore, it is not enough to just blame the parents for their children's delinquent behaviour. Society as a whole needs to address these factors and provide support to help teenagers make better choices for their future. It is only then can we hope to reduce the number of juveniles involved in crime and build a better future for our youth.",

As much as parents try to shield their children from these influences, teenagers are old enough to make their own decisions, and may choose to rebel against their parents due to the desire to fit in with their peers. This is a common problem amongst teenagers in schools, where they often succumb to pressure to engage in delinquent behavior like stealing or vandalizing school property as a means to gain social recognition and acceptance. As a result, it is crucial for parents to remain involved in their children's lives, understand their social networks, and take an interest in their friends' behavior without being overly controlling.\nFurthermore, additional factors such as socio-economic status and educational attainment may also play a role in contributing to juvenile delinquency. The rise in poverty and the lack of equal opportunities in different socioeconomic environments may lead to criminal activity, particularly among teenagers from disadvantaged backgrounds. The lack of access to quality education coupled with low income and few job opportunities may lead children to engage in activities such as theft and drug abuse as a means of making money, without having to work jobs that are low-paying or unavailable to them. This underlines the importance of creating equal opportunities, providing quality education, and combating poverty to enable everyone in society to achieve their full potential.\nIn conclusion, while parental negligence can be a significant factor contributing to juvenile delinquency, it is not the only factor. Peers, socio-economic status, and educational attainment all play a role in shaping a teenager's behavior. Nevertheless, parental involvement remains important and crucial in guiding teenagers towards making better decisions. At the same time, it is essential to recognize the impact that peer pressure, socioeconomic status, and education can have on delinquent behavior, and take steps to address these issues.

                "gs. These influences can cause a teenager to become desensitized to the consequences of their actions and lead them down a dangerous path. Their peers may reinforce delinquent behaviour by providing acceptance and validation, which only compounds the problem. Delinquency may also be a result of stress, such as academic pressures or social isolation, which can lead to depression and lashing out in negative ways. This is especially common in Singapore, where the education system is competitive and high demands are placed on teenagers. As such, it is important that teenagers are equipped with the ability to identify negative influences and make the right choices to avoid getting caught up in delinquent behaviour.\nIn conclusion, while parental negligence is the most significant factor contributing to delinquency, teenagers may also become delinquent due to peer pressure or stress. Parents and guardians should take their responsibility seriously and provide adequate support and guidance to their children. This includes communicating with them, spending quality time with them, and promoting good values and decision-making skills. It is important for teenagers to have a strong foundational support system so that they can make wise choices and avoid negative influences. Ultimately, prevention is better than cure, and investing time and effort in grooming children and teenagers will pay off in the long run.",

Teenagers may not tell their parents about their friends or what they are doing with them, leading to the parents being unaware of negative influences that could be affecting their child. The lack of communication can also lead to misunderstandings and conflicts, further driving the teenager towards delinquent behaviour. Therefore, while parental negligence is a significant factor, it cannot be the sole problem that leads to juvenile delinquency.\nIn conclusion, parental negligence is the most significant factor leading to juvenile delinquency amongst teenagers in modern society. The lack of attention, support, and guidance fromparents, due to their busy work schedules, can lead to teenagers feeling neglected, lost, and alone. This can drive them towards negative influences such as social media, peer groups, and negative role models, leading to delinquent behaviour. As such, it is crucial for parents to provide adequate support and guidance to their children from a young age to prevent delinquent behaviour in the future. This can be achieved through spending quality time with their children, open communication, and instilling the right values and morals in them, as well as emphasizing the importance of good decision-making. With these efforts, we can hope to address the issue of juvenile delinquency and create a safer and more harmonious society for all.",
                "gs. Sometimes, the pressure to fit in can also lead to deviant behaviour such as stealing or vandalism. This is especially problematic when coupled with the fact that social media and other digital channels give ample opportunity for teenagers to get in contact with like-minded individuals who promote any sort of delinquent behaviour. Additionally, school is also another significant factor that contributes to delinquency. Academic stress and bullying that teenagers face in school can push them towards delinquency as well. Furthermore, delinquency can also stem from biopsychosocial factors such as poverty or even mental health problems such as depression or anxiety. \n\nIn conclusion, while other factors such as peer influence, academic stress and mental health issues contribute to juvenile delinquency, parental negligence remains the foremost factor. With a loving environment at home, coupled with parental guidance and support, teenagers are less likely to stray into the path of delinquency. Therefore, parents must recognize and prioritize their role as a positive influence in their children's lives, even amidst the hustle of daily life. Parents should not only teach healthy habits and foster a stable home environment but also ensure a healthy relationship between parents and children that includes communication, trust and mutual respect.

Nevertheless, other factors such as peer influence and academic stress also contribute to delinquency in teenagers. Thus, it is crucial to recognize that a multi-faceted approach is necessary in tackling the issue of juvenile delinquency.

However, some Singaporeans were unhappy about it. This puts Singapore'sgovernment in a tight spot because they could lose popularity and thus lose its governance over Singapore. Of course, that would be destabilizing to the country if it were to become reality. Hence a good government would have to recognise the fact that the people'ssupport is important. They must be able to reach out to people and allow them to understand the benefits of their policies. In this sense, Singapore has managed to fulfil this through platforms such as \"Our Singapore Conversations\" where individuals give feedback and also learn more about current policies. This ensures that people do not feel alienated from the government'sdecisions and the government would be able to remain in control. Therefore, a good government must not only have the courage to make unpopular decisions but also be able to remain in power through good communications with the people.\nNevertheless, being stubborn in making unpopular decisions could end up harming citizens instead. This can occur when governments are ignorant of the current situation or if the government is corrupt. An ignorant government may mistake the possible merits of the decision or they could underestimate the costs of the decision. These policies are more often than not opposed by citizens of the country. In such situations, having the courage to implement the policy despite strong opposition can lead to undesirable outcomes for the country. To illustrate this, Brazil won the bid to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, the victory was not celebrated by many. With many parts of the country undeveloped and social services uncared for, many Brazilians were not keen on the idea of spending billions of dollars on huge soccer stadiums that would serve no other purpose other than hosting the World Cup. As such, the disgruntled members of the public took to the streets and carried out massive protests, hampering the preparations and infrastructure building for the World Cup. Although the government justified its spending by citing the huge tourism revenue and the boosting of Brazil'simage, much of their claims were overly optimistic. Multiple economic studies have shown that hosting major sporting events have more often than not led to more social problems and negative economic benefits. People'sstandard of living might deteriorate because of the huge debt the government might incur. In such scenarios, courage and confidence are often baseless and detrimental to society. The incompetence of the government led to failure and the people suffering as an unfortunate consequence. Hence, having the courage to make unpopular decisions might not be the mark of a good government if such unpopular decisions are clearly detrimental to the society.\nAll in all, a good government has to have the foresight and courage to make decisions that are beneficial and necessary for the country regardless of how unpopular it may be. It should also be astute enough to ensure its citizens still pledge support to it. Only through this way can the government implement policies that will benefit the nation in the long run. As more people become educated, they would demand greater say in decision making for the country. This could become a greater challenge for governments in policy making. Therefore a good government is also one that understands the paramount importance of reaching out and letting people understand the rationale of the policies they implement.",

Governments that constantly make popular decisions run the risk of pandering to the emotions and desires of the population, rather than focusing on effective governance and policy-making. By making unpopular but necessary decisions, a government can avoid the trap of populism and focus on evidence-based decision-making that is in the long-term interest of society. \n\nHowever, it should be noted that making unpopular decisions alone does not make a government good. A government must consider the impact of its decisions on all segments of society, especially those who are most vulnerable. A government that only makes unpopular decisions without regard to the welfare of its citizens can be seen as oppressive and authoritarian. \n\nIn addition, making unpopular decisions can also affect a government's re-election prospects, as unpopular decisions can sometimes lead to a loss of public support. A government that constantly prioritizes unpopular decisions at the expense of its public support may find itself voted out of power in the long-term. Therefore, popular support should also be considered, but it should not be the sole factor in decision-making. \n\nIn conclusion, a good government must be able to make unpopular decisions in the interest of the greater good. Unpopular decisions can demonstrate courage, leadership, and a willingness to take risks by a government. While it is important to consider the impact of unpopular decisions on society, decisions that benefit the majority should take priority over decisions that are popular but not beneficial.

As such, Singapore'scultural identity as a nation with people of diverse ethnicities living in harmony needs to rely much on the shared knowledge of past events.\nIn the chase for modernity and instantaneity, many Singaporeans believe that holding on to the past is sentimental to the point of being impractical. They would rather Singapore be defined by where we are going, not where we came from. Sadly, such a perspective is self-defeating. Without retrospect, there can be no progress, nor purpose. After all, the past offers us valuable lessons and ideas that can help us progress and prevent us from repeating the mistakes we made in the past. One famous example would be how Singapore learnt its lesson from the Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 that was sparked by tension due to the traditions of one race not being respected by the law. Thus, with such knowledge of the past, Singapore has managed to prevent race-related strife from brewing through adequate public education and respect for all races in legislation. This shows that with an understanding of the past comes a better understanding of how Singapore should manage the present and future generations in order to create an environment that allows holistic progress.\nYet another reason that a sense of history is so crucial to Singapore'sfuture is because a sense of history is not something static or unable to adapt with the times. Rather, it serves as a guide to prevent us from straying too far from the desired status quo for peace, harmony and progress. For example, after the horrifying terror events of September 11 and the Bali bombings of 2004, the peace in multi-religious Singapore became extremely fragile. This was when ministers such as then-senior minister Lee Kuan Yew reminded the country of how precious peace between ethnic groups was, and how Singapore needs to be resilient and not stray off from the mutual respect each and every ethnicity had for each other. Therefore, it was through an understanding and reverence for the past that Singapore has managed to solve the most pressing issues of its modern self.\nHence, for Singapore, or any country for that matter, to sustainably progress and succeed in the future, a shared sense of history is crucial, if not necessary. It stops us from repeating past mistakes, teaches us to handle current issues and bonds the country through the shared identity forged in the past.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ld war in the near future. Despite Iran'sclaims that its atomic bomb research is peaceful, Israel disapproves of the United Nation'snuclear watchdog decision to withhold reports of suspicions that Iran researched on how to make an atomic bomb \u2013 a potential hazard to Iran'sneighbouring countries \u2013 for reasons of diplomatic sensitivity. It is understandable for Israel, which is the only nation in the Middle East comprising Jews, to feel threatened with its Islamic neighbouring countries possessing nuclear weaponry. For Israel, this will be the proverbial \"straw that breaks the camel'sback\" and a world war may likely be triggered if Israel is pressurized to attack countries in the Middle East in the name of \"self-defence\". Therefore, the prospect of a future world war in the near future can be entertained or even, acknowledged with serious consideration, due to the greater risks of global destruction posed by the development of nuclear weapons.\nFurthermore, the ultimate reason that sparks a world war \u2013 the desire for power \u2013 has remained unchanged throughout the years. Like the Cold War, which broke out between the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc in a futile attempt to gain more geopolitical power, who is to say that another world war will not break out in the near future whereby countries attempt to monopolise global influence? Although there are regional and international policies implemented today that are serving their purpose in allocating resources in a fair and equitable manner, there are, however, exceptions where countries are not content with their lot. The innate desire of countries to dominate power, coupled with the global issue of resource depletion, increases the possibility that a world war may break out in the near future as countries engage in a desperate struggle for resources. A recent event that has been dubbed as a potential world war event is the China-Japan conflict due to Japan'sacquisition of the Senkaku islands. While Japan claims that the disputed lands were vacant before 1895, China argues that it owned the islands before 1895 based on ancient Chinese texts and maps which show that the Chinese regarded the islands as theirs. In other words, Japan'sseizure of the islands violated China'srights. But ultimately, is it not the desire to gain more power from the acquisition of lands the sole reason for the disputes between countries? In addition, with the ability of countries to lend, or remove, support to countries in conflict today due to the growing interdependence of countries, there is a possibility of a future world war if many countries are involved in the same conflict. Saying that the possibility of a world war in the future cannot be entertained is thus na\u00efve taking into consideration that the desire for power of countries has remained largely unchanged throughout the years.\nWhile some may argue that economic sanctions imposed can deter a future world war event, the truth is that there are ways to circumvent these as there will always be other states to supply and provide supplies and markets. In recent times, economic sanctions, rather than military force, are often employed in a crisis to interrupt commercial relations and weaken the economy, and by extension, the military potential of the country being sanctioned. Sanctions buy time, allowing adversaries to consider the repercussions of countries acting on a moment of impulse to trigger a world war. This ultimately deters a future world war event from occurring. However, sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving this primary aim. Despite imposing economic sanctions on Russia by countries like Germany and the United States because of its aggressive actions in Crimea to hamper trade and cripple its economy, there are other countries such as China, who are willing to supply and trade its goods with Russia. Russia is still able to get by, even with the meagre source of income from trade with only a few trading countries. Worse, sanctions may sometimes provoke the victim country instead to retaliate in other ways, possibly by resorting to military violence. Therefore, the possibility of a world war in the near future can be entertained for the fact that economic sanctions \u2013 one of the factors commonly used to prevent a world war from occurring \u2013 is actually proven to be largely ineffective.\nTo conclude, it may seem that the chances of a world war occurring in the near future are becoming smaller because in today, more and more countries are increasingly interdependent on one another for trade and other relations. However, the possibility of a world war occurring in the near future must still be entertained.",

As climate change accelerates, resource scarcity may become a flashpoint for conflicts, particularly among countries facing severe ecological or economic challenges.\n\nMoreover, a potential world war may also be triggered by political misunderstandings and distrust. Miscommunication or miscalculation among countries, coupled with a lack of diplomatic channels, may lead to tensions and ultimately a full-blown conflict.\n\nDespite the possibility of a world war, there are steps that can be taken to prevent it. First and foremost, it is crucial to reinforce international institutions and norms that promote cooperation and peaceful settlements of conflicts. Countries should work towards strengthening existing institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization and establish new ones to address emerging challenges like cybersecurity and climate change.\n\nFurthermore, countries should prioritize diplomacy and dialogue over confrontation and coercion. States need to engage in meaningful dialogue with their rivals and work towards building consensus and understanding. Confidence-building measures like arms control and military-to-military communication can reduce the risk of miscommunication and miscalculation.\n\nLastly, countries must tackle the root causes of conflicts and instability, including poverty, inequality, and authoritarianism. Addressing these factors can reduce the risk of violent conflict and promote a more stable and peaceful international system.\n\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be entirely dismissed. The current global political landscape is marked by several factors that may lead to conflicts and escalate into a larger and more destructive conflict.

                "ld war. Furthermore, the principle of nuclear deterrence \u2013 the belief that the existence of several nuclear powers would prevent any one of them from launching a nuclear attack \u2013 may not hold true today. The possession of nuclear weapons by countries such as North Korea or Iran \u2013 who may not value the principle of nuclear deterrence \u2013 poses a threat to world peace and the possibility of a world war breaking out. Hence, the development and possession of nuclear weapons research serves as evidence that the probability of a world war is higher than ever before.\nMoreover, the desire of countries to dominate could trigger a world war. The historical example of World War I is a testament to this possibility. World War I \u2013 which involved Germany, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire against the Allied countries of France, United Kingdom, Russia, and later joined by the United States \u2013 was a result of the desire of countries to dominate and establish superiority over each other. Germany was intent on becoming a superpower, after witnessing the dominance of the British Empire, and engaged in militarism and alliances to assert its power. This led to a spiralling arms race and eventually, the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary to which Germany responded by declaring war on Serbia, leading to the involvement of the Allied Powers. The desire of countries to exert their dominance could lead to an arms race, alliances and eventually, a world war. In view of this, the likelihood of a world war cannot be ignored.\nLastly, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring reinforces the notion that the possibility of a world war is still present today. Sanctions are a form of economic pressure applied by one or more states to achieve a specific political benefit. Economic sanctions have been applied in the past by the international community on countries like Iraq, following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990, and Iran, over its nuclear programme, with the aim of preventing war. However, the efficacy of sanctions in achieving its aim \u2013 to prevent a world war from occurring \u2013 is questionable. Sanctions are often viewed as a courtesy as opposed to an effective course of action and have often failed to stop countries from engaging in hostile behaviour. In fact, in some cases, sanctions have been known to lead to a country\u2019s increased resentment and the prospect of retaliatory action. Countries that feel cornered by sanctions may feel that they have nothing to lose and might engage in reckless and divisive statements that could trigger a world war. Thus, while sanctions remain a useful tool today, its efficacy in preventing a world war from occurring cannot be guaranteed.\nIn conclusion, while the trend towards soft power may be a useful model in reducing conflicts between countries today, its effectiveness against deeply ingrained hostility is often misplaced. Moreover, the development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate and the failure of sanctions in preventing a world war from occurring, supports the notion that the possibility of a world war can still be anticipated in the near future. Ultimately, the responsibility lies in the hands of nations, to engage in dialogue, seek peaceful resolutions and reject the impulse towards aggression, if the world is ever to be free of the threat of another world war.",
                "ld war. The arms race between the United States and Soviet Union during the Cold War is a stark reminder of the dangers posed by nuclear weapons research. The Cuban Missile Crisis, one of the most critical moments during the Cold War, brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. This highlights the possibility of a world war occurring, even with conscious efforts by countries to prevent it.\nMoreover, the desire of countries to dominate is a factor that contributes to a world war. Countries that have a strong longing for power and recognition are more likely to use hard power to achieve their goals. Countries that show signs of military aggression are often seen as potential sparks of conflict. For instance, the aggressive expansion of Nazi Germany in the early 20th century led to World War II. Similarly, China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea, which involve multiple countries, raise concerns about the possibility of a future world war. The fact that countries are still willingly to take extreme measures to attain political hegemony over others highlights the possibility of a world war taking place.\nFinally, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring cannot be dismissed. Sanctions are a means of persuading countries to change their behaviour and comply with international norms. However, sanctions can only go so far in changing a country's behaviour. North Korea, despite the imposition of several rounds of economic sanctions by the United Nations, refuses to abandon its nuclear weapons programme. Sanctions imposed on Russia following the annexation of Crimea have not brought about significant changes in Russia's foreign policies and actions. The lack of compliance with sanctions by countries is a reflection of the ineffectiveness of soft power and diplomacy.\nIn conclusion, while the increasing employment of soft power has reduced the likelihood of a world war, other factors such as the development of nuclear weapons, the desire of countries to dominate and the failure of sanctions to bring about change indicate that the possibility of a world war cannot be dismissed completely. It is thus crucial for countries to remain vigilant, continue diplomatic efforts and engage in international cooperation to prevent a world war from occurring.",

North Korea, for example, has threatened to use its nuclear weapons on the United States and South Korea, a move that can easily escalate into a full-scale conflict if it feels threatened by either country. Likewise, if a militant group managed to get their hands on nuclear weapons, they could use them as leverage to get what they want from the international community, leading to a potential world war.\nFurthermore, countries' desire to dominate and assert their power can lead to a global conflict. History has shown that countries' expansions have led to conflicts and ultimately, wars. The rise of China as a superpower, for instance, has led to increased tensions between China and the United States, the current world superpower. Both countries are vying for dominance in the region, with each viewing the other as a potential threat to its interests. In addition, economic and territorial disputes, such as the conflicting claims in the South China Sea, have further escalated tensions, raising the possibility of a world war.\nIn conclusion, while soft power may be a useful tool to prevent conflicts and world war, it cannot be relied upon solely to achieve lasting peace. The development of nuclear weapons research, countries' desire for dominance and power, and the abuse of soft power by extremist groups all contribute to the possibility of a world war. It is crucial for countries to continue diplomatic efforts in resolving conflicts, and to work towards disarmament, in order to avoid the catastrophic consequences of a world war.",
                "ld war. North Korea's consistent attempts to conduct nuclear tests has provoked numerous countries to take military action, with the United States being the most prominent. The development of nuclear weapons research signifies how conflicts between countries can escalate, making a world war a more likely possibility. Furthermore, it highlights how countries' increasing distrust for each other can result in heightened security measures, leading to more countries arming themselves with nuclear weapons.\nMoreover, the desire for countries to dominate is another factor that could ultimately lead to a world war. As countries such as China and Russia grow more powerful, other countries are more likely to become wary of their intentions. They would want to contain the rise of these influential countries to prevent them from completely dominating and taking control of the world. The rise of China, for instance, has triggered the United States'Pivot to Asia policy, which aims to contain China's influence in the Asia-Pacific region. A country's need to dominate can cause other countries to react similarly, and that could escalate into a world war.\nLastly, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring is another possibility. Despite the use of soft power measures to resolve conflicts, the imposition of economic sanctions against countries that are perceived as threats has been an ineffective deterrence measure. Countries such as North Korea and Iran have not yielded to the sanctions imposed on them, instead aggressively pursuing the development of nuclear capabilities. The failure of such measures only serves to embolden these countries in their quest for dominance, ultimately leading to more severe forms of aggression, such as military conflict.\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war occurring cannot be dismissed despite the shift towards more soft power-based approaches in resolving conflicts. The development of nuclear weapons research, the desire for countries to dominate and the failure of sanctions all contribute to the possibility of a world war happening in the future. As such, countries must remain vigilant in their efforts to avoid conflict and work towards cooperation and diplomacy to ensure global peace.",
                "ld war. North Korea's nuclear weapons research is an example of the high tensions that arise due to nuclear weapons research in a country. Despite sanctions from the international community, North Korea has continued its research and development of their nuclear arsenal. This has made other countries wary of North Korea, leading to potential conflicts. The prospect of a nuclear war is a global threat, as it can have severe consequences for humanity. Not only are nuclear weapons capable of mass destruction, but radioactive fallout can also lead to widespread health issues for generations. As countries continue to develop their nuclear programs, the threat of a nuclear war looms large, making the prospect of a world war a possibility.\n\nFurthermore, the desire of countries to dominate and attain power poses a threat to the world peace. Seeking to control resources, territories or economic markets has been the main motivation for countries to go to war. In the past, the quest for resources led to conflicts such as the World War II, where Japan and Germany desired control over oil resources. The same applies to economic markets. China's expansionist policies in the South China sea has led to disputes with its neighboring countries, triggering concerns over a possible conflict between the countries. The desire by countries to establish dominance is innate, and if not controlled may result in a world war. Despite international efforts to strengthen the rule of law and promote peace, there are still countries that seek to expand and exert dominance over others. The desire for power by countries can result in conflicts that may spread and escalate, leading to a global conflict.\n\nFinally, the failure of sanctions to prevent world conflict makes the possibility of a future world war a realistic one. Sanctions have been employed by the international community as a means to stop countries from engaging in a conflict that may lead to a world war. However, despite the imposition of sanctions, countries such as North Korea and Iran continue to engage in activities that threaten world peace. The failure of sanctions in preventing these activities is evidence that sanctions may not be an effective way to prevent a world war. With no adequate way of preventing countries from engaging in actions that destabilize peace in the world, the possibility of a world war can no longer be ignored.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the shift towards soft power as a tool to prevent conflicts, the development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate, and the failure of sanctions to prevent conflicts pose a significant threat to world peace. The possibility of a world war cannot be ignored or dismissed. It is imperative for countries to work together to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner to avoid a global disaster. Failure to do so would lead to a world war that may be costly and destructive for humanity.",
                "ld war. The possibility of a world war is further escalated when rogue states like North Korea and Iran are seen to be developing nuclear weapons. In fact, there is already a growing concern that North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons may trigger a nuclear arms race in Asia with countries like South Korea, Japan and China likely to follow suit. Even if a world war does not break out as a result of the nuclear arms race, the devastation that such weapons can cause is immense. It is therefore important for countries to take necessary measures to prevent nuclear weapons research from escalating to a level where world destruction is possible.\n\nMoreover, countries desire to dominate, which may lead them to take risks that could lead to a world war. Countries seek dominance because they see it as the only way to maintain their interests. The aspirations of countries like China and Russia to become major powers may see them take aggressive measures against neighbouring countries, in their pursuit of dominance. For example, the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea between China and its neighbouring countries, which saw China building military installations on artificial islands, threatens to destabilise the region. Similarly, the annexation of Crimea by Russia and its involvement in the conflict in Ukraine is viewed as an attempt by Russia to expand its influence in former Soviet states. Thus, attempts to dominate by countries may lead to conflicts that could spiral out of control and result in a world war.\n\nLastly, sanctions, which are often seen as a way of maintaining peace, may not be effective in preventing conflicts. Sanctions are economic measures taken by countries to put pressure on other countries to change their policies. While sanctions may have worked in the past to resolve conflicts, there is no guarantee that they will work in the future. In a world where countries are interconnected, the notion of economic security is paramount. Sanctions that disrupt trade may therefore not be effective in preventing conflicts. In fact, they may exacerbate the situation and lead to the breakdown of diplomatic relations between countries. The failure of sanctions to prevent a war from occurring is seen from the United States' inability to prevent World War II by imposing economic sanctions on Japan in the lead up to the war.\n\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war cannot be entirely dismissed despite the trend towards soft power. The development of nuclear weapons, the desire of countries to dominate and the failure of sanctions to prevent conflicts are all factors that may lead to a world war in the future. Therefore, it is important for countries to pursue peaceful means of resolving conflicts and to avoid taking actions that could escalate regional conflicts into a global war.",
                "ld war. The Cold War illustrates this point where the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union left countries in fear of the possibility of a nuclear war. The Cuban Missile Crisis was one of the most significant moments in this conflict, where a nuclear war was only averted due to the negotiation efforts of both sides. The nuclear arms race resulted in a sense of unease and precariousness in world affairs. Similarly, North Korea's nuclear weapons program has been a source of concern for countries in the region. North Korea'sdevelopment of nuclear weapons for self-defense has become a major obstacle for diplomatic relations, making conflict resolution more difficult than it already is. The possibility of a miscalculation from either side could trigger a deadly disaster. Hence, the development of nuclear weapons research is an obvious peril, and the knowledge that a world war is a possible outcome must not be ignored. \nFurthermore, the desire of countries to dominate is the major cause of tension amongst countries, which can easily spiral out of control. The classic example is World War II, which was brought on by Adolf Hitler's desire to dominate Europe. The vast expansion of Nazi Germany threatened the security of other countries, which ultimately led to a global conflict. In today's context, territorial ambitions remain a recurrent source of tension between countries. The South China Sea dispute is a current issue that underscores the desire of China to assert its territorial claims over the region as it seeks to expand its sphere of influence. The dispute has resulted in incidents of brinkmanship, escalating tensions and heightening the risk of conflict. The desire for power, resources, and territory can indeed lead to a state of conflict where war becomes a means of achieving those goals. \nMoreover, sanctions put in place by international organizations as an attempt to avert a world war cannot be relied on entirely. Although sanctions are designed to bar countries from achieving their objectives, some countries have shown an ability to defy international norms and still attain their goals. North Korea has been able to withstand the effects of UN sanctions and maintain its nuclear weapons program. Countries like Russia and Iran have also been able to bypass sanctions to continue their affairs. Furthermore, imposing sanctions on countries has its risk. It can deteriorate a country's economy and cause suffering for its citizens, leading to further escalation of hostilities rather than compliance with international norms. Hence, sanctions alone cannot guarantee peace and stability in the world. \n\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war may seem bleak with the emergence of soft power as well as other measures taken to prevent it from happening. However, one must not ignore the possible sources of tension that exist in the world. Nuclear weapons research and territorial ambitions remain causes for concern where the slightest provocation can cause a global catastrophe. Sanctions put in place by international organizations have only achieved mixed results and have failed in some instances. It is thus important for countries to work towards resolving disputes peacefully and promote greater understanding amongst each other. Only by striving towards peace and cooperation can we work towards avoiding the prospect of world war.",

It is well documented that the US almost went to war with the Soviet Union during the Cold War, because of the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba by the Soviet Union. It took a lot of diplomacy and negotiations to prevent a nuclear war from occurring. It thus seems that the development of nuclear weaponry provides a real possibility of a world war happening.\n\nMoreover, the desire of countries to dominate is another factor that could lead to the outbreak of another world war. Countries will do whatever they can to maintain their power and influence. With the rise of China as an economic powerhouse, it is only a matter of time before it tries to assert its dominance on the global stage. The Chinese government's recent expansionistic policies in the South China Sea has raised tensions with other countries like the Philippines, Vietnam and Japan. Both China and the US are engaged in a power struggle to assert their dominance in the region. This tension could very well escalate into a full-blown war, dragging other countries into the conflict and causing a world war to break out.\n\nFinally, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring could mean that the possibility of a world war in the future cannot be completely ignored. Sanctions are often imposed to prevent countries from engaging in certain activities such as nuclear weapons development, that can lead to conflicts with other countries. However, sanctions have not always been successful in their aim of preventing a war. Sanctions that were imposed on North Korea have not succeeded in stopping the country from developing nuclear weapons. Similarly, sanctions have not been successful in stopping Russia from expanding its territory and supporting its allies. When diplomacy fails, it is only a matter of time before countries resort to force to pursue their objectives which could trigger a world war.\n\nIn conclusion, while some might argue that the possibility of a world war can be ignored due to the rise of soft power, it is important to consider that soft power can be exploited and abused by others. The development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate, and the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war cannot be ignored. As such, it is important for countries to work towards building diplomatic ties and resolving conflicts in a peaceful manner to avoid another world war from happening.",
                "ld war. Furthermore, the development of nuclear weapons also presents the risk of accidents happening during operational use or accidental launches due to system errors. The catastrophe that may occur due to a nuclear attack or accident is unimaginable, and hence, every effort must be made to prevent a world war from happening. Amidst the development of nuclear weapons, it is crucial that countries engage in peaceful negotiations, such as the nuclear arms control treaties, to ensure that countries do not operate or possess excessive amounts of nuclear weapons. Treaties such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) signed by the United States and Russia set a limit on the deployment of strategic nuclear warheads and have contributed to an overall reduction in nuclear weapons worldwide. However, it must be noted that these treaties cannot guarantee that nuclear war will not occur. Countries may still choose to violate the treaties, leading to rising tensions and the escalation of conflicts, threatening the world with the possibility of a world war.\nMoreover, the desire of countries to dominate others may also be a reason why a world war may occur. Countries continue to vie for resources such as oil, land and water, which may be the cause of conflict between countries. Countries also have different ideologies or value systems that may prompt them to challenge each other \u2013 for instance, the United States and China's conflict over human rights may escalate to a full-scale war if they are unable to find a peaceful solution. The desire for global dominance may be further fueled by intense nationalism, which has the ability to incite a country's population, leading to a rise in extremist movements and the willingness to engage in violent conflicts. The increasing use of cyber warfare may also lead to countries attacking each other's economic and political systems, further aggravating the situation. It is crucial that countries pursue peaceful diplomacy, instead of resorting to violence, to resolve conflicts. International organisations such as the United Nations play a major role in preventing a world war by facilitating cooperation and communication between countries. However, countries must also be willing to put their differences aside to ensure harmony and prevent the destruction that a world war may bring.\nFinally, sanctions imposed by the international community may fail to prevent a world war. Sanctions are used as a tool to pressure countries and individuals to change their behaviour or policies. However, sanctions also have the potential to backfire, leading to the opposite effect when the targeted individuals or countries feel cornered and resort to violence to protect their interests. An example would be the failure of sanctions against North Korea, which have not stopped the country from pursuing nuclear weapons research. Instead, it has resulted in an economically isolated country that feels threatened by its neighbours and is unwilling to negotiate. Sanctions must be enforced carefully to ensure that the targeted individuals or countries do not face severe economic or political consequences that may lead them to pursue violent means to achieve their goals.\nIn conclusion, despite the shift towards soft power in international relations, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be ignored. The development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate others and the failure of sanctions to prevent conflict all increase the likelihood of a world war. It is crucial that countries engage in peaceful diplomacy, pursue treaties that limit the number of nuclear weapons, and cooperate with each other to prevent conflicts that may escalate into a full-scale war.",
                "ld war. For example, North Korea's continued nuclear testing has caused tensions with neighbouring countries. Despite sanctions and attempts to persuade North Korea to stop its nuclear programme, the country has continued its testing, leading to heightened tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the region. It is possible that North Korea, feeling threatened by these sanctions, might decide to launch an attack on any of its enemies, causing a major global conflict.\nThe desire of countries to dominate, no matter what the consequences, is also a reason why a world war is possible. In the past, countries have waged wars with the intent of expanding their territories or resources. History has shown that countries have often looked to wage war as a means of acquiring territory or resources or expanding their economic influence. The Chinese government's claims on the South China Sea, for example, have caused tensions in the region, with other countries such as Japan and the Philippines opposing their claims. Tensions have escalated as China continues to militarise the disputed islands despite opposition from other countries. The possibility that one or more countries may attempt to dominate the rest is ever-present, and history has shown that this has led to catastrophic wars in the past.\nFinally, sanctions, while often viewed as a peaceful tool for diplomacy, have failed to prevent war throughout history. The policy of appeasement adopted by countries prior to the Second World War, through which they tried to pacify the aggressor rather than confront them, is an example of the failure of sanctions. It is possible that economic sanctions can have negative consequences such as a decline in trade or the demise of an economy, which can trigger a country to a war. Moreover, some countries may feel that they have nothing to lose and may become more aggressive in their actions. In this case, sanctions have little effect on countries that are determined to go to war.\nIn conclusion, while soft power and diplomatic resolutions should be the primary solution to resolving external conflicts, the continued development of nuclear weapons research, the desire to dominate, and the failure of sanctions to prevent war indicate that the possibility of a world war cannot be dismissed. The need for global cooperation and a genuine commitment towards peaceful negotiation should be the principle adopted by countries to avoid the horrors of a world war. Countries should also strive to shift their focus from militarisation to global leadership, where they can work together for the greater good of mankind."

            "prompt": "IS THERE STILL PRIVACY IN TODAY\"S WORLD ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NEED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "d about their privacy, governments around the world have also realised their onus to set up laws to protect the privacy of their citizens. In this day and age where technology allows personal information to be easily accessed by others, many nations worldwide have agreed that privacy is a right that should be granted to all people and that individuals should be allowed by law to defend this right. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations since 1966, has an article that protects privacy, which states that \"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence\". It also grants everyone the right to be protected by law against any such interference. As such, this treaty acknowledges that there should be regulations set in place to defend the personal information of individuals. To date, 168 states have agreed to the treaty, and have in turn established their own legislations to protect the privacy of their citizens. In Singapore, for instance, the Protection of Private Data Act was enforced in 2013 for this very purpose. It can be seen that privacy still exists in today'sworld with the protection of personal information through the help of laws and regulations set up by governments.\nMoreover, in an increasingly democratic world, the political privacy of ordinary citizens is especially important in ensuring fair and unbiased voting so that they are protected against intimidation by electoral candidates. As more and more nations begin to adopt the voting system in government elections, political privacy is an increasingly pertinent right for all citizens, as candidates voted into parliament are expected to serve all citizens equally, without any bias towards those in favour of them or discrimination against people who voted against them. This is only possible if the choices of individual voters are kept secret. A case in point would be my society, Singapore, where polling stations for elections are set up with individual booths where voters are given their own space to mark their ballot paper. One is also advised to keep his vote a secret. This is also the case for many countries worldwide. Hence, privacy still exists as citizens are able to keep their political choices secret and unknown by other people.\nAll in all, despite privacy being a lawful right and having various means to protect it, it is an undeniable reality that people enjoy less privacy today than in the past, with technology that can potentially allow personal information to be disclosed to various organisations clandestinely, even if for grounds such as national security. That said, it is too extreme to assert that privacy no longer exists in today'sworld even if it is increasingly harder to achieve.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "y may well be a luxury in some cases.\n\nIt can then be argued that access to our data for the sake of national security does infringe our fundamental human rights on privacy. The long term impact of such collections can lead to issues such as identity theft, invasion of personal privacy, and abuse of power. There is no better example of this than the headlines surrounding various State-sponsored cyber-attacks which exposed the personal data of thousands of citizens resulting in thefts and subsequent future breaches.\n\nFurthermore, the vulnerability of data to cyber-attacks is of great significance. A breach of data results in citizen's information being out in the open, not only to governments but to malicious hackers and criminal organizations as well - posing a double threat to national security. The risk is higher if the data is not correctly safeguarded; therefore, it's imperative to address the challenges of cybersecurity while regulating privacy issues.\n\nNonetheless, arguments can be made in support of the loss of privacy. The government's actions to prioritize national security over privacy rights are understandable, especially when it comes to matters that threaten the peace and security of the country. This need to safeguard one's nation trumps individual needs since national security issues are at the forefront of governments' actions, rather than individual needs. Thus, national security is paramount against privacy concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of privacy today must take into account not just the benefits but the inherent vulnerabilities that come with it. The world as we know it is developing too fast, and there exist threats that could undermine our very freedom and liberty. It is however necessary for Governments to have an ethical approach to balancing these concerns, with measures in place to prevent abuse of power while upholding privacy principles. A system that provides privacy while still allowing for effective law enforcement is possible. Therefore, it would require social responsibility on the part of individuals, corporations, governments, and societies worldwide to work collaboratively to find that balance and provide solutions that wouldn't compromise the right to privacy in any significant way.",

                "d about their rights to privacy, there are many instances where privacy still exists. One such instance is political privacy. In a democratic society, every citizen has the right to participate in the politics of their country. This includes the right to vote and participate in political discussions and debates. However, in order to exercise this right, citizens must be given a certain degree of autonomy to express their opinions without fear of reprisal. Political privacy allows people to express their opinions freely, campaign for their preferred political party and hold controversial beliefs. As such, political privacy is a crucial component of democracy and cannot be overlooked.\nAnother measure that indicates the existence of privacy is the implementation of laws to protect privacy rights of citizens. Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA)  governs and regulates the collection, use, disclosure and care of personal data. This legislation has been implemented to protect the personal data of individuals in Singapore and to ensure that organisations do not abuse or misuse this data. The Act applies to all private sector organisations except those in sectors where there are existing sector-specific data protection rules. The establishment of such protective measures indicates that while privacy may be threatened, it is not entirely gone.\nIn conclusion, the issue of privacy in our modern-day society is undoubtedly a contentious one. While the need to compromise on privacy for the sake of national security continues to remain pertinent, it is not correct to claim that privacy is no longer of value. There are still instances whereby privacy exists, including political privacy and the protection of privacy rights by laws. Consequently, the value of privacy in contemporary society remains significant and relevant.",
                "d about their privacy, there are still instances where privacy is respected and protected. One such instance is political privacy, which is crucial for democracy to function effectively. Political privacy refers to the ability of citizens to keep their political beliefs and activities confidential from the government and others without fear of persecution or discrimination. This ensures that citizens are able to exercise their right to free speech and expression without fear of reprisal. In Singapore, for example, the Political Donations Act ensures that political donors remain anonymous, allowing for the protection of political privacy as well as the prevention of corruption.\nFurthermore, laws such as the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore protects personal data from being used for purposes outside the consent of the individual. The PDPA governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations across the country. This ensures that the privacy rights of citizens are respected when personal data is being collected and used.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that in some cases, privacy has to be sacrificed for greater security, it is erroneous to claim that privacy is no longer present in today's world. Instances such as political privacy and laws for personal data protection demonstrate that privacy is still highly valued and respected. With technological advances, it is crucial for governments to balance national security with the privacy rights of citizens. As Anthony Burgess said, privacy remains one of the most precious things one can ask of the modern world.",
                "d with the protection of their personal information, privacy still remains an important issue. Political privacy, for instance, is an area where people still value their privacy rights. Politicians and public figures who are under intense scrutiny all year round often desire some level of privacy to conduct their private lives. An example of this is when former US President Barack Obama, in an attempt to shield his family from unwanted attention, made sure his daughters had limited exposure to the media when he was in office. Additionally, there are laws and regulations designed to protect people's privacy rights. In the European Union (EU), citizens enjoy the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which legally enforces companies and organisations to obtain their consent first before collecting, storing and processing any personal information. Any violations of the GDPR can result in hefty fines. In Singapore, individuals can take legal action if their personal information is being used without their consent. These examples indicate that privacy still exists and is protected, contrary to the popular belief that it has disappeared in today's world.\nIn conclusion, while the need for greater national security has led to the trading off of personal information for security purposes, various instances continue to indicate that privacy still exists. People still demand privacy for other aspects of their lives, such as political privacy. Furthermore, laws and regulations have been put in place to protect people's privacy rights, thus making privacy a vital aspect of individuals' lives in today's modern world.",
                "d about privacy, there are still many circumstances in which privacy remains intact. One of the significant contexts where privacy is entitled to exist is in political privacy. Political privacy allows individuals to speak out freely on political matters without fear of retaliation and without the fear of having their views being monitored, spied on, or disclosed by the government. This is important as it promotes democracy, encourages active political participation, and helps protect the rights of individuals. Another example is the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union which gives citizens the right to control their personal data while prohibiting the use of such data without their consent. Those companies or organizations who violate the GDPR can be heavily fined. Therefore, it can be argued that privacy rights still exist in a world where technological advancements have increased governments' control and surveillance over personal information.\nIn conclusion, the debate over privacy is ongoing, and its future remains uncertain. While governments continue to argue that compromises on privacy are necessary in the interest of national security, individuals and privacy advocates contend that governmental surveillance should not infringe upon individuals'privacy rights. Nonetheless, the evolution of technologies that enable greater control and surveillance of individual privacy necessitates the re-examination of policies that aim to balance privacy rights and national security. Therefore, it would be wise to consider both perspectives before reaching a conclusion on whether there is still privacy in today'sworld.",
                "d about their privacy rights, political privacy is still very much protected. Political privacy is the right to keep one'spolitical beliefs and affiliations away from the knowledge of others. This is particularly crucial in democratic countries where individuals have the right to freedom of speech and expression. In such countries, privacy laws have been enacted to protect individuals from any form of discrimination as a result of their political beliefs. An example of this is the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) in Singapore. This law prohibits organisations from collecting, using or disclosing an individual's personal information without his or her consent. It also gives individuals the right to access and correct any errors in their personal information. By allowing individuals the ability to protect their own information, privacy still exists in countries like Singapore even with the many technological advances.\nIn conclusion, while it may seem that privacy is no longer a right in today'sworld, it is erroneous to claim it no longer exists. Personal privacy has undoubtedly been compromised with the need for greater national security. However, political privacy and the existence of privacy laws to protect personal information highlight that privacy still remains a crucial right for individuals in today's world. It is important for governments to strike a balance between the need for national security and preserving the privacy rights of their citizens.",
                "d about their privacy, there are still situations where privacy remains, especially when it comes to political privacy. Beyond physical privacy, political privacy refers to the right of citizens to express their opinions and ideas without fear of persecution or repression from authorities. This allows individuals to engage in political activities such as lobbying or political campaigns without fear of retaliation or intimidation from those in power. A classic example of this was during the protests in Hong Kong against the proposed extradition bill in 2019. Protesters, many of whom were student activists, used encrypted messaging apps to organise themselves and communicate, allowing them to avoid detection and retaliation from the Chinese government. This is a clear indication that political privacy still exists even in a world where citizens are constantly under surveillance.\n\nMoreover, in many countries, there are laws in place to protect the privacy rights of citizens. For instance, in Singapore, there are data protection laws such as the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) which governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations. The PDPA also provides for individuals to access their personal data that is held by organisations and to request for any corrections to be made to it. This ensures that individuals have control over their own personal data and can make informed choices about who they share their data with. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is another example that provides for the protection of personal data. These laws are clear indications that privacy rights are still being respected and upheld, even in a world where technology has made it easier for data to be shared and accessed freely.\n\nIn conclusion, though privacy has been the subject of debate for many years, it is erroneous to claim that it no longer exists. While there are certainly situations where individuals'privacy has to be infringed upon for the sake of national security, political privacy and data protection laws serve as evidence that privacy still remains an important right that individuals enjoy in today's world.",
                "d about the protection of their personal information, privacy still remains in various aspects of life. One such aspect is political privacy. Political figures such as state leaders require a certain degree of privacy in order to make wise decisions without the influence of others. This is because their decisions carry significant impact on the rest of the country and their citizens. Additionally, privacy laws for citizens are being implemented and improved worldwide. In Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) sets rules on how personal data should be collected, used and disclosed by organisations. This gives individuals greater control and protection over their personal data. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union also gives individuals rights to access, rectify and erase their personal information, among others. With privacy laws like these in place, it is certain that there is still a level of privacy that can be maintained in today'sworld.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are instances where privacy is compromised for national security, privacy still exists in certain aspects of life and is protected by laws. As Burgess stated, being left alone is still valued in modern times, and it is important for individuals to recognise the boundaries in which organisations can collect and use their personal information. Through greater awareness and advocacy for stronger privacy protection laws, the protection of privacy in today's world can be preserved.",
                "d about their personal information, there are still instances where privacy remains. In the political world, privacy is important for a number of reasons. From diplomatic negotiations to counselling and advice sessions between leaders and their advisors, the privacy of these conversations must be maintained in order to ensure the good governance of a country. For example, any leaked diplomatic cables may damage relationships and put geopolitical co-ordination at stake. Furthermore, in the legal world, laws exist to protect individuals'privacy rights by ensuring that personal information cannot be disclosed inappropriately. This can be seen in the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. The GDPR gives individuals greater control over their personal data and allows them to request the removal of their personal data from databases under given circumstances. Through these examples, it is evident that privacy still exists in our society.\n\nIn conclusion, although technology has increasingly allowed governments access to people's personal information for national security purposes, privacy still exists in today's world. Instances of political and legal privacy show that people have the right to keep their information private. While it can be argued that we need to give up some of our privacy for the greater good, the right to privacy should not be disregarded completely. Ultimately, we have a responsibility to ensure that technology and government surveillance do not become invasive and overly intrusive in our private lives.",
                "d about their privacy rights, there are still numerous cases where privacy is still well-respected. One key example is the protection of political privacy where politicians and other government officials have the privilege of keeping their personal and home information hidden from the public domain. This is especially true for heads of state, where their personal safety may be at risk if their whereabouts and movement schedules are published for the public. In addition to political privacy, there are also laws in place to protect citizens' privacy rights. For instance, countries like Singapore have the Personal Data Protection Act which governs the collection, use and disclosure of personal data. This includes requiring companies to obtain explicit consent from individuals for the collection of their personal data, and individuals have the right to access their personal data and submit corrections. Such laws serve as a safeguard against organisations that may seek to misuse personal data for commercial gains or otherwise. As a result, there are still instances where people can expect to have their privacy rights upheld and respected.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are concerns that privacy may be eroded in an increasingly interconnected world, it is vital to recognise that privacy still exists in various forms. There may be instances where personal information is collected without an individual's knowledge or consent, but this is often done in the name of national security. Nonetheless, political privacy and laws like Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act serve as examples of how privacy rights can still be preserved. As such, while it is important to scrutinise the ways in which personal information is shared, one can still expect to have a degree of privacy maintained in today'sworld.",
                "d about their personal information being exposed, there are still many instances where privacy is protected. One example is political privacy in the context of elections. Countries around the world have strict laws against the collection and dissemination of sensitive information of voters such as their race, religion and political affiliations. This is especially so during the election period when politicians and parties campaign to win the trust and support of eligible voters using various tactics such as social media and rallies. The protection of personal information not only ensures fairness in the election process, but also protects voters from potential discrimination or harassment for their political stance. Another example of the protection of individuals'privacy rights is through the implementation of various privacy protection laws. For instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union is a law that gives individuals more control over their personal data. Companies that breach the regulation may face hefty fines and lawsuits as a signal of how seriously privacy is taken in the EU. This demonstrates that privacy is still a highly valued aspect of societal norms, and is not extinct as it may seem.\n\nIn conclusion, while the need for national security may have led to intrusions into individuals'privacy, it is erroneous to assume that privacy is no longer a concept in today'sworld. Examples of political privacy and privacy protection laws show that societal values continue to regard privacy as an important aspect of individual liberty and autonomy. It is ultimately a question of finding a balance between privacy and security, in which neither aspect needs to be fully compromised for the other to exist."

Critics of national security measures argue that undue invasion of privacy could have significant consequences, such as the exposure of sensitive personal data or the infringement of civil liberties. Privacy is crucial to maintaining autonomy and dignity; It protects individuals' right to associate, communicate, organize freely, and make decisions without fear of unwanted intrusion. Any infringement on the right to privacy inevitably threatens other civil liberties, including freedom of expression, free speech, and association.\n\nIn conclusion, privacy is a fundamental human right that has been threatened in recent times by the need for national security. While national security is essential for every sovereign nation, it is equally essential to balance it with the respect for individual autonomy and other essential civil liberties. While there is no doubt that governments have a vested interest in ensuring national security and public health, they must exercise appropriate measures that maintain an individual's privacy rights. In balancing the interests of individuals and nations, there must be transparency, accountability, and adequate safeguards to ensure the protection of individual privacy and prevent misuse of power.",

It is important to consider the implications of allowing such vast power to a government agency without strict oversight and accountability mechanisms. Moreover, the collection of sensitive information could increase the likelihood of discrimination and profiling based on religion, ethnicity, and political affiliation. Also, with the growing prevalence of cyber-attacks and data breaches, there is a potential risk of personal data falling into the wrong hands, exposing individuals to identity theft and other forms of fraud.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate around the balance between privacy and national security is complex and multifaceted. The right to privacy is essential to maintaining our autonomy and dignity as individuals, while national security is essential to defending our sovereignty and protecting our citizens from harm. The challenge is finding the right balance between these two rights and ensuring that the government has strict oversight and accountability mechanisms to prevent any abuse of power. Governments need to be transparent and engage in more public consultations to gain citizen trust and confidence to ensure that any compromise of privacy rights is proportionate, necessary and will serve a legitimate public interest.",

Still, measures taken to limit the right to privacy must be justified with an adequate reason to prevent abuse by the government or any other entity. Thus, it is essential to have stringent guidelines and regulations controlling the way governments can access, store, and share citizens' data and information.\n\nIn conclusion, privacy is a fundamental human right that is critical to our autonomy and dignity. The need for national security is equally important, but this should not mean that our privacy rights are compromised by governments or other entities. There should be some form of balance between the two concepts to protect and preserve individual privacy rights while ensuring public safety and security.

There have been concerns about data breaches in which personal information could be accessed by unauthorized individuals, posing risks such as identity theft, cyberstalking, and other malicious activities.\n\nTo conclude, the debate around privacy and national security is complex and multifaceted. While national security plays a vital role in maintaining a country's stability and welfare, it should never be at the expense of its citizens' privacy rights. Governments worldwide need to balance the need for security with individual privacy rights, taking into account the risks and benefits of their measures.

They argue that national security should be pursued without compromising an individual's right to privacy. On the other hand, those that support national security assert that safety concerns must be balanced against individual privacy. They argue that the protection of citizens is of the utmost importance and that governments have a duty to do everything in their power to preserve it.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate on the issue of privacy versus national security is far from settled. As technology continues to evolve, it provides more opportunities for governments to collect personal data to achieve their security objectives. Governments must find a way to strike a balance between privacy rights and safety concerns to sustain a just and fair society. One should not negate the other, ultimately.

Governments need to ensure that the interest of their citizens' privacy rights is not traded for the illusion of security. By doing so, they can make certain that their countries are secure while still protecting their citizens' liberty, autonomy, and dignity.

While the need for national security must be acknowledged and addressed, it is essential to balance it with our right to privacy. Governments and private entities must be transparent about their data collection practices, and individuals should be aware of their rights.

It is essential to strike a balance between these two concepts, especially given the advancements in technology that make it more difficult to maintain our privacy. Governments need to ensure that measures taken to protect national security do not infringe on people's privacy or unfairly target specific groups. Citizens must also be educated on the importance of privacy rights and to hold their governments accountable for any breaches. Only then can we ensure that both privacy and national security are protected in today's world.",

This led to a backlash against the use of technology for mass surveillance, with many people demanding that their private information should be protected from prying eyes.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over national security and privacy is complex, and it is unlikely to be resolved anytime soon. Nevertheless, it is crucial that governments find a balance between protecting the privacy rights of their citizens and ensuring national security. They must use surveillance tools and data collection methods that are both proportional and necessary for the goal they want to achieve. It is also critical for individuals to be mindful of the data that they share and to be aware of their rights to privacy.

            "prompt": "\"FOREIGN AID DOES NOT SOLVE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.\" TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS A FAIR VIEWPOINT?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "whole, whether foreign aid works thus lies in whether they are funding a country with strong institutions with potential for growth, or feeding one that is corrupted. David Cameron said that it is not really about the quantity of aid but rather what he terms as the \"golden thread\", which is whether the country has stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law and transparent information. It is when these institutions are in place, that the dollars can make sense.\nNonetheless, donor countries also have the responsibility to consider carefully how they disburse their aid. Unfortunately, the pattern of giving has been one of fragmentation. Donor countries want to seem as generous as possible, so they give to many countries, but in small amounts. This leads to aid coming from more directions but in smaller amounts. In 2013, the average project funded by aid was worth $1.9 million in 2013, down from $5.3 million in 2000. In Mozambique, it has 27 donors in the field of health alone, but some countries each give less than $1 million. This kind of fragmentation reduces the efficiency of aid, because they require civil servants to manage and oversee, increasing the amount of bureaucracy while having less economies of scale in terms of impact.\nAnother problem with foreign aid is also how donor countries decide to give. Long term problems require long term aid, but countries often fluctuate in their level of support, withdrawing support just when developing countries begin to gain traction. Researchers have found that donors tend to prefer short term projects with measurable results, a demand which aid agencies are thus inclined to meet. Thus, aid has been largely successful in building schools, infrastructure, which are tangible with straightforward benefits and timeline. However, they are not able to build strong institutions, which as discussed previously are more important.\nLastly, aid is often conditional, with donor countries threatening to withdraw them if their demands are not met. Aid is after all, not as altruistic and humanitarian as it is made out to be. Developed countries use aid to promote their interests and ideologies. For example, the UK gives more aid to Pakistan, Syria, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Afghanistan, countries which are not the poorest, but rather where the UK wishes to influence politically whether because they have a dictator or where radical Islam is taking root. Other than political ideology, developed countries also use aid to benefit themselves economically, in the form of tied aid, where aid is used to purchase items from the giving country itself. For example, close to 80% of the US Agency for International Development'scontracts and grants go directly to American firms. Sometimes, aid is given as loans, which only leads to debt accumulation. Thus, aid can reproduce existing inequalities between countries instead of helping them solve long-term problems.\nTo sum up, there are many barriers in the real world which have led to foreign aid not being able to solve long term problems. This is primarily because they are not the key to solving them, but rather a possible resource to do so. In order to solve long term problems, there is indeed, no single panacea or silver bullet.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "in unachieved.\n\nAdditionally, foreign aid can destabilize the domestic market of a recipient country, making it difficult for local businesses to thrive. For instance, foreign aid could lead to the saturation of the local market with subsidized goods from other countries, leading to the collapse of local businesses that cannot compete with the lower prices. These local businesses need to grow to succeed, but with foreign intervention, they have very little room for development and innovation. \n\nAnother challenge of foreign aid is the risk of it being lost to corruption. In many cases, foreign aid ends up in the hands of governments and bureaucrats, rather than the intended recipients. In some cases, the funds are diverted to personal bank accounts overseas, leaving those in need without assistance. The remarkable lack of accountability can lead to a vicious cycle, where governments and bureaucrats become reliant on foreign aid, and the people that are supposed to receive these funds remain stuck in poverty.\n\nLastly, foreign aid programs often fail to incorporate the cultural and social traditions of the communities that they target. In many cases, these programs are designed by external entities without any understanding of the cultural differences, social networks, and leadership structures of the people they are trying to help. Consequently, these intervention programs may be rejected, which can lead to the underutilization of the aid. Even if the program is utilized, it may not address the social and cultural problems of the community, rendering it ineffective in the long run. \n\nIn conclusion, the idea that foreign aid is not a long-term solution to poverty is valid to some extent. While it can provide immediate relief, stimulate economic growth, and promote development, it can also foster dependency culture, disrupt the domestic market, erode governance standards, and fail to incorporate the cultural-sensitive approach needed in addressing social issues. Therefore, for foreign aid to be effective, it should be designed carefully to provide targeted assistance, foster self-reliance instead of dependency, provide accountability, and be culturally sensitive.",

This approach is known as capacity building and has been used effectively in countries like Botswana and Costa Rica to help them develop more self-sufficient economies. Another way to improve the effectiveness of aid is through greater transparency and accountability, ensuring that aid is used as it should be and that governments in the recipient countries are held accountable.\nIn conclusion, foreign aid is a complex and nuanced issue with both potential benefits and drawbacks. Although it has been criticised for failing to solve long-term problems, there have been successful examples in the past that have had a significant impact on improving the lives of people in developing countries. What is clear is that the problem of foreign aid is not an inherent one, but rather a problem of how it is implemented and managed. By improving the transparency, accountability, and focus of foreign aid, it is possible to make it a more effective tool for solving long-term problems in the developing world.",

Critics argue that foreign aid is often a tool of political influence and power rather than true altruistic intent. For instance, the Marshall Plan was more about countering Soviet influence in war-torn Europe than being a purely humanitarian gesture. Similarly, China's Belt and Road Initiative has been criticised for promoting China's political and economic interests rather than helping local communities in recipient countries. If the motivation behind foreign aid is not purely to help and support others, it stands to reason that it may not be as effective in solving issues.\nIn conclusion, foreign aid has its share of success stories, particularly in the eradication of diseases and the development of economies. However, it has also been criticised for not being effective in solving long-term problems and even causing more harm than good in some cases. It is crucial to evaluate not only how foreign aid is used, but also the intent and motivations behind the giving of aid.

When aid is poured into a country to fund specific projects or sectors, it can disrupt the balance of local industries by creating an oversupply of goods or services. This can lead to local businesses not being able to compete and eventually closing down, resulting in unemployment and economic instability. Moreover, there are also concerns about the sustainability of foreign aid. While it may provide short-term relief, it may not address the underlying issues that led to the need for aid in the first place. This leaves countries reliant on aid, which can create a sense of complacency and hinder long-term development.\n\nIn conclusion, while foreign aid has the potential to solve long-term problems, its effectiveness is highly dependent on how it is utilised and managed by countries of destination as well as the intent and pattern of giving from the countries of origin. Foreign aid should strive to address underlying issues and work towards sustainable development rather than just providing temporary relief. Ultimately, it is important to remember that foreign aid is just one small part of the solution to long-term, complex problems, and that it cannot be relied upon as the sole solution. A collaborative, multi-faceted approach involving both local and international stakeholders is needed for development and progress to be achieved.",

Without proper transparency and accountability, aid money can be siphoned off by officials or used for personal gain, rather than for development purposes. In some cases, it may even perpetuate conflicts and fuel corruption, further worsening the situation.\nIn conclusion, while foreign aid can potentially solve long term problems, its effectiveness is dependent on various factors such as good governance, transparency, and accountability. Aid needs to be used strategically and in conjunction with other efforts towards development, such as promoting fair trade and investment, promoting democracy and human rights, and encouraging private sector growth.

This practice can also create a dependency on the donor country, leading to a lack of independence and sustainability in the recipient country's development.

It is a nuanced topic, with many contributing factors involved, including the targeted countries' political stability and commitment to positive change. Giving foreign aid should not be viewed as a one-size-fits-all solution to development challenges, but rather as part of a toolbox of tools that can be effective when well implemented.

Ultimately, the effectiveness of foreign aid depends on a range of factors, including the needs of recipient countries and the intentions of donor countries. Despite the risks and uncertainties, however, foreign aid remains an important tool for addressing some of the most pressing problems facing the world today.

To be effective, foreign aid needs to be accompanied by a more comprehensive, multilateral approach that helps developing countries build sustainable economies and work towards self-sufficiency.

            "human_gen_truncate": ", pressure when imposed on oneself over prolonged periods of time can make one unhappy, as it can lead to both physical toil and mental turmoil. Science has shown that prolonged pressure can lead to symptoms like migraines and headaches which impede functioning, as well as well-being. It has effects on nearly every part of the body, from causing gastrointestinal disorders to endocrine malfunctioning. Unexplained disorders are thus often a result of stress. For example, athletes who are pressured may force themselves to train way harder than they actually want to, making them fatigued and ironically, able to perform less than optimally, setting themselves up for a vicious cycle as they then try to train even harder to make up for it. People may tell themselves that they are never good enough, which in suitable doses makes one work harder. However, if one continually subjects oneself to such criticism whether by themselves or by others, they are setting themselves up for lower self-esteem. The pressure thus causes people to break because regardless of how much they work, they never think they can succeed. This is the basis of the best-selling book \"Secret\", which encourages readers to do the opposite and believe in themselves instead of being overcome by pressure.\nPressure can also cause unhappiness when they make goals the end in itself.  Ultimately, this can even lead them to think of success as something they must have, rather than a desirable goal. The difference between the two is that the former will make people tie their self-worth and their entire world to whether they succeed or not. This is so true for many students who are extremely pressured by expectations arising from themselves, teachers or parents that they must perform well for their exams, believing that any other outcomes are construed as failures. Stories of young children committing suicide after scoring poorly for exams in Singapore are unfortunate examples of how pressure can be toxic.\nFinally, we must also take into consideration the fact that different people have different capacities for pressure. While some enjoy the adrenaline of pressure and perform well under it, others cannot cope with it and break under it. It is thus more important for people to identify for themselves when they are over the optimal threshold, when pressure switches from motivating force to a cause for unhappiness, and then apply strategies that work for them. Different people have different strategies to deal with it: some people will take a break from what they are pressured by, such as by playing recreational sports or engaging in their hobbies while others require the support of family and close ones.\nIn conclusion, whether pressure is a motivating force or a cause for unhappiness depends on why one is experiencing pressure, and how one experiences it.  As with many things in life, balance is what people should strive for, in order to make pressure a friend rather than a foe.",

Besides direct government transfers, governments have to prioritise when devoting resources to agencies helping different social groups, hence making an inclusive society a chimeric fantasy.\nFurthermore, eradicating income inequality and the inequality of opportunities require an overhaul of the capitalist system of Western nations and the global economy, which is simply quixotic and unrealistic. The free movement of labour, goods and capital across national borders along with rapid technological advancement means that technically able, high-skilled workers tend to command higher wages, while low-skilled manual workers are easily displaced by an influx of workers from less developed countries. Inequality has risen drastically across the world, in both developing and developed countries as a result: in Brazil, the top 1% accounts for 25% of national income; in Russia, the income share of the top 1% of the population increased from 4% in 1980 to 20% in 2015. Likewise, in India, that figure rose from 6% in 1982 to 22% in 2013 and in China, it surged from 6% in 1978 to 14% in 2015. Compound this with the fact that the rich tend to pass on financial and social privileges to their offspring, and inequality is entangled with decreasing levels of social mobility. This suggests that attempts to create an inclusive society have to take into account the overarching societal framework which we operate in, and a total overhaul of it seems implausible. Even in countries which adopt alternative models such as communism, there is often skyrocketing inequality as well. Even though communist countries like the Soviet Union managed to reduce income inequality to unprecedented levels, it did so by reducing the size of the pie for everyone, and displacing existing capitalist structures with other hierarchies that disadvantaged the poor and the unfortunate. It appears that in the current context, achieving an inclusive society might just be an ideal, at best.\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that the above arguments rest on the assumption that an inclusive society is desirable; it well may not be, indeed. Many argue that an inclusive society where diversity is celebrated and not resented is a more tolerant, pleasant one to live in, and allows individuals of varied talents to live up to their true potential. If Singapore had not created a space for entrepreneurship, or encouraged its students to deviate from traditional models of success, the likes of Carousell, honestbee and ViSenze would not have existed. That said, however, efforts to make society more inclusive might conflict with the need to be factually accurate. For instance, sporting authorities in the Western world have permitted the participation of transsexual individuals in sporting events, as societies become more progressive and inclusive over time. However, critics often cite the unfair advantage that pre-transition transgender athletes have over biological females, which is ignored when transgender athletes are allowed to participate as females, as an example of \"inclusivity\" being taken to the extreme, to the extent that reality is wilfully distorted.\nBy and large, an inclusive society is desirable and pleasant to live in, as it maximises human potential, if it is created or done in moderation. However, because there are finite resources for an infinite number of social groups clamouring to be included, the reality is that achieving an inclusive society can only remain a pipe dream for now.",

Employment opportunities provide these marginalized individuals a way to earn a livelihood that is otherwise difficult for them to.\n\nBesides, promoting inclusivity in various aspects of life can enhance social cohesion, thus creating stronger communities. Social cohesion is a state that fosters unity, understanding, and cooperation among different groups in a society. When different groups can come together and work towards a shared goal, it leads to a more conducive environment and better opportunities for everyone. Social cohesion can be enhanced by the government and community leaders by organizing events and initiatives that break down barriers and promote inclusivity. For instance, in Singapore, the government organizes community events such as the National Day celebrations and communal gatherings, which promote social cohesion by bringing people from different backgrounds together to share their cultures and experiences.\n\nDespite the various ways in which an inclusive society can be achieved, it is worth acknowledging that this may not always be an easy task. Different factors may pose challenges that may complicate the process of attaining an inclusive society. One such factor is profound prejudices that define the behavior of individuals in the society. Prejudices can often be deep-seated and difficult to eradicate, making it hard for individuals to work towards creating a more inclusive society. For instance, in most parts of the world, there is still discrimination against marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and refugees.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my view that achieving an inclusive society is desirable and achievable. Although there are challenges that may hinder the process, it is important to acknowledge the potential benefits of promoting inclusiveness such as better social cohesion, stronger communities, and a more conducive environment for everyone.

This suggests that current measures aimed at achieving an inclusive society may be insufficient. \n\nFinally, one of the main challenges to achieving an inclusive society is the systematic support of Western capitalist economies and the international economy's current hierarchy of power. The Western capitalist model of economy privileges profit maximisation, which leads to increasing levels of income inequality, poverty, and wealth concentration among the richest, with the poorest struggling to have access to basic necessities. Though it is true that wealth has trickled down to some, there remains significant pockets of poverty and disadvantage around the world. Additionally, the world economy is often structured to favour certain individuals or societies over others. This means that certain groups often have the power to affect the direction of policy and the economy despite not being representative of society as a whole - a flaw that undermines efforts toward inclusivity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the dream for an inclusive society is a noble effort, the processes required to achieve it are riddled with challenges and complexities brought about by historical, economic, and political factors. Current measures towards achieving an inclusive society may not be sufficient. An inclusive society will require significant effort and recalibration of the existing models of economy and policymaking at the national and international level.",

However, for now, we must continue to try to promote tolerance, inclusivity and diversity in the ways that we can, while understanding the limitations and boundaries that exist.",
                "he government, income inequality remains an issue, with the Gini coefficient hovering around 0.4 for the past decade. This means that there is a large wealth gap between the richest and poorest in society, indicating that current measures to create an inclusive society are insufficient.\nAchieving an inclusive society also entails meeting the needs of all its members, including those with disabilities. It is easy to neglect the needs of this group of people as they are often seen as a minority whose issues are peripheral to that of the majority. However, a truly inclusive society is one where people with disabilities are able to participate in society on equal terms as other individuals. This means that facilities such as public transport, buildings and public spaces need to be designed in such a way that they cater to the needs of people with disabilities. Thus, it is imperative for governments and policy-makers to consider not just the needs of the majority, but also the needs of people with disabilities so as to create a society that is truly inclusive.\nIn conclusion, an inclusive society is one where all members of society benefit from progress and equality of opportunity, diversity is celebrated and individuals, including those with disabilities, are allowed to participate in deciding the creation and direction of social institutions. However, achieving this requires more than just rhetoric and multiculturism. Current measures are often insufficient as they tend to emphasise differences between individuals and neglect meeting the needs of minority groups. Therefore, it is important for governments and society as a whole to re-examine their existing policies, and promote a more equitable society where all individuals have a chance to thrive.",
                "he government, the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, continues to hover around 0.4, indicating a significant disparity in wealth distribution. Thus, as much as an inclusive society may be a commendable goal, it is inherently difficult to achieve due to the hard realities of finite resources and competing demands.\nIn conclusion, the dream of creating an inclusive society is both desirable and elusive. While it is a lofty goal to aspire towards, achieving it requires a fundamental overhaul of society's existing norms, values and systems, including how the economy functions and resources are distributed. Nevertheless, such a goal should not be abandoned; instead, society should continue to improve incrementally and find ways to mitigate existing societal problems so that everyone can enjoy progress and benefit from a more inclusive and tolerant society.",
                "he government, income inequality still persists, with the top 20% of households receiving 44% of total resident household income. It seems that while efforts can be made to ensure that all members of society benefit from progress, they can only be successful in mitigating rather than eradicating inequality.\nFurthermore, achieving an inclusive society requires a fundamental overhaul of existing social institutions like Western capitalist economies and the international economy. Capitalism is often criticised for promoting the belief that the accumulation of wealth and material possessions is the ultimate goal of life. This has contributed towards exacerbating imbalances in income and wealth distributions between the rich and the poor, making it more difficult for the latter to access resources necessary for a decent quality of life. Similarly, the international economy's emphasis on competitiveness and profit-making means that developing countries often remain on the fringes of the global economic system, unable to access the resources they need to provide basic services to their populations. Therefore, making progress towards an inclusive society requires a restructuring of economic and political systems, though it is uncertain whether this is possible in the current global climate.\nIn conclusion, an inclusive society is not just desirable, it is necessary. However, the process of achieving it is a difficult one, fraught with limitations and obstacles. Therefore, it is important for us to continuously assess existing measures and policies to determine their effectiveness in promoting inclusivity, and to consider alternative approaches where necessary. While a truly inclusive society may seem like an unattainable goal at times, we must continue to strive towards it in order to build a better and fairer world for all.",
                "he government, there is still a significant gap in wealth between the rich and the poor. In fact, the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, has remained stubbornly high despite government efforts to decrease it. This suggests that while efforts to promote an inclusive society are noble, they are not a panacea for all societal ills, and more fundamental changes need to be made to the functioning of economies and societies if we are to achieve true equality of opportunity.\nIn conclusion, while the dream of creating a truly inclusive society is laudable, the road to achieving it is paved with many challenges that require significant changes to be made to the way societies function. We need to not only accommodate diversity but celebrate it, ensuring that it is an asset and not a liability. Governments need to allocate resources wisely to promote equality of opportunity, whilst maintaining the delicate balance of keeping society functioning. Until such fundamental changes are made, an inclusive society will remain a vague, if attractive, ideal to strive towards, but one that will be difficult to achieve.",
                "he government, the GINI coefficient \u2013 a measure of income inequality \u2013 has remained stubbornly constant at around 0.45 since 2008. Thus, while an inclusive society where everyone benefits from its progress is desirable, the reality is that achieving this requires a monumental effort and an overhaul of the foundations of the capitalist economy that we live in.\nIn conclusion, while the dream of creating an inclusive society is a noble one, the fact remains that achieving such an ideal is fraught with challenges. The uneven distribution of resources and inherent differences between individuals demands that we aim for a society that is tolerant but not dismissive of differences, and allows for some degree of prioritisation in order to promote progress. Nevertheless, it is important to strive towards this ideal, for in doing so we create a more tolerant and accepting society, and allow for individuals to fulfil their fullest potential.",
                "he government, the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, remains stubbornly high.\nFurthermore, an inclusive society necessitates that all individuals are allowed to participate in deciding the creation and direction of social institutions, regardless of their social status, race, gender or religion. Participatory democracy is one approach adopted in many countries in an effort to give every citizen a say in political decision-making. However, the extent to which this is truly achievable even in developed societies remains in question. In many instances, the voices and opinions of the minority might be drowned out by the majority, or the more powerful and privileged individuals or groups in that society. This imbalance in power and influence could make an individual feel disenfranchised and apathetic towards active participation in the democratic process. In the United States, voter suppression and gerrymandering have been persistent issues in recent years, highlighting the fragility of even the veneer of democracy. In Singapore, while the government encourages citizen engagement and feedback through avenues such as focus groups, the effectiveness of these initiatives in truly incorporating all voices into the decision-making process remains uncertain.\nIn conclusion, while striving towards an inclusive society is a noble endeavour, the numerous challenges in achieving this goal indicate that it is unlikely to be realised in the near future. Nonetheless, it is still important for individuals and societies to continue pushing for inclusivity, through ongoing discussions and debates, policies and initiatives that address inequality and discrimination, and through expanding political participation and agency. Ultimately, the journey towards an inclusive society is a continuous one, with little room for complacency or apathy.",
                "he government, income inequality persists. As of 2020, Singapore has one of the highest levels of income inequality among developed nations, with a Gini coefficient of 0.458. The gap between the rich and poor in Singapore has continued to widen despite efforts to address it, such as the introduction of progressive taxation and schemes like the Workfare Income Supplement. It seems that while efforts to create an inclusive society are necessary, they might not be entirely effective in solving the problem of income inequality, which can only be solved through wider systemic changes in the economy and political structures.\nDespite the challenges in creating an inclusive society, it is still important to strive towards it. An inclusive society is one that is not only tolerant, but genuinely accepting and celebrates diversity. It eliminates the need for affirmative action policies, since the playing field is levelled for all members of society. It also creates an environment where all individuals can contribute to the best of their abilities, which benefits society as a whole. While achieving an inclusive society might seem quixotic, we must not give up on the dream. We need to continually reassess the efficacy of current measures and come up with new ones that can bring us closer towards this ideal. Only then can we truly say that we have created a society that is fair and just for all.",
                "he government, income inequality persists. Singapore has one of the highest Gini coefficients, which measures income inequality, in the developed world. This means that while government policies like the Workfare Income Supplement and the Progressive Wage Model do alleviate the economic plight of some lower-income groups, they do not translate to an equal share of the gains from economic progress for all members of society. Ultimately, the question of whether a truly inclusive society can be achieved depends on whether we, as individuals, are willing to sacrifice for others. It requires a significant change in mindset, and for us to recognise that we are all in this together. Only then can we start to approach the ideal of a truly inclusive society."

            "human_gen_truncate": "mous athletes in the world, whether Michael Jordan with his own Nike line, or Cristiano Ronaldo (with 322 million social media followers) who also has a $1 billion Nike Contract and his own brand, CR7. However, local sporting athletes are not nearly as well known by the public. This is also due to an overall lack of interest in sports in general. During the early days of Singapore football when locals were more fired up by it, local footballers like Fandi Ahmad had many fans. However, attention to local leagues and competitions is no longer comparable to international level competitions whether in football or tennis. Without some level of recognition by society, sporting achievement by local athletes does not translate to fame and fortune, unlike in the case of other countries.\nHow sporting achievement is defined also determines how it is recognised in Singapore. The overall situation In Singapore when it comes to the recognition of sporting achievement is a polarised one. If one is not exceptionally talented and achieves incredible results such as in the case of Schooling, one is not recognised and duly rewarded, or even supported. This stems from Singapore'spragmatism in the measurement of sporting achievement. Athletes are ranked into different levels depending on their potential to represent Singapore at regional or national levels, and ultimately rewarded based on the medals they win. While this is not \"unfair\", it pegs recognition to results rather than to effort, which is often tremendous when it comes to the amount athletes have to put in, especially in view of the fact that they could be pursuing more lucrative careers. Coming back to the monetary grant by the government, the size of the amount shows how sporting achievement is not on the same level as say, an actual occupation, even though athletes spend the same, if not more, amount of time training.\nSporting achievement is also often tied to national interests, and thus some athletes who do well in sports internationally are not recognised. Ben Davis'sdeferral which was rejected by the Ministry of Defence was based on the idea that his career is a personal pursuit, rather than for national glory. Again, this pragmatic and calculative approach simplifies what sporting achievement can mean in Singapore. If the word \"Singapore\" is not tagged to the achievement, it seems that it is not considered worthy. While being able to represent one'scountry is also what most athletes probably have in mind, the relationship should also go both ways. In Davis'scase, instead of rejoicing in the fact that a Singaporean is playing in the UK leagues, it was framed that he was simply playing for his personal interest. Ironically, the government has spared no expenses in \"importing\" foreign talents for the sake of earning more medals based on this idea that sporting achievement is valuable because the Singaporean brand name is on it.\nOverall, it is a vicious cycle: athletes are recognised only if they are extremely successful, but there is no support for them because there is little hope that they will be. The safer route is and will probably always be to pursue academics and skills rather than to pursue sports, because sports brings neither monetary rewards nor fame to athletes in the case of Singapore, and therefore sadly, there is much truth in the essay questions that sporting achievement is not adequately rewarded or recognized in my country.",

Moreover, the limited opportunities for professional athletes in Singapore can also limit the recognition of sporting achievement. Unlike in other countries, where professional athletes are well-recognized and rewarded, many sports in Singapore remain amateur, which limits the extent to which sporting achievement can be recognized.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for society to appreciate the different types of sporting achievements, not just those in national or international events. Singapore has a vibrant sporting culture, with many individuals participating in different sports intensively as amateurs. However, the achievement of these individuals is not well-recognized in society. For instance, a local runner who wins a marathon in Singapore may not receive the same recognition as someone who gets a bronze medal at the Olympics. This can lead to a perception that only nationally or internationally recognized sports events merit recognition, while other sporting achievements do not.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that Singapore has made significant progress in promoting sporting activities and recognizing sports achievement. However, there exist challenges in the recognition of sporting achievement due to factors such as an emphasis on academic excellence, the limited opportunities for professional athletes, and a lack of appreciation of different types of sporting achievements. To address these challenges, there is a need for society to develop a more holistic approach to the recognition of sports achievement, where both national and local sporting achievements are appreciated and celebrated.

The lack of recognition and value given to sporting achievements may limit the potential for Singapore to produce more world-class athletes, who can bring further glory to the nation.\nIn conclusion, Singapore needs to do better in recognizing and valuing sporting achievements if we want to encourage more people to pursue their dreams of becoming great athletes. This requires a shift in mindset, from one that places academic achievements on a pedestal at the expense of everything else, to one that embraces sports as a viable and important career option. The government can take the lead in this by providing more financial support for athletes and investing in sports facilities and development programs.

In order to remedy the situation, the government has to recognise that sports are not only good for health, but also for development of character and well-being of individuals. To do this, more resources should be provided for sports and physical activities, both in terms of financial aid and infrastructure. The government should also recognise sporting excellence as equally significant as academic achievement and thus encourage people to pursue their passion for sports. This can be done by providing scholarships, awards and recognitions to athletes who perform well on the international stage, so as to create a culture that celebrates sporting achievement. Additionally, the general public can promote awareness of and interest in sports by attending local sporting events, which gives athletes more exposure and potentially attracts sponsors to them.

It is important for parents, schools, and society as a whole to recognise the importance of sports as not just good for health, but potentially also a career. The government also has a role to play, by ensuring there are enough funds poured into sports development, to ensure no athlete is denied a chance to pursue their dream solely due to lack of financial resources. Furthermore, there should be greater recognition and support for athletes who have made achievements in sports that might not be as high-profile, so that they too can stand a chance to earn a living through their sport.

To address this issue, there needs to be more awareness and recognition for sporting achievements in Singapore, as well as greater support and investment in sports from both the government and the private sector.

This creates a vicious cycle - without financial rewards and recognition, fewer young people are motivated to pursue sports as a viable career option, and without a strong pool of athletes to choose from, Singapore will continue to struggle in international sports competition.\nTherefore, it is imperative that the Singapore government, as well as society as a whole, start recognizing the significance of sporting achievements and acknowledge the hard work and dedication that goes into becoming an elite athlete. This can be done by instituting support schemes that provide financial support to promising athletes, as well as creating more opportunities for recognition and commercial success. At a societal level, the narrative around sports needs to shift from just being a pastime to being a platform for national pride. Singaporeans need to be made aware that sports can bring immense joy and national pride, while also providing career options and investment opportunities.\nIn conclusion, the lack of recognition for sporting achievements in Singapore is a serious issue that cannot be ignored. The country needs to recognize the potential of sports to not just promote health but create a sense of national pride and bring about economic benefits.

This issue begins at an early age and extends to professional sports, affecting the development of sports in Singapore. While schemes like Direct School Admission have increased the value of sporting achievement, more needs to be done to bridge the gap with academic achievement. More financial support could be given to lower-profile athletes, and greater media coverage given to local sports.

Many Singaporeans are also unaware of the slew of sporting talent that Singapore has, which includes athletes such as swimmer Quah Zheng Wen, bowler Shayna Ng or shooter Jasmine Ser, and their numerous accomplishments. If Singapore wants to truly succeed on the global sporting stage, we need to give greater recognition and support to our athletes, not just those who succeed at the highest level, but those at all levels.

As a result, there is less incentive for Singaporeans to pursue a career in sports, and the talent pool is therefore smaller than it could be.\nThe lack of priority given to sporting achievements also has implications for the development of sports in Singapore at professional levels. As mentioned earlier, even in the Singapore Sports School, academic results were given the same weight as sporting achievements. This may have the effect of leading many students to focus more on their academic studies at the expense of their sports development. For those who are talented in their sport, it may mean that they are not receiving the optimal amount of training, resources and support needed to reach their full potential. This translates to Singapore sports teams often being unable to compete on the international stage.\nIn conclusion, the issue of sporting achievements not being well-recognized extends from an early age up till professional level sports, which has implications for the extent to which sports can be developed in Singapore. While efforts have been made to increase the value given to sports achievements, many Singaporeans still view academic achievement as a more respectable option. Monetary rewards for Singaporean athletes are also not as forthcoming as they are in many other countries, which means that becoming a sportsman or sportswoman is not always considered a viable option.

Therefore, even if athletes do well in their sport, they might not receive the fame and recognition that they deserve, which would otherwise help them gain more lucrative endorsements.\n\nTo conclude, the lack of recognition for sporting achievements in Singapore is multi-faceted. From an early age, sports are often not given as much emphasis as academics, and this mindset persists even in later years. Besides, the financial rewards for athletes are not substantial, and it is difficult to make a living from a sporting career. Lastly, the sporting industry is not as well-established or recognized in Singapore, which means that even if an athlete performs exceptionally well, they might not attain the fame or financial rewards that they might in a different country. Nevertheless, more and more athletes are being recognized for their achievements, and steps are being taken to nurture the sporting industry in Singapore.

This creates a vicious cycle whereby only the very best can reap the monetary benefits, while the rest are left struggling. The solution to this problem is not an easy one, as it requires a shift in societal attitudes towards sporting achievements. Sporting achievements should be given the same recognition and prestige as academic achievements, and athletes should receive the support and funding they need to pursue their dreams. Only then can we hope to create a thriving sporting culture in Singapore where athletes of all levels can be celebrated and rewarded for their hard work and dedication."

While national borders are not particularly restrictive to the highly mobile, cosmopolitan parts of the population, those who are refugees are usually shunned as they are seen as unproductive and resource-grabbing. The often-raised question of \"Why are we providing them with housing etc. when they are not one of us?\" reveals the mentality of scarcity and how  citizens are conditioned to believe that the life of one of their own is more important to one not of their own.\nNational boundaries are also problematic for economic development. They are used for wealthier countries to suppress those which are less powerful. National boundaries restrict trade between countries, and some countries like America also impose tariffs on imports for particular industries in order to protect their own. While there are the ironically termed \"Free-Trade-Agreements\", they allow goods to flow freely only between countries which are part of the agreement, and often exemplify unequal balances of power between countries. The developing countries are made to open up their economies so that the wealthier can purchase their natural resources, but they may not be given the same kind of access to those of the developed thanks to protectionist policies. On the other hand, multinational companies which are footloose in their operations often have manufacturing in one country, research and development in another and their markets in another. These companies thus facilitate the flow of people, goods and resources across national boundaries, and countries suspend concepts of sovereignty in order to woo their investment.\nOverall, the concept of national boundaries are thus increasingly being challenged in the global age we are in, whether by the increasing prominence of cities or multinational companies. In China, being from Beijing would already distinguish one from someone from Shanghai. When Trump won the presidential elections, some in California suggested \"independence\". After all, national boundaries also vary in size. Some countries have up to a billion people, like China. Being \"imagined\", the larger they are in scale, the more fragile the common identity is. Cities have thus emerged as a more probable scale to construct a singular identity around.\nWhat we have thus is a world where national boundaries are used only to the advantage of those in power. In the past, sovereignty was used by colonial masters to justify conquest. Today,  it is reinforced by countries trying to keep out refugees. What has changed is that it is also used more selectively in our global age. It is invoked when it suits the countries\" interests, yet disregarded when countries want to attract multinational companies and talented manpower. National boundaries thus contribute to unequal outcomes for individuals and countries, and are not so easily justified in today'sworld.",

Globalization has increased the interdependence between countries, as firms and individuals seek out new markets, better technologies, and cheaper inputs. National borders create artificial barriers to trade, reducing economic efficiency and creating inefficiencies such as transport and transaction costs. The longer it takes to move goods across borders, the more expensive they become, and fewer people will want to trade with a particular country. By restricting the flow of goods and people, national borders limit economic growth opportunities and make countries more inward-looking.\n\nAdditionally, national borders have negative effects on humanitarian efforts. With global catastrophes such as natural disasters or pandemics, national governments are often required to work together to resolve these issues. Natural disasters have no regard for borders and can easily cause irreparable damage. Borders and the restrictions they place on the movement of people and goods can prevent life-saving supplies and assistance from arriving in time. The same goes for pandemics, whereby many countries restrict the movement of people or prohibit entry entirely. However, this can cause added strain and problems in the country, including increasing the death rate and preventing medical professionals from entering a location to assist with containment.\n\nIn conclusion, while national borders have historically played an essential role in maintaining national identity and security, in the global age, they have limited justification. The economic, humanitarian and social benefits of a world without borders far outweigh the benefits of their existence. It is time we eliminate national boundaries and view ourselves as a collective global society, trading freely and promoting cooperation instead of enacting policies that breed separation and exclusivity. Let us be proud of our cultures but also willing to share them, our resources and help nations in times of distress, for the greater good of humanity.",

It is not enough to say that one is simply \"human\" \u2013 one's nationality and the concept of national boundaries are important considerations. This is seen in the way governments treat refugees \u2013 some letting them in while others close their borders.\n\nSecondly, in the global economy, national boundaries can also serve as restrictions against flow of capital and goods. National protectionism can mean that some countries have more difficulty than others in joining the global market. For example, in the agriculture sector, Western countries have been able to subsidise their farmers, making it difficult for farmers in other countries to compete on a level playing field. This continues to perpetuate the divide between the \"North\" and the \"South\", and limits the potential for economic development in poorer countries.\n\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are a social construct which have their origins in Europe and have evolved through the process of colonialism. In the global age, national boundaries continue to be important markers of one's identity, yet they also have implications for migration and the global economy. While we may believe in the notion of nationalism and national sovereignty, it is important to ask what cost we are willing to pay and what kind of world we want to live in \u2013 one that values the rights of the individual or one that perpetuates divides between people based on a concept as arbitrary as national boundaries.",

The idea of national sovereignty enables states to prevent individuals from seeking refuge, allowing them to turn a blind eye to human suffering. This is not only immoral, but it is also unsustainable as states will have increasingly rigid immigration policies and stricter border controls. This could further destabilise already-tense relationships between nations and could even potentially lead to violent conflict.\nSecondly, the construct of national boundaries also affects the global economy. While we live in a globalised world, national boundaries continue to restrict our ability to maximise gains from trade. Tariffs and economic sanctions are often imposed as a tool of diplomacy or power politics. The idea of trade barriers to protect local industry is outdated and often causes more harm than good. For instance, countries that practice infant industry protectionism may overproduce goods for the domestic market, limiting potentially lucrative foreign opportunities. All in all, national boundaries fail to allow countries and communities to reap the economic benefits of interdependence.\nIn conclusion, Benedict Anderson was right to describe nations as imagined political communities. The concept of national boundaries is a human construct that emerged out of specific historical and political circumstances. While nationalism and the construct of the nation-state has provided some good things like a sense of identity and pride in one's community, it is necessary to also recognise the harm that nationalism and national boundaries have caused. In the global age, it is more important than ever to find ways to cooperate and transcend these boundaries that have impeded progress and human flourishing.",

This is due to the fact that national boundaries are often designed to be exclusionary rather than inclusionary, as a way to preserve power for the dominant group. \n\nFurthermore, national boundaries have also played a role in global economic inequality. Globalisation has brought about the integration of economies, leading to the creation of new markets and increasing efficiency of production. However, this is also a process that has created winners and losers. The unequal distribution of wealth and power among different regions and countries around the world can be traced back to the colonial period, where power and wealth were concentrated in the hands of colonisers. National boundaries further perpetuate these divides, making it difficult for those who live in less developed countries to participate meaningfully in the global economy.\n\nIn a nutshell, national boundaries may be seen as a social construct that has been imposed through a combination of historical, political and philosophical factors. It is an idea that has been successful in achieving certain objectives such as state-formation, but it has also created new problems like social and economic inequality. While the global age has made it easier to draw national boundaries, it has also exposed the costs of this practice. As such, it is important for us to examine the origins, evolution and contemporary usage of national boundaries through a critical lens, in order to devise better strategies for creating a more just and inclusive world.",

Furthermore, national boundaries have not stopped global issues such as climate change, which affects all people regardless of nationality. Yet, nations continue to prioritise their own interests over the greater good of humanity, which is a failure of the national construct.\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are a social construct that have been used throughout history to justify conquest and expansion, and it continues to be a cause of conflict today. While it is important to acknowledge the significance of nationality and pride in one's country, it is equally important to recognise that nationalism can lead to harmful views and actions against \"the other\".

Is it right for us to trade with countries who have poor human rights records? Should we defend ourselves by securing our borders, or should we push for a more open and interconnected world?\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are an imagined construct, formed by political and historical circumstances, and maintained by the societal values and norms of those who live within them. It has implications for migration, foreign policy, trade relations and defence strategies.

This illustrates how national boundaries can be harmful to those who do not belong to the nation-state. Secondly, national boundaries enable countries to pursue their own interests ahead of other nations'. The global distribution of wealth and resources is unequal and national boundaries enable countries to protect their own resources from others, leading to uneven development and exploitation of smaller or less developed nations. This perpetuates a cycle of inequality and further entrenches the power structures that have been in place since before the modern era. \n\nIn conclusion, while the concept of a nation and national boundaries may seem natural and inevitable, they are indeed social constructs that have been imposed on the world through historical events and continued by present-day political systems. The unequal power structures produced by national boundaries which perpetuate global inequality and displacement have significant consequences for people around the world.

Secondly, national boundaries contribute to xenophobic attitudes and discrimination against foreign workers. In Singapore, for instance, there are concerns over the number of foreigners who come over to work, and how their presence allegedly puts pressure on the country's infrastructure. This mentality has led to the practice of segregating foreigners into designated living spaces or restricting their access to certain amenities as a matter of policy.\nDespite all this, some argue that national boundaries are necessary, as they promote unity and a sense of belonging. Countries provide a common ground for people to come together to solve issues such as poverty or natural disasters. National identities can also be used to promote positive values, such as a sense of pride in one's culture. Furthermore, without national boundaries, there may be no way to address issues that are unique to a certain group of people, such as indigenous communities. These perspectives suggest that national boundaries are essential to promote peace and cooperation, and that perhaps the issue lies not with the concept itself, but with how it is perceived and used.\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are a social construct that has been used for centuries, with its origins dating back to Europe's religious wars as well as the period of colonialism. It is a matter of abstraction that has led to discrimination, unequal power structures and xenophobic attitudes. While there are arguments for its necessity, it is important to recognise and address its negative implications, such as the displacement and mistreatment of refugees.

The ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict, for instance, is rooted in the creation of a Jewish state in majority-Muslim Palestine.\nFurthermore, in the age of globalisation, the idea of a national economy is also becoming less relevant. The world has become increasingly interconnected, and economic activities do not respect national borders. Companies operate worldwide, and currencies fluctuate based on international markets. The rise of supranational organisations such as the United Nations and European Union also challenges the idea of national sovereignty and boundaries. However, this may not necessarily be a good thing \u2013 international organisations may not always serve the interests of smaller, poorer countries that are already marginalised in the global economic system.\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are ultimately a social construct, perpetuated by historical legacy and power structures. While they may have some practical uses such as administering law and order within a defined territory, the reality is that national boundaries are arbitrary and have been used to exclude and oppress. It is thus important to recognise the limitations of the nation-state in an interconnected world, but also to acknowledge the real challenges of building alternative systems that are inclusive and equitable.",

National boundaries also draw on a sense of nationalism that ultimately pits one country against another in conflicts and wars. Even though the heads of states might shake hands and sign peace treaties, no one can fully guarantee the absence of any future hostilities.\nOverall, the idea of a nation is a social construct that has become a powerful force in the shaping of our identity and our world. While it may have been necessary in the past, now the idea creates more harm than good. The globalized nature of economics, politics, and society shows that it is essential to think beyond national boundaries.

Climate change, economic inequality, and cyber security are all issues that require international cooperation to be tackled effectively. The current COVID-19 pandemic is also a stark reminder that viruses do not respect national boundaries and that we are indeed all interconnected. The use of national boundaries as a means of defence and control may not be enough to stop the problem at its source, but rather it requires collaborative and comprehensive measures across borders.\n\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are a social construct that has been used for various purposes throughout history, some of which has led to the oppression of certain groups of people. The global age has brought with it new challenges that require solutions beyond national boundaries, and it is essential that we recognise our interconnectedness as a global community.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ve in this argument thus call the process \"en-skilling\" instead of \"de-skilling\".\nOn the other hand, technological advancement is also not only forcing individuals to change jobs, but also allowing them to juggle multiple careers at the same time. The \"gig economy\" is the term for this new phenomenon. The gig economy or sharing economy allows people to make use of technology to optimise the use of their resources, whether tangible like car seats or intangible like time and creativity. Grab and Youtube are two classic examples of empowering individuals to have another side job that can become as well-paying as their mainstream job. These sharing platforms \u2013 whether to share car rides or to share videos \u2013 allow people to make a market from their skills. As P.J. Abdul Kalam said, \"the youth today need to be enabled to become job generators from job seekers.\" This is also necessarily a negative trend because having multiple careers empower individuals to do what they actually enjoy and are passionate about. Leaving the typical nine-to-five working lifestyle for a freelancing manner of getting employment has become increasingly more popular amongst young people, with over half of workers below 24 in France, Germany, Italy and Spain on fixed-term contracts rather than the traditional long term ones. Loyalty to companies is also less important to individuals who want job flexibility and autonomy over the jobs they do. Thus, technological advancement which has opened up the possibilities for flexible and new jobs has made young people consider job satisfaction and autonomy to be more important than job stability. As the saying goes, \"If you do what you love, you never have to work for a day\". It seems that the younger generation today are particularly believers of this.\nOf course, there are again exceptions, particularly for those who commit themselves to a particular skill or sport. David Beckham once said that \"I treat my job as a hobby. It'ssomething I love doing.\"  For those highly passionate about their choice of employment, a single career is probably the only thing they can envision themselves doing. After all, for particular occupations, more years really do mean becoming better at the job. Other than athletes who will not benefit from switching sports every two years should they want to be at the top of their game, other occupations which require years of dedication include those which are artisanal in nature. For example, leather crafters or tailors are people whose skills get refined over time, making them better at the job as they stay in the career longer. These are also jobs which fundamentally defy technological disruption. A good sportsman is considered good precisely because he is meant to stretch the potential of what a human can do, rather than being aided by machines. Art and artisanal products are precious and valued because they are made by people and thus unique, rather than being standardised and mass produced. Hence, there is still a place for these careers in our economy, and these careers, when performed by the very best and the committees, usually span a lifetime.\nUltimately, the idea of work and how work is done are always undergoing changes. Save for a few, a single career is not only unrealistic, but also unfulfilling and unproductive. Instead of trying to force oneself to commit to a single career, it is more important that people find work meaningful for themselves as well as for society \u2013 whether in a single career or multiple ones.",

If they are not tied to a single career path, they have the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests, rather than simply pursuing financial stability or status. Moreover, individuals may find they have a greater sense of control over their professional development and career trajectory.\n\nAnother implication of this shift is the need for a focus on lifelong learning.

People are not willing to remain in jobs that they find unfulfilling just because it seems like the \"safe\" option. This is particularly true for millennials who, according to a Gallup poll, are the least engaged group in the workforce. They go into jobs with specific expectations of what they want their work to be like, and if those expectations are not met, they are not afraid to leave. The freedom to leave also depends on the job market. Where the job market is tight, it is much harder for people to leave their jobs.

After all, one's profession is often an important source of identity and self-worth. To \"job-hop\" may be seen as neglecting one's identity, or even betraying the calling to which one has dedicated much of one's life. Similarly, the push to work in a variety of occupations may not suit people with personality types that prefer routine or certainty.\nIn conclusion, a single career for life is unlikely to be desirable for most workers in today's age of rapid technological advancement. However, there are exceptions to which technology will not completely replace jobs, or where individuals may prefer specialisation. For the majority of workers, the need to upskill and switch careers to remain relevant will become the norm.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ue. However, in a study examining economic inequality, it is discovered that economic growth does not have a direct correlation with income inequality. It is rather the policies put in place which affect the pathways in which economic growth contributes to, or mitigates, income inequality. Countries like Nigeria which are wealthy but do not invest in education and welfare lag behind, but many wealthy countries such as Sweden do see much lower income inequality. Thus, the blame lies not in continuous economic growth, but rather on inequitable policies.\nLastly, economic growth has been painted as the main driver of climate change problems, and this is for good reason. The rapid industrialization which led to exponential economic growth also caused an exponential increase in carbon emissions, driving our world towards ecological doom. And developing countries which wish to continue to grow their economy are going to follow in the footsteps of developed ones through generating carbon emissions as they power their manufacturing plants and burn fossil fuels. Other environmental harm is also caused in the process of generating economic growth, such as pollution of water bodies by manufacturing plants, the destruction of biodiversity due to overfishing and oil spills. However, there is a sliver of hope amidst all this doom and gloom \u2013 the concept of decoupling economic growth from fossil fuels is growing to promote green growth, which is economic growth that is also environmentally sustainable. For example, there has been increasing investment in renewable energy such as solar energy, particularly in developing places like Africa. Under the New Deal on Energy, more and more of the continent'sinvestment into energy infrastructure have been directed towards solar energy projects, which will emit less carbon emissions while still powering the economy. Hence, continuous economic growth, coupled with proper environmental policies, is needed and desirable for further development.\nYet, it is also crucial to note that income inequality and environmental issues both threaten the continuity of economic growth in turn. The former causes social instability which can lead to the collapse of regimes such as seen during Arab Spring, while the latter can also threaten it, as it causes disruptions to food supply or destroy existing infrastructure. In fact, with most economic activities concentrated on coastal cities around the world, coastal flooding and sea level rises will pose a huge threat to economic growth in those regions and the world. Thus, even for those who agree that economic growth must remain a priority, it must also happen in tandem with more equitable distribution as well as environmental protection. This is not impossible, as shown previously, through far-sighted and balanced policies.\nUltimately, economic growth is desirable because human well-being is desirable. It is thus hopeful that as humanity has learnt lessons on how economic growth, if unchecked, can threaten our initial goals, that it is important to choose a different path where all three kinds of sustainability \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 are emphasized. This is why, if taken to the true sense of the word, continuous economic growth will be desirable, since it will also have to be sustainable.",

While economic growth can create job opportunities and increase incomes for some individuals, it can also exacerbate income inequality and leave some individuals behind. This is particularly true in developing countries, where economic growth can often disproportionately benefit a small subset of the population.\n\nFurthermore, the pursuit of economic growth can often come at the expense of social and political freedoms. For example, countries that prioritize economic growth may be more likely to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression in order to maintain stability and ensure that economic growth remains uninterrupted.\n\nGiven these drawbacks, it is clear that continuous economic growth is not an entirely desirable goal. Instead, it is important to prioritize sustainable economic development that considers broader social, environmental, and political concerns. This means that economic growth should be pursued in a way that does not harm the environment or exacerbate economic inequality, and that prioritizes public goods and services that improve the overall quality of life for individuals and communities.\n\nOne way to achieve this is through the adoption of more sustainable economic models, such as circular economies, which prioritize resource efficiency and waste reduction. Additionally, investment in renewable energy and other sustainable technologies can help reduce the negative environmental impact of economic growth, while also creating job opportunities and promoting economic stability.\n\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of continuous economic growth has some merit, it is important to consider the drawbacks and limitations of this goal.

When income inequality increases, many social ills inevitably follow, such as political instability, crime rates and social exclusion, contributing to the erosion of social trust and ultimately, undermining long-term sustainable development. Therefore, economic growth needs to be balanced with the distribution of wealth, or else the benefits of growth will only accrue to a small minority. This means that the government has to intervene in the market, through progressive taxation or even redistributive policies, to ensure that no one is left behind.\nBut economic growth cannot be achieved at the cost of the environment. The World Wildlife Fund's Living Planet Report revealed that the planet's biodiversity has declined by 60% since 1970, and that climate change and unsustainable production and consumption patterns are seen as the main culprits. The idea that growth means that the environment has to inevitably suffer is being challenged by the concept of sustainable growth. Sustainable growth involves the development of production technologies and business models that are environmentally sustainable in the long run. Green growth, or the promotion of environmentally-friendly industries and the increased use of renewable energy, is one example of this. Although there is much debate on whether economic growth and environmental sustainability can ever co-exist, it is clear that continued, unchecked consumption without regard for environmental externalities is leading us down the path of no return.\nThus, while economic growth still remains the singular measure of economic success, it should not be pursued blindly. Growth does not guarantee wealth or prosperity, nor does it guarantee environmental sustainability, or even equity. Instead, a more nuanced approach to economic growth should be taken, one in which a balance is achieved between economic growth and social and environmental needs, so that growth truly translates into progress and a better quality of life.",

This can lead to social unrest and political instability, as people begin to feel left out of the economic story despite the overall growth of the economy. Furthermore, economic growth has been linked to environmental degradation and pollution. While economic growth can lead to improvements in reducing environmental impact per unit of output, it still increases the overall amount of industrial activity, which leads to more emissions and pollution. Climate change, for example, is linked to rising levels of carbon emissions from economic activity, which can have severe consequences for the planet's ecosystems.\n\nNonetheless, it is crucial to note that all these points do not necessarily mean that economic growth should be abandoned. Rather, economic growth must be balanced with other goals such as environmental sustainability and social justice. This can be achieved through policies such as taxation and income redistribution to reduce inequality, and investments in renewable energy and carbon capture technologies. Inclusion policies can also be designed to bring rural areas up to speed with urban areas. In the context of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), economic growth is still a necessary component of development but must go hand in hand with other sustainable development goals such as SDG 13 on climate action and SDG 10 on reduced inequality. This can create a virtuous cycle where economic growth is not pursued at all costs, but instead, sustainable development is the goal.",

This has implications for social cohesion and stability because where inequality is high, social conflicts usually follow. Thus, we need to be aware of the limitations of economic growth as an end in itself, and the need for redistributive policies and social safety nets to mitigate the negative consequences of income inequality.\nFurthermore, we must also recognize that the pursuit of economic growth usually comes at a cost to the environment. This externality can be seen to be a market failure because the production of goods and services is usually done at the expense of natural resources, and the cost of this depletion is not accounted for in the economic growth equation. This debate is especially poignant in the face of climate change. The Paris Agreement signed by countries to reduce carbon emissions is meant to address this, but it remains to be seen how feasible and effective it can be. Growth and sustainability are not necessarily incompatible, however. There is increasing pressure for businesses and governments to adopt sustainable practices, and we are starting to see a shift towards a more environmentally friendly direction in the global economy.\nIn conclusion, while it is easy to conclude that continuous economic growth is an unequivocal goal for society, we must appreciate the nuances of economic growth in relation to human development, income inequality, and environmental sustainability. Rather than pursuit of growth at all costs, policymakers should consider redistributive policies to address social and economic inequalities, and ensure that any economic growth is environmentally sustainable. Economic growth is essential for development, but we need to be wise about how we pursue it.",

This poses a significant challenge in achieving inclusive economic growth, where the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared amongst all segments of society.\nMoreover, the pursuit of economic growth can also come at a significant environmental cost. The extraction of natural resources, the burning of fossil fuels and the release of carbon emissions have led to climate change, pollution, loss of biodiversity and other unsustainable practices. The world's consumption of natural resources is running at 1.7 times the rate that the Earth's ecosystems can regenerate, which means that we are using up the planet's resources faster than they can be replenished. The external environmental costs of economic growth, if not addressed, can lead to irreversible damage to the planet, threatening the very sustainability of economic growth itself in the long term.\nIn conclusion, while economic growth has brought about significant improvements in human well-being, challenges such as income inequality and environmental degradation cannot be ignored. Economic growth must be pursued with sustainable development in mind, and stakeholders must be engaged in finding ways to mitigate the negative effects of economic growth. Governments can implement policies to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are equitably shared, and companies can adopt sustainable practices to minimize their negative impact on the environment. By doing so, we can ensure that economic growth can continue to be a force for progress, rather than a source of harm.",
                "ue as well. Studies have shown that income inequality can drive people to be less motivated and more politically and socially unstable. Furthermore, income inequality can lead to a gap in education levels as well, since children from low-income families generally lack the resources to access the education and healthcare needed to succeed in life. Hence, there is a need to find a balance between maintaining economic growth and ensuring social justice.\nLastly, unchecked economic growth can also lead to significant environmental costs. As economies grow, so does the rate of resource consumption and pollution, resulting in damage to the ecosystem, climate change, and the depletion of natural resources. This can have severe consequences on the economy and society in the long run. To mitigate these risks, the discourse today emphasizes the need for green development, which essentially aims to ensure that economic growth is sustainable and circular in nature, using renewable resources and minimizing pollution and resource depletion. To achieve this, many governments have implemented policies to encourage green development, such as the carbon pricing system, which sets a price on carbon emissions to discourage industries from producing high levels of pollution and to encourage investment in green technology.\nIn conclusion, while economic growth is essential for the prosperity of nations, it must be pursued with caution. Economic growth does not necessarily lead to social justice and environmental sustainability and thus policymakers must be wary of the unintended consequences of economic growth. Ultimately, inclusive and sustainable economic growth is needed to ensure a future where economic prosperity, social equity, and environmental sustainability are in balance.",

Economic growth has led to the development of companies and markets, which have created amazing wealth for some individuals and corporations, but at the expense of others who may have been left behind in low-paying jobs. Moreover, the resources consumed and environmental debts incurred by companies may be shifting to future generations through climate change or depletion of non-renewable resources, which threaten the sustainability of economic growth itself.\n\nGiven the drawbacks of pursuing economic growth, how then can we maintain economic growth that is socially and environmentally sustainable? One way is through fostering inclusive growth that benefits all members of society. This can be achieved when the resources generated from economic growth are invested socially, such as in education, healthcare, and infrastructure, to reduce inequalities and create opportunities for all. The development of a skills base of the workforce through education would empower people to participate more fully in the economy while closing the wealth gap. The government should also consider investing in programmes that encourage low-carbon growth and a circular economy to mitigate climate change risks and resource depletion.\n\nIn conclusion, economic growth should not be pursued at all costs but instead be accompanied by social and environmental sustainability. It is essential to strike a balance between growth, human development, and economic sustainability. Economic growth can create wealth, create jobs, and increase prosperity, but it should not come at the expense of future generations and the planet. Governments and corporations need to pursue strategies that enable individuals and society to enjoy the benefits of economic growth, especially the poor and marginalized segments of society, while harnessing technology and innovation to mitigate the negative impacts on the environment.",

It is argued that the prevailing system of capitalism prioritizes profits and wealth accumulation over social values, leading to an impoverishment of social cooperation and harm to the environment in the long run.\n\nAdditionally, it has become clear that economic growth at all costs comes with a hefty environmental cost. Economic growth often involves the extraction of natural resources and the emission of a great amount of waste, which leads to air and water pollution, deforestation, and climate change. The degradation of the natural environment has tremendous consequences for human health, leading to respiratory problems, deadly air pollution, and water scarcity. Therefore, the pursuit of economic growth must also factor in ecological sustainability and balance economic development with environmental concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, economic growth has been widely accepted as a way to promote human development and improve people'swell-being. However, it is becoming increasingly concerning that this growth is not being distributed equally, leading to social injustice and environmental degradation. Therefore, it is essential that policymakers prioritize inclusive and sustainable economic growth while mitigating the negative effects that come with it. The ultimate goal of economic growth should be to improve the lives of people in a just and environmentally sustainable way.",

The bottom 10% of households in Singapore according to household income from work earns less than $1,500 per month, while the top 10% earns more than $31,000. This is a worrying trend as income inequality not only undermines social cohesion but also reduces motivation to work and improve, which can lead to lower economic growth.\n\nFurthermore, economic growth has been shown to have external environmental costs, which can lead to the depletion of natural resources and pollution. For example, the industrial revolution in the 19th century significantly improved standards of living, but it also led to significant pollution in urban areas, including London and Manchester, with some of the smog so thick that visibility was reduced to only a few feet, leading to premature deaths. Similarly, the depletion of natural resources through overfishing and unplanned urbanisation can lead to long-term negative environmental impacts, such as loss of biodiversity and increased climate change. These issues are particularly pertinent in developing countries where short-term economic growth is prioritised over long-term sustainable development.\n\nIn conclusion, economic growth can be both desirable and undesirable for society, depending on how it is managed. While economic growth has led to significant improvements in people's well-being, it has also led to income inequality and external environmental costs. Thus, a balance needs to be struck between economic growth and social and environmental sustainability for economic growth to truly benefit society and the world.",

This also contributes to social injustice \u2013 where the inequality of resources means that opportunities are not equally spread around for everyone to have a fair chance. The situation is further compounded by a lack of social mobility in many countries, which means that people born into poor families tend to stay in that same socio-economic status for their entire lives. This creates a feedback loop where lack of resources leads to less development and fewer opportunities, which in turn contributes to more inequality and social injustice down the line.\nDespite these drawbacks, it is hard to deny that economic growth is still largely necessary for the sustainability of a country's economy and even the world. It is imperative for governments and corporations to move towards a sustainable model of growth that does not actively damage the environment or leave behind a social disaster. Sustainable growth is an approach to development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. This means that there is a need to balance economic growth with environmental and social sustainability. For example, there needs to be investment and innovation into alternative energy to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, as well as policies to address income inequality and social injustice. Such a move towards sustainable growth would position countries to be resilient and prosperous in the long-term.\nIn conclusion, while economic growth is largely desirable for the well-being of citizens, it is important to acknowledge that it comes with accompanying drawbacks if pursued without any regard for social and environmental sustainability. It is imperative that governments and corporations move towards a more sustainable model of growth that is equally mindful of economic, environmental, and social indicators as they continue to chart a course for future progress.",

In fact, the top 1% of earners in Singapore made up almost a quarter of the country's total income in 2019, according to a report by Credit Suisse. Income inequality is not only a matter of social injustice but also a threat to sustainable economic growth, as it leads to a less harmonious society and less economic activity overall. When the majority of income and wealth are concentrated in the hands of a few, it limits the consumption and investment capacity of others, which in turn affects the overall growth of the economy.\nAnother issue with the traditional concept of economic growth is that it carries an environmental cost that is often not factored in. Economic activities that contribute to growth, such as industrial production, transportation, and energy consumption, also produce harmful emissions and pollutants, which lead to environmental degradation. Climate change, loss of biodiversity, and air and water pollution are all consequences of economic activities that contribute to GDP growth. Environmental degradation can, in turn, lead to social and economic costs, such as loss of productivity due to illnesses associated with environmental pollution or the impact on tourism due to degraded natural environments. Therefore, sustaining economic growth in the long run requires a balance between economic development and environmental protection, and continued growth that does not account for environmental costs is unsustainable.\nIn conclusion, economic growth has many desirable benefits such as improvements in people'swell-being, but if it is pursued at all costs, it can lead to several adverse effects such as income inequality and environmental degradation. A balance between economic development and social and environmental sustainability must be achieved to achieve sustainable economic growth in the long run."

            "human_gen_truncate": "xperiences, trial and error, and of course, failures. It can thus be seen that anything innovative in this world must have taken several failures before they can fully materialise and be successful.\nBesides, failure not only allows one to improve in terms of skills specific to one'sgoals, but also develops one'scharacter which is crucial to success. Characteristics like grit, resilience and determination are developed through accepting and making the best out of failure. Many people fail not just for a particular moment, but for an extended period of time, which further tests their resilience. A noteworthy example would be J.K. Rowling who was living on welfare and suffered from her mother'sdeath, a miscarriage and an abusive marriage for seven years after leaving university before the Harry Potter series was published. However, it was also during these seven years that Rowling continuously worked on Harry Potter. Being a \"failure\" did not stop her from trying to achieve success, which she eventually did.\nInterestingly, failure is also an essential part of success even after one has succeeded. As Ellen DeGeneres puts it, \"It'sfailure that gives you the proper perspective on success.\". Someone who has never failed before will take success for granted, as if it is a given. These are the people who will not be able to maintain success for long, akin to wealthy heirs who never knew how difficult it is to earn money and thus squander all their inheritance away. The example of Steve Jobs can help to illustrate this. Jobs was pretty successful until he got ousted from his company by the other stakeholders, making him question if he was a good leader before that. Luckily for Jobs, this was not the end for him, and he quickly bounced back and ultimately regained control of his company again, taking it to greater heights. After this failure, Jobs would never take his success for granted again, for he knows its precarity. This understanding of its precarity also makes success taste sweeter and that much more precious, illustrating how the experience of past failures can contribute to a richer sense of success in future. This appreciation of one'spast failures also makes those who are successful more giving. Coming back to the example of J.K. Rowling, due to her own experiences being in poverty, she gave back to charity tremendously when she became the world'sfirst billionaire author, specifically contributing to anti-poverty and children welfare causes.\nIn summary, failure is indubitably an essential part of success, considering how it is not only inevitable but can be constructive for one'ssuccess. Being afraid of, or avoiding, failure can ironically prevent one from accessing true success. It is then of no wonder that people who have failed then succeeded do not mind sharing about their past failures, because they truly believe that ultimately it is their failures which have helped them get to where they are today.",

Failure can be humbling and provide the drive needed to succeed. Individuals who have failed in the past are often more motivated and determined to succeed than those who have not faced any setbacks. The famous author J.K. Rowling, for instance, was rejected by numerous publishers before her book, Harry Potter, was accepted. Her failures motivated her to keep going, and she eventually became one of the best-selling authors of all time.\n\nFurthermore, failure provides us with the opportunity to re-evaluate our goals and priorities. The experience of failure allows us to reflect on what we really want in life, what we are willing to sacrifice to achieve our goals, and what is truly important to us. This introspection helps individuals develop a clear sense of purpose and motivation, which is essential for success. Therefore, failure is not only an integral part of the journey towards success, but it is also an opportunity for self-discovery and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, while failure may seem like a setback, it is an integral part of success. Failure teaches us valuable lessons, helps us grow, builds our resilience, provides us with motivation, and allows us to re-evaluate our goals and priorities. Therefore, we must embrace failure and recognize it as a stepping stone towards success. As the famous motivational speaker, Zig Ziglar once said, \u201cFailure is not a single, cataclysmic event.

It provides opportunities to learn from mistakes, develop necessary skills, and transform ordinary individuals into extraordinary achievers. Success without failure is a mere fluke, and has no real value or meaning.

When one experiences failure, it is often accompanied by the sense of defeat and despair. However, this sense of loss, of trying and not succeeding, makes the eventual success all the more powerful and special. This is why people often recount their struggles, their failures, and their eventual victory, because it is only in the face of failure that the human spirit is truly tested, and prevailed over. It is often said that it is not whether one wins or loses, but how one plays the game. Failure is just a part of the game, and ultimately, the joy of success, when it is achieved, is immeasurable.\nIn conclusion, failure is indeed an essential component of success. It helps one to learn from mistakes, to innovate, and to accumulate knowledge to succeed in the future. Failure allows people to experience the bumps along the road, but ultimately leads to greater wisdom and knowledge. It also makes the success that much sweeter, as one understands the effort and the difficulties that went into it.

It is only when we face adversity head on, pick ourselves up after falling, and keep pressing forward despite the odds that we finally reach our goal. This journey can be long and arduous, but the reward at the end of the journey is also that much sweeter.\nTherefore, while failure may initially seem like a hindrance to success, it is important to recognize that failure is an essential part of the process of success. It helps individuals grow, learn from their mistakes, and develop the skills necessary to ultimately succeed. Success without the prospect of failure is hollow and lacks the meaningful accomplishments that come from facing adversity and ultimately triumphing over it.

People who have faced failures are also more likely to appreciate the success they have achieved, and to work harder to maintain it once they have it.\nIn conclusion, failure is an essential part of success because it allows one to develop the necessary skills for success, to go beyond what others have done before, and to give success a greater sense of meaning. Without experiencing failure, one cannot fully appreciate the effort and perseverance required to achieve success. Hence, as individuals and as a society, we should embrace failure as a natural part of the process towards success."

            "human_gen_truncate": " boasts the highest reoffense rate in the world at 76 percent. Evidently, prisons are only effective in reforming their inmates if efforts go towards rehabilitative rather than retributive justice.\nAdditionally, if prisons are able to reduce recidivism and control the size of prison populations, they are likely to be more successful in preventing the growth of criminal networks based in prisons. Prison gangs and criminal networks often arise as a rational response to poor conditions within burdened prison systems \u2013 the Californian prison system has about 160,000 inmates, and on average holds a few thousand in each prison. In such a system, there is a large black market for illicit goods, and understaffed prison administrations are unable to provide law and order. This creates the conditions for the growth of prison gangs like the notorious Mexican Mafia, which control life both inside and outside these prisons. In contrast, the Scandinavian prison systems minimize the number of inmates held in each facility, and have reported lower occurrences of criminal organisations fomenting within prisons.\nAt the same time, it must be noted that incarceration often drastically changes communities in ways which might foment crime in the long-term. Prisons will only be effective in preventing crime if they cooperate with external agencies to address the effects of imprisonment on the community. Studies have shown that the children of incarcerated parents tend to move frequently, face financial problems from a young age, struggle with emotional and family instability. Communities with high levels of mass incarceration tend to perpetuate that cycle since incarceration disrupts important social and family structures and roles. Partners which provide support services, such as the Kids in Play programme run by the Salvation Army in Singapore, are able to mitigate these impacts and break the cycle of violence and crime.\nIn conclusion, prisons are only effective in combating crime if they are able to address the root causes of crime, if sufficient resources are diverted to counselling convicts and preparing them for a life outside prison, and if they are able to prevent the agglomeration of criminal networks. This is because their effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of whether they are able to prevent crime from occurring in the long-term. With the right support for criminals who have demonstrated the ability to turn over a new leaf, prisons will be able to prevent crime for good, as criminals are often pushed to reoffend if they are unable to meet their social or economic needs after leaving prison. This often has a positive impact on communities, who may be left with a \"social vacuum\" if convicts are not rehabilitated and the impact of mass incarceration is not mitigated. If prisons are able to prevent the growth of criminal networks, they will be better able to prevent the vicious cycle of crime from perpetuating itself.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " offenders end up committing more crimes due to the influence of fellow inmates within overcrowded facilities, making prisons breeding grounds for crime.\n\nFurthermore, imprisonment puts a strain on the financial resources of states. The cost of maintaining prisons is high, and it is not always effective in reducing crime. In the United States, for instance, the cost of imprisoning a person for a year is approximately $31,286. This cost can be better used in establishing sustainable rehabilitation programs that can help reduce the rate of recidivism. These programs would prepare former inmates to be reintegrated into society; thus, reducing their reliance on social welfare and increasing the chances of them becoming useful members of society.\n\nAdditionally, extended periods of prison sentences for non-violent offenses only lead to overcrowding in prisons. In many cases, the length of imprisonment is not proportional to the offense committed. Non-violent offenses such as minor drug charges lead to disproportionate imprisonment sentences. This not only leads to prison overcrowding but also results in a higher rate of recidivism as the offenders may become influenced by hardened criminals within the prison system.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of how effective prisons are in addressing the problem of crime is a complex one. Imprisonment alone is not sufficient to deal with the problem of crime. Therefore, rehabilitation programs should be an integrated approach that should be used to address recidivism and reduce the cost of maintaining prisons. Offenders should receive counseling services, medical care, and skills to be able to reintegrate back into society. This approach would have a positive impact on the criminal justice system by reducing recidivism rates while saving taxpayers' money. Prisons should not only serve as deterrents to would-be offenders but also be centers for change and rehabilitation.",

                "has a recidivism rate of 77 percent in 5 years, indicating that the United States prison system is not geared towards rehabilitation but punishment. \n\nMoreover, prisons are only effective in mitigating crime if resources are diverted towards rehabilitation rather than punishment. The success of rehabilitation programmes depends heavily on the funding of programs to meet the needs of inmates. In the United States, for-profit prisons rely on filling beds with inmates, who are subjected to overcrowding, violence, and unsanitary living conditions. In contrast, Singapore's emphasis on rehabilitation implies that it only houses as many convicts as can be effectively rehabilitated. Singapore also has a robust education system that extends to inmates which includes vocational training, literacy programs and job placement assistance, all aimed to help equip inmates with the tools they need to successfully reintegrate into society.\n\nSmall prisons are also effective in reducing recidivism. Large prisons contribute to the formation of criminal networks. When inmates are grouped together and made to interact in large numbers, it contributes to the formation of gangs, business networks, and drug cartels. The bigger the prison, the more opportunities these criminal networks have to form. Small prisons, on the other hand, are more effective at facilitating rehabilitation, providing inmates with more individualized programmes to cater to their specific needs. Examples include the Macquarie Correctional Centre in Australia, which has 54 beds and a staff to inmate ratio of 1:6, and the Bastoy prison in Norway, which has a capacity of 115 inmates and a staff to inmate ratio of 1:0.6.\n\nLastly, mass incarceration has deleterious effects on communities surrounding prisons and the country at large. Communities that have high levels of incarceration have a lack of opportunity for employment and feel socially isolated. Mass incarceration also disproportionately affects communities of colour. This contributes to institutionalised racism that has tangible effects, such as discrimination in employment and housing. Recidivism rates amongst minority groups are also far higher than those of non-minorities, indicating a lack of accessibility and quality of rehabilitation programmes in prisons. This shows that prisons must focus on rehabilitation, and sentencing policies must be adjusted to address institutionalised racism within the criminal justice system.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that prisons are only effective in mitigating crime if they are centred on rehabilitation programmes and resources that cater to the specific needs of the inmates. Small prisons, coupled with diversified, individualized programs, have been seen to be more effective in curbing recidivism, and large-scale incarceration is futile in reducing crime rates. Mass incarceration also has deleterious effects on communities' well-being and exacerbates institutionalized racism. It is hence crucial for prisons to shift their focus from punishment to rehabilitation and for policymakers to recognize the importance of addressing the root causes of crime when sentencing offenders.",
                ", has higher rates of recidivism. By focusing on rehabilitation, prisons can provide convicts with the skills and knowledge necessary to re-enter society, and tackle the root causes of the crime \u2013 whether it be drug addiction, unemployment, or under-education.\nAnother factor that affects the effectiveness of prisons is the size of the prison itself. Large prisons run the risk of turning into hubs for criminal networks, with prisoners forming alliances for mutual protection or to form new connections on the outside. These networks perpetuate the cycle of crime and defeat the purpose of rehabilitation. However, smaller prison systems demonstrate better outcomes for the rehabilitation of prisoners. Norway, for instance, has one of the world's smallest prison populations, at just over 3,000, but the lowest recidivism rate in Europe, at 20 percent. The prisons are designed to look like schools or apartments and are equipped with workshops, kitchens, and outdoor spaces. The small size limits the formation of criminal networks, while the comfortable environment promotes trust and socialisation. In Singapore, while there is no specific data on the correlation between prison size and recidivism, there has been a trend towards smaller community-based prisons in recent years to allow for more personalised rehabilitation plans.\nLastly, prison systems must also mitigate the negative impact that mass incarceration has on communities. A 2018 report by the Prison Policy Institute revealed that the United States has both the highest incarceration rate and the highest rate of income inequality among Western democracies. Mass incarceration tends to affect low-income communities disproportionately, as parents are taken away from their families, deteriorating family structures and causing a sense of hopelessness that breeds crime in communities. In Singapore, where income inequality is less pronounced, the prison system promotes family visitation and encourages communication between prisoners and their families, as well as maintaining the right of prisoners to vote. These policies help to ensure the social cohesion of communities and provides convicts with a sense of belonging and responsibility.\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prison systems depends on multiple factors, including the nature of the crime, the focus on rehabilitation, prison size, and the impact on communities. If prisons are able to tackle these criteria effectively, then they can be considered successful in reducing the rate of crime in society. However, if prisons continue to function as mere punishments without addressing the root causes of crime or provide rehabilitation, then they will only perpetuate the cycle of crime in society.",
                ", has higher recidivism rates.\nHowever, even if prisons do succeed in rehabilitating criminals, the growth of criminal networks in prisons is a common problem that undoes any successful rehabilitation efforts. To prevent such growth, prisons must maintain a small critical size, keeping the number of inmates small enough such that the prison culture cannot overwhelm individuals. This has been difficult to achieve in the United States, where the private prison industry and political expediency encourage maximum occupancy. The result, as French sociologist Michel Foucault observed, is that prisons become \"recruitment centers for the army of crime\" as former prisoners with limited opportunities for reemployment inevitably return to criminal networks or gangs. The overcrowding of prisons also breeds resentment at the failure of the authorities to protect prisoners' safety, leading to violent clashes between inmates, and leading to the spread of disease, as seen with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nFinally, the act of imprisoning also has long-lasting negative impacts on communities, not just on individual prisoners. It imposes social and economic costs on the families and communities of incarcerated individuals. Research has shown that imprisonment leads to lower educational attainment, labour market prospects, lower income, and decreased household wealth. Furthermore, penal policies that disproportionately imprison certain communities, such as low-income communities and communities of colour, are also likely to exacerbate pre-existing social inequalities. This results in the creation of \"crime-prone\" areas where the risk of recidivism and criminal activities are concentrated, perpetuating a cycle of crime, incarceration, and social strife\nIn conclusion, it is clear that imprisonment alone is limited in its ability to address the problem of crime. If we want to achieve better rehabilitation and reduce the numbers of individuals who commit crimes and reoffend, our approach needs to be more holistic. We must address the root causes of crime, focus on more effective rehabilitation strategies, maintain smaller-sized prisons, and mitigate the long-term negative impacts that imprisonment has on our communities.",
                "produces high recidivism rates. This highlights the importance of diverting resources to meaningful rehabilitation programmes within prisons, as well as the importance of understanding that the root causes of crime are not just a matter of individual character flaws, but structural problems in society.\nIn addition, prisons must be able to maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks within the facility. Overcrowding in prisons creates an environment where power dynamics mimic those of the outside world, with fear and violence becoming a means for survival and advancement. This dynamic could create conditions where imprisoned individuals learn to survive through crime, as well as form long-term criminal connections. Furthermore, overcrowded prisons threaten the mental and physical well-being of inmates, which can negatively affect not only their own progress towards rehabilitation but also their likelihood to reoffend once released. Therefore, policymakers must reconsider the way they approach sentencing policies to avoid contributing to overcrowding, and instead provide alternative sanctions such as community service or electronic monitoring.\nLastly, mass incarceration has a detrimental effect on society as a whole, and this has been widely documented. Firstly, it disproportionately affects certain racial and ethnic groups, and secondly, it reinforces a culture of punishment over rehabilitation. This, in turn, perpetuates the cycle of crime in communities. Research has shown that when parents (particularly fathers) are incarcerated, it can have numerous negative consequences for their children, including reduced academic achievement, poorer mental and physical health, as well as behaviour problems. This ultimately increases the likelihood that children of incarcerated parents will themselves end up incarcerated in the future. Therefore, policymakers must consider the long-term impact of mass incarceration on society and adopt policies that address the root causes of crime, rather than resort to a knee-jerk reaction of over-punishing offenders.\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in reducing crime rates is conditional upon its ability to properly reform criminals, divert resources into rehabilitation programmes, maintain a small critical size, and consider the long-term impact incarceration has on society. Only then can imprisonment be seen as a worthwhile measure to mitigate crime rates.",
                "has a higher recidivism rate. As such, diverting resources towards rehabilitation as opposed to solely punitive measures is necessary to ensure the effectiveness of imprisonment in mitigating crime.\nMoreover, prisons must also maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks, which can further perpetuate crime in the long term. Overcrowding in prisons creates an environment where prison gangs can thrive. According to a report by the National Institute of Justice, criminal gangs operate in almost every prison and have more than 80,000 members across the U.S. The prevalence of gangs impedes rehabilitation efforts, as inmates are susceptible to violence and exploitation by gangs in prisons. Furthermore, these gangs can continue their criminal activities even after the inmates are released back to the community, perpetuating crime in society.\nFinally, it is important to consider the impact that mass incarceration has on communities. When large numbers of people are incarcerated, families and entire communities can be devastated, leading to long-term economic and social consequences. Incarceration can worsen poverty and create significant hurdles to education and employment opportunities for individuals who have been incarcerated, leading to a vicious cycle of crime and recidivism. As such, it is important to ensure that only criminals who pose a significant threat to public safety are incarcerated, and that alternatives to imprisonment are explored when appropriate.\nIn conclusion, prisons are only effective in addressing the problem of crime if they are able to reform criminals and reduce the rates of recidivism. Imprisonment must be commensurate to the nature of the crime, and resources must be diverted towards rehabilitation. Additionally, prisons must maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks, and the impact of mass incarceration on communities must be considered. Only then can we hope to mitigate the problem of crime in society.",
                "has high recidivism rates. As such, it is important for prisons to allocate resources towards evidence-based rehabilitation programs tailored to the needs of their inmates, rather than subject them to a one-size-fits-all approach.\nIn addition, the success of imprisonment in mitigating crime rests on the critical size of its population. Prisons that exceed their critical size are more likely to foster criminal behaviours and exacerbate the social problems within prisons. For instance, the famous Stanford prison experiment conducted by Philip Zimbardo found that the participants who were assigned to the role of prison guards soon began to abuse their power and impose authoritarianism on the \"inmates\", creating an unhealthy and violent environment. Moreover, overcrowded prisons may lead to an increase in gang-related activities, violence and drug abuse. Therefore, it is necessary for prison authorities to maintain a smaller critical size, which can help to reduce the occurrence of such problems by improving the quality of life within the prisons. This can be achieved through the construction of smaller, community-based correctional facilities, where inmates receive more individualised attention from the guards and have greater access to educational programs and rehabilitation services.\nLastly, it is important for prisons to mitigate the impact that mass incarceration has on communities. Mass incarceration, or the large-scale imprisonment of individuals, has been shown to have adverse effects on the communities they come from. Apart from creating social and economic inequalities in these communities, mass incarceration can also perpetuate cycles of poverty and violence. Prison sentences may disrupt families and cause social stigma for ex-convicts, preventing them from reintegrating into society and seeking employment. In order to reduce these negative effects, it is important for prisons to facilitate re-entry into society by providing vocational training, job opportunities, and counselling services for ex-convicts. Additionally, governments and civil society should work together to reduce the number of people who are sent to prison for non-violent, low-level crimes in the first place, by exploring alternatives such as restorative justice, community service, and treatment programs.\nIn conclusion, while prisons can be effective in mitigating crime, this requires a more nuanced approach than simply locking up offenders. Prisons must be tailored to the needs of each individual offender to ensure that the root causes of their crimes are addressed. The prison population must be kept at a smaller critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks and ensure that inmates receive the attention they need. And finally, the impact of mass incarceration on communities must be mitigated by providing more support for ex-convicts to reintegrate into society. By adopting these measures, prisons can become more effective as a means to rehabilitate offenders and prevent recidivism, rather than simply being a source of punishment.",

This entails a redirection of resources towards education, mental health treatment, job training, and drug counselling so that criminals can tackle the root causes of their criminal behaviour, rather than simply punishing them for it.\nHowever, for prisons to work effectively, they must also be mindful of their size. When a prison becomes too large, it ceases to function as a corrective institution and instead replicates the same social inequalities and hierarchies that exist outside of the prison system. Large prisons make it harder for inmates to access vocational training and educational opportunities, while also increasing the risk of violence, riots, sexual violence, and gang activity. California's prison system offers a poignant example - the state's prison system became so overcrowded that the Supreme Court ruled in 2011 that the problem constituted cruel and unusual punishment, with inmates being squeezed into spaces designed for about half the number of people. Such harmful living conditions, in turn, make prisoners more likely to reoffend, particularly if they have been exposed to criminal networks during their time in prison.\nLastly, it is important to recognise the impact of mass incarceration policies on communities. When, en masse, a disproportionate number of black and Latino individuals are being incarcerated - 60% of the US prison population consists of individuals from either of these two groups - it disrupts the social fabric of these communities, with devastating consequences. Children, spouses and parents of incarcerated individuals are affected by the trauma, the loss of yearly income, and the disruption to social norms. Communities in which a sizeable portion of the men are incarcerated face a loss of social capital, increased adult mortality, and reduced tax bases. As a result, advocates for criminal justice reform stress the importance of reducing prison populations, developing alternative punitive measures, and ensuring that prison sentences are proportional to the crime committed.\nIn conclusion, prisons can be effective in reducing crime rates if the right measures are put in place. The prison must focus on rehabilitation, address the root causes of criminal behaviour, maintain a small critical size, and be cognisant of the impact of mass incarceration policies on communities. These measures ought to form the core of any criminal justice policy, so that we can ensure that our prisons are truly corrective institutions that lead to long-term reductions in crime.",
                "has a higher recidivism rate. This suggests that effective rehabilitation can only be achieved when resources are diverted towards addressing the root causes of crime. By providing education, vocational training, and therapy, prisons can equip inmates with the skills and mental fortitude to resist the pull of criminality.\nFurthermore, it is crucial for prisons to maintain a small critical size in order to prevent the growth of criminal networks. Prisons, in the context of a community, are prime locations for the fostering of criminal networks, which can cause long-lasting damage to the community even after the convicts are released. This is because they provide a means for criminals to network and exchange information even while they are incarcerated. An overcrowded prison system that houses too many inmates can easily lead to an increased likelihood of criminal networks forming. The implication of this is that when these offenders are released, the network that has formed in prison can continue to exist and ultimately result in an increased likelihood of the ex-convict to reoffend.\nFinally, prisons have to consider the impact of mass incarceration on communities in the long term. This is because mass incarceration tends to cause more harm than good to the communities where the prisoners come from. When inmates are incarcerated for an extended period of time, it removes them from their families, which in turn creates a destabilising effect on families and communities left behind. The communities, in turn, become vulnerable and often suffer from economic, social, and emotional deterioration because of the absence of the prisoners. When the prisoners are released, they tend to return to the communities they came from, and more often than not, they do so without the necessary support needed to reintegrate back into society.\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of imprisonment in mitigating crime is a complex and multifaceted issue. Success in rehabilitation can only be achieved when the root causes of criminal behaviour are addressed, resources are diverted toward reforming offenders, prisons maintain a small critical size, and the impact of mass incarceration is mitigated. Therefore, it is imperative for policymakers to reflect on these issues if imprisonment is to be an effective means of mitigating crime.",
                "has a recidivism rate as high as 77 percent. Countries that prioritize rehabilitation and education, however, such as Norway and Germany, have lower recidivism rates.\nMoreover, it is important for prisons to maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks within prisons. Mass incarceration has numerous negative effects on society, such as the fact that it disproportionately affects marginalized communities, promotes racial inequality, and creates a vicious cycle of poverty and desperation that is conducive to criminal behavior. In addition, when prisons become overcrowded, it becomes more difficult to cultivate a culture of rehabilitation, as the focus is on warehousing prisoners rather than reforming them. Additionally, overcrowding creates an environment that is ripe for the formation of gangs and criminal networks, leading to increased crime both within the prison and in the surrounding communities.\nFinally, it is important for prisons to mitigate the negative impact that mass incarceration has on communities. The families of prisoners often face financial difficulties when the sole breadwinner is incarcerated, and children who grow up with a parent in prison are more likely to engage in criminal behavior themselves. Furthermore, the recent trend of privatising prisons has led to the commodification of prisoners, where they are treated as a source of profit rather than as human beings. This not only incentivizes harsher sentences but also prioritises corporate profit over the public good.\nIn conclusion, while prisons can be effective in reducing crime rates, it is essential that they prioritize rehabilitation, maintain a small critical size, and mitigate the negative impact of mass incarceration on communities. To reduce crime rates in the long term, we must focus on addressing the root causes of crime, rather than solely relying on imprisonment as a means of deterrence.",
                "fails to rehabilitate inmates. \n\nHowever, even if prisons do focus on rehabilitation, there are still external factors which can impede the effectiveness of the prison system in lowering rates of crime. For example, American prisons often suffer from overcrowding and excessive imprisonment, resulting in high rates of infectious disease and violence and a lack of resources for rehabilitation programmes. This is compounded by the fact that American prisons often act as a recruitment center for gangs, which build and maintain criminal networks within the prison community. When released from prison, ex-convicts are often unable to fully integrate back into society, which exacerbates the problem of recidivism and creates disaffected communities which are often plagued by crime. It has been demonstrated that communities which host large numbers of gang members have higher rates of crime. Thus, mass incarceration, and the concomitant proliferation of criminal networks within prisons, is a catalyst for crime, rather than a preventative measure. \n\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in mitigating crime is a complex issue with no simple solution. Imprisonment can only be effective if it is able to address the root causes of the crime and focus on rehabilitation, but even this may not be enough to prevent the growth of criminal networks within prisons and the communities surrounding them. Ultimately, the prison system needs to work in conjunction with social services and community initiatives to address the social and economic factors which contribute to crime in the first place. While this may be a challenging task, it is the only way to create a criminal justice system which serves the best interests of society."

The result of these conditions is that many prisoners become dehumanized and more likely to engage in future criminal activities.\n\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime depends on the approach taken towards rehabilitation. Prisons that offer effective rehabilitation programs are more successful in reducing recidivism rates and allowing offenders to reintegrate into society. In contrast, the prison system that relies solely on incarceration without rehabilitation is not effective in addressing crime. Policymakers need to reassess the current state of the prison system and incorporate effective rehabilitation programs to address the problem of crime effectively.",

Moreover, the long term impact of imprisonment on mental health often goes undetected and untreated, thereby exacerbating the challenges of reintegrating offenders into society.\n\nTherefore, while prisons are still an essential component of the criminal justice system, there is an urgent need to transform them in line with a more nuanced understanding of crime and its causes in modern society. This could potentially involve a shift in resources from the construction of more prison facilities to investing in the creation of more robust and effective rehabilitation programs. This would enable the prison system to serve its role in not only punishing criminals but also in rehabilitating them.",

The adverse effects of prolonged incarceration without rehabilitation have been noticed in the high rates of interpersonal violence, gang formation, and riots in prisons. Such incidents significantly diminish the effectiveness of the prison system and affect the overall safety of the society.\n\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime depends largely on the approach taken by the penal system. Imprisonment can serve as a deterrent if it is complemented by robust rehabilitation programs. Providing inmates with the necessary skills and knowledge needed to integrate into society can significantly reduce recidivism rates. However, incarcerating individuals without any prospects of socializing or rehabilitation is counteractive to the objectives of the prison system.

Imprisonment has proven to be costly both to society and the individuals involved. The cost of incarceration is an additional burden on the limited state resources that could have been channeled into providing better rehabilitation programs for offenders. Additionally, it harms the families of those incarcerated. The family members can suffer financially and emotionally since they may lose their primary breadwinners or have to care for them upon their release.\n\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime varies. Imprisonment has been useful in deterring some offenses, such as violent crimes. However, for many types of crimes, particularly non-violent offenses, imprisonment should not be the solution. Instead, rehabilitation programs must be made readily available to offenders to provide them with the skills to integrate back into society and reduce recidivism rates.

It is important to note that punishment alone does not serve as a deterrent for criminal activities. Instead, offenders need to be given a chance to reform and become productive members of society.

The revolving door of recidivism and the lack of effective rehabilitation programs point towards a more comprehensive and multifaceted approach in addressing crime.

            "prompt": "DOES GLOBAL AID REALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "re, with recipients\" lives being improved in a tangible sense.\nYet, another major obstacle in foreign aid really impacting the lives of those in need are the very governments in charge of the aid-receiving countries. In many of these developing countries, corruption is rife and dishonest leaders would siphon the funds meant to help their countrymen for their own gain. A prime example of this is South Africa'spresident, Jacob Zuma, who spent a whopping US$16 million to do \"security updates\" to his house. In actuality, he had built a new swimming pool on his property and called it a \"fire protection device\", when the funds used for the project could have gone to help the South African community. Yet this preposterous situation is not a standalone case, as such cases are widely prevalent across the developing world. In Nepal, which suffers from poor governance and endemic corruption, the delivery of aid was delayed following the Gorkha Earthquake that hit the country in 2015. Isolated villages high up in the Himalayas were yet to be reached three weeks after the initial quake, increasing the potential for more deaths. Its reputation of corruption has also deterred aid, as donors are less willing to donate, ultimately impacting the innocent people affected by the quake. In this way, corrupt governments of aid-receiving countries inhibit the delivery of aid, using the resources for their own private benefit instead, which winds up hurting the people who actually need the aid.\nOn a societal level, excessive long-term aid can be damaging to the accountability systems of the country and cause a crutch mentality to develop. Whilst long-term aid in the aspects of education and healthcare can drastically improve the local systems, the reliance on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and external parties to deliver essential services to the community can reduce trust and power in the government. Moreover, since aid is fundamentally different from taxes, in that they do not come from people'sown pockets, they are less likely to demand accountability from the government, letting corruption slide and adopting a fatalistic attitude to the state of affairs of the country. The over-dependence on the private aid sector to deliver is exemplified in Nepal where the high incidence of corruption has led foreign aid funds to flow into NGOs and not the government, resulting in a brain drain in its civil service as civil servants leave the government sector to work for the better-funded private aid industry. This could pose a problem for the country in the long-term as the aid industry has to exit one day. On the difference between aid and taxes, behavioural economics indicates that people react differently to money that they perceive to be theirs, and money that they perceive to belong to others. A study by the University of Toronto and Chicago in which two groups of factory workers in China were given the same 80 yuan bonus, except that the first group was told that the bonus would be taken back if they failed to produce 10 units more of goods, while the second group was told they would be given the bonus afterwards if they produced 10 units more of goods. The results were surprising as one would expect given the same conditions, workers would work the same, yet the first group worked harder than the second. This effect is due to loss aversion, which would account for the nonchalant attitudes many people in the developing world have towards corruption cases since they do not pay taxes and the funds embezzled are coming from foreign aid. They simply do not care since the money is not theirs, and hence demand less accountability from the government. In the long-run, this could be detrimental for the governance of the country as leaders have more freedom, allowing them to act in selfish ways without the risk of being voted out of office by the public. It is thus evident that over-dependence on foreign aid can have long-term consequences on the economy and political state of countries.\nIn conclusion, while the aid industry is reshaping to be more results-driven to have real impacts on people who need it the most, it remains motivated by the selfish gains of the leaders giving and receiving the aid who each have their own agendas. Ultimately, the ones who do not stand to benefit and even suffer from these transactions are those who so desperately need the aid. While the current state of affairs for foreign aid may seem bleak, the shift in the aid ministry to compete for good results instead of mere good intentions may hopefully alleviate the situation, bringing us closer to solving the problems plaguing the needy.",

Additionally, there are concerns regarding the accountability and transparency of aid distribution, which can lead to corruption and misuse of funds. Moreover, aid can create a dependency, leading to a decline in self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Furthermore, some aid can be tied, meaning that countries that receive aid must purchase specific products or services from donor countries, leading to a decline in the local market.\n\nFurthermore, global aid can also have unintended consequences. One of the primary concerns is the impact on the local economy and industry. Importing goods and products from donor countries can lead to a decline in the local market, making it difficult for local businesses to compete. Additionally, some aid can be short-term and unsustainable, leading to a decline in development after the aid has ceased. Furthermore, aid can also lead to a cultural decline, as the imported products and lifestyles change the traditional values of the local population.\n\nIn conclusion, while global aid has its advantages and disadvantages, the efficacy of global aid in improving the lives of those who need it the most depends on various factors, including the proper distribution and allocation of aid, transparency and accountability, long-term sustainability and self-sufficiency, and consideration of unintended consequences. It is also important to recognize that global aid cannot solve all of the problems faced by society's most marginalized sections.

Additionally, this mindset shift has resulted in private companies, philanthropists, and foundations now being active in foreign aid. Bill and Melinda Gates themselves have a foundation, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, that has contributed billions of dollars in global aid. The results here are that these actors are not tied down by traditional bureaucratic problems government agencies might face, allowing for better-targeted aid. This has led to more innovation in foreign aid. For example, D-Rev, a non-profit that creates medical technologies to be more accessible to people in need, has developed life-changing products such as a $80 prosthetic knee that can provide vital mobility support. The focus is now more on people, rather than political gain. It seems that the people of these countries are finally becoming the focus of aid, and they stand a better chance of actually benefiting from it.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign aid is not simply about giving with no strings attached. More often than not, it is used for political reasons, to advance certain agendas or to create policy changes. Governments are not the only donors in this game of global aid, as philanthropists and private organizations have also entered the space with a focus on results-driven aid.

Aid can lead to dependency on the aid-giving countries, and the aid-receiving country can become complacent, relying solely on handouts instead of their resources. Additionally, the influx of aid can distort local economies, making it difficult for local businesses to thrive and sell their products as the aid becomes free and readily available, with no need for the recipients to work for it. This can lead to the collapse of industries and economies in the affected countries. In Ethiopia, for instance, local farmers were priced out of the market for agricultural products after Ghanaian farmers flooded the market with produce resulting from foreign aid. In another instance, when Haiti received an influx of free rice from America, local Haitian rice farmers were driven out of business, and the country became dependent on foreign rice.\nIn conclusion, whether a developing country benefits from aid or not depends on several factors. Conditionalitiesattached to the aid by the donors provide incentives that primarily benefit them, while unconditional aid can lead to a recipient\u2019s dependency on aid. However, the new development of a results-driven aid industry provides an opening for potential progress and improvement for aid recipients.

Moreover, the aid may not necessarily change the root of the problem that led to their need for aid in the first place, for instance, corruption or poor governance. Many aid-recipient countries have dubious records of management, as they might disburse the aid among themselves or lack the skill to run efficiently the aid-provided programs. Thus leading to the aid not being used effectively and not making any substantive change in the recipients\u2019 lives. Additionally, while the reliance on aid continues to increase, the growth of smaller and developing countries remain slow, emphasizing how the current aid-giving system is not sustainable and is not leading to the growth of the underdeveloped nations.\nIn conclusion, while foreign aid may seem like a noble act of generosity, its effectiveness depends solely on the intentions guidin the aid-providers. With its conditionalities and self-serving motives, aid can be harmful and even more destructive to those it is meant to help.

There is also a risk of dependency on aid, which can hinder a country's development in the long run. Additionally, there have been cases of corruption and mismanagement of aid funds, which defeats the purpose of providing aid in the first place.\n\nMoreover, it can be argued that global aid is just a temporary solution to the problems faced by developing countries. To truly improve the lives of those who need it the most, long-term solutions need to be implemented. This includes promoting sustainable development, investing in education and healthcare, and empowering marginalized populations. Additionally, developed countries need to address issues such as unfair trade policies and debt relief, which can have a significant impact on the economies of developing countries.\n\nIn conclusion, global aid can have both positive and negative effects on the lives of those who need it the most. While aid can provide temporary relief during emergencies and help in building infrastructure, there are also concerns about its distribution, dependency, and effectiveness in the long run. It is important for developed countries to address the root causes of poverty and inequality and work towards promoting sustainable development.",

There have been instances where aid has been misused and has not provided the intended benefits to those who need it. Furthermore, aid can sometimes create a dependency on external assistance and may not promote self-sufficiency and sustainable development.\n\nAnother challenge with global aid is ensuring that it addresses the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment. Providing aid without addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate poverty may not lead to long-term solutions. Hence, it is essential to have a holistic approach to aid that involves addressing factors such as political stability, good governance, and access to education and healthcare. This approach can help in creating a conducive environment for development and help in breaking the cycle of poverty.\n\nIn conclusion, global aid plays a vital role in improving the lives of those who need it the most. However, it is crucial to have a nuanced understanding of what aid entails and its potential benefits and limitations. A well-coordinated approach to aid that involves addressing root causes, promoting self-sufficiency, and ensuring transparency and accountability can be an effective means of promoting equitable and sustainable development.

Moreover, aid can create a culture of dependency, where the recipient country becomes reliant on global aid and fails to develop solutions to their problems.\n\nFurthermore, critics argue that global aid can also have negative effects on the recipient country's economy. Aid can lead to the devaluation of local currencies, which can affect the local industries and make them uncompetitive. Additionally, aid can lead to the displacement of local businesses, which can have long-term consequences for the economy.\n\nIn conclusion, global aid is a complex issue with both advantages and disadvantages. While aid can be beneficial in many ways, it is necessary to scrutinize the motives behind providing the aid, the distribution mechanisms, and the long-term effects of the aid.

This leads to the perpetuation of the cycle of poverty and dependence. In addition, global aid can create a sense of dependency among the recipients, which can lead to a lack of initiative and self-reliance. Furthermore, there is a risk that the provision of aid may become a political tool, with donor countries using it to further their interests, rather than the needs of the recipient countries.\n\nTherefore, it is important to ensure that global aid is provided in a transparent and accountable manner. There needs to be a robust monitoring system in place to ensure that the aid reaches the intended beneficiaries and is used for the intended purpose. In addition, the provision of aid needs to be accompanied by measures to promote self-reliance and independence among the recipients. This can be done by supporting local businesses, providing education and training, and encouraging entrepreneurship.\n\nIn conclusion, global aid has the potential to improve the lives of those who need it the most, but it is not a panacea for all problems facing developing countries. The distribution and allocation of aid need to be carefully monitored, and efforts should be made to promote self-reliance and independence among the recipients.

            "prompt": "\"INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY IS ALWAYS A DESIRABLE GOAL.\" DO YOU AGREE?",
            "human_gen_truncate": " gives us the time to chase after the things that truly matter in life, be it fulfilment from pursuing one'spassions or quality time with loved ones. This is grounded on the premise that the meaning of life is derived from diverse experiences and memories. With a longer runway, those who live longer have more opportunities to indulge in these experiences. Additionally, a longer lifetime enables people to contribute to society more. Take the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who died at the tender age of 35. His greatest works include \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" and \"Rondo Alla Turca\" which are widely enjoyed and studied by many even till today, more than 200 years after they were first composed. Had he lived a longer life, he would have undoubtedly been able to contribute many more great classical pieces to mankind. It is clear that longer life expectancy gives us the chance to experience a happier and more meaningful life all while contributing more to society.\nThat said, a longer life does not necessarily equate to a more meaningful life, as many people spend their twilight years battling debilitating diseases, live in loneliness or even having to work till the very last second just to feed themselves. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study found that while global life expectancy is 73 years, that of healthy life expectancy is only 63, meaning that on average, people spend 10 years living in less than ideal health. This concept of years living in less than ideal health is succinctly captured in \"Years Lived with Disability (YLDs)\". In other words, while one may technically live a longer life, it may not be any better as the years spent living with a disease, living on medication on a daily basis, shuttling between home and the hospital or even hospitalized for long periods are much worse. Loneliness is also another factor that could significantly reduce the quality of life for the aged, as they may not have friends or family to rely on. As discussed earlier, \"kodokushi\" in Japan is a phenomenon that was borne out of the rising life expectancy coupled with several other factors. Many of the victims of \"kodokushi\" are corporate workers who did not have many friends or family outside of work. Retirement, instead of giving them time to live a more fulfilling life, plunged them into isolation as they were removed from the corporate world. The loneliness and despair could have played a role leading up to their eventual deaths, with no one caring enough to visit them in life or death. The elderly poor are also subject to a lower quality of life as they have to work tirelessly, often in menial jobs just to make ends meet. This is particularly prevalent in South Korea, where elderly poor will \"work until they die\". They say, \"I\"ll take care of myself as long as I can \u2026 then I\"ll go to the hospital and die.\" Some scour the streets to pick up recyclables and waste paper, lugging some 100 kilograms of waste for a whole day to the junk depot in exchange for less than 10,000 KRW. Others work in less savoury jobs as elderly prostitutes known as \"Bacchus ladies\", soliciting in parks and plazas for a measly pay as well. South Korea sure sits near the top of life expectancy rankings at 82.7 years, but the bitter fates that more than half of the elderly population endures raises the question if it is a fate worse than death. Thus, it is painfully obvious that long bitter lives spent in ill health, isolation and hardship may be even worse than death.\nTaking a more philosophical approach, living forever would be meaningless in the long run. Death, paradoxically, gives life the meaning which we all seek. The literal deadline gives urgency to everything we do in life, forcing us to work with a sense of purpose, perhaps to leave behind a legacy, something that is again only possible in death. The hypothetical proposition of eternal life would bore us to death and cause Man to lapse into laziness, cynicism and self-servitude. On the contrary, the fact that we will only exist on this Earth for a mere couple of decades motivates us to live with more drive and zeal, rather than whiling our time away. Acts of nobility, self-sacrifice and creativity are borne out of the knowledge that our time here is finite. In this way, increasing life expectancy taken to the extreme is undesirable and life would be forfeited of any meaning.\nIn essence, while increased life expectancy may indicate healthy economic growth and good public welfare systems for the nation, it also puts pressure on those very systems, creating a plethora of problems for the national economy. On a personal level, though it affords us the chance to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life, it is also capable of making life more miserable than death. Moreover, philosophically, an endless life would be meaningless. Perhaps, if we lived shorter lives more saturated in meaning instead, fewer of us will end up dying alone and decomposing in our own filth.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " healthcare and medical advancements ensures that everyone can benefit from these improvements. Longer life expectancy levels the playing field for certain groups of people who previously could expect to live a shorter life than others based on socioeconomic status. In this way, increasing life expectancy promotes social equality and eliminates health disparities.\n\nFinally, longer life expectancy means that people have more time to enjoy their retirement and experience all that life has to offer. Individuals can spend more time with family and friends, travel, volunteer, and pursue their passions. Organizations such as AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) enrich the lives of the elderly by providing opportunities for social interaction, healthcare, and financial advice. Longer lives give seniors more time to give back to society through volunteering or mentorship, which promotes social harmony and community.\n\nDespite the benefits of increased life expectancy, some argue that there are downsides to people living longer. The most prominent argument is the increasing need for social welfare programs. As people live longer, the elderly comprise a more significant proportion of society, and they require more resources to ensure they are healthy and living a decent life. This requires an increase in funding for social welfare programs, such as public health care, public pensions, and affordable housing.\n\nIn conclusion, the goal of increasing life expectancy is desirable. Longer life expectancy translates into a higher quality of life, economic growth, social equality, and community engagement. We should continue to strive for a lengthier, healthier life for everyone, to ensure that individuals have the best chance to live life to the fullest. Additional investment in healthcare, medical research, and welfare programs will promote longer life expectancy while ensuring that the elderly live a dignified life. By pursuing this goal, we can improve our society\u2019s overall wellbeing and promote social harmony.",

                "may provide more opportunities to embark on meaningful pursuits. However, this view is contingent on the assumption that the additional years will be healthy, which is not always the case. With a longer lifespan, the risk of being afflicted with chronic illnesses such as Alzheimer's, cancer or heart disease will inevitably increase especially in an ageing population. This means that the elderly may have to manage a lower quality of life, and more family members may be burdened with the responsibility of caregiving. For instance, some elderly may require regular assistance with daily tasks like bathing or eating which would pose an emotional and financial cost on their loved ones. Moreover, with tradition slowly fading away, the elderly may feel increasingly disconnected or irrelevant, with their knowledge and life experiences becoming increasingly distant and irrelevant. In this sense, a shorter but more meaningful life seems like a viable alternative, as it allows one to leave behind a more pronounced impact or legacy, instead of living a long and drawn-out life that ends in loneliness or discomfort.\nAside from personal and economic costs, an endless lifespan may also lead to mundane and meaningless life. Foundations of philosophy such as existentialism touch upon the idea that life has no inherent purpose or meaning to it. Rather, the meaning of life is defined by individuals themselves through the actions they take. Inherent in this view is the concept of mortality- awareness that at some point life will end. This concept fuels actions, allowing individuals to make the most of their time on Earth and find what they want to achieve in life. If people knew that they had an endless lifespan, it may lead to a sense of lethargy and lack of drive because no matter what they do, they will always have more time. This may make people apathetic to taking risks in life and finding what makes them happy because they know they have all the time in the world to explore. In this sense, shorter lives may motivate people to find a greater meaning in their actions, as they feel the need to make the most of their time before they pass on.\nIn conclusion, while higher life expectancy may be desirable from an economic perspective, it brings with it increased personal and financial costs. Moreover, a short but meaningful life may be more fulfilling in terms of allowing people to leave behind a greater legacy and motivating them to find greater meaning in their actions. The emphasis should, therefore, be on finding a balance between extending life while simultaneously maintaining a high quality of life.",
                "may present opportunities to indulge in the pleasures that were previously unattainable. For instance, retirees may have more time to travel or engage in volunteer work. They may also have more time to bond with their loved ones or to participate in their favourite hobbies. This would allow for a sense of fulfilment and happiness that may not have been possible without a longer life. However, the downside to a longer life is that it may reduce the urgency to live life to the fullest. Knowing that one has decades of life ahead of them may lead to procrastination and complacency, resulting in an unfulfilled life that is bereft of meaning. It is arguable that by setting a deadline to life, we may be spurred on to accomplish more meaningful pursuits and to cherish the time we have left. Additionally, a longer life may increase the risk of \"kodokushi'', as mentioned in the beginning of this essay.\nIn conclusion, while longer life expectancy is often seen as desirable in terms of the benefits that come with it, there are also costs that must be considered. This is especially evident in the strain placed on society's healthcare infrastructure and national finances. Philosophically, the endless nature of life may also lead to a sense of meaningless existence. Ultimately, it is a personal decision to decide whether a longer life is worth pursuing, based on one's own values and beliefs.",

However, with longer life comes increased potential for medical conditions, physical and cognitive impairments. This may ultimately limit one's ability to enjoy life, making it less meaningful. A shorter but meaningful life may be preferable, as it allows one to cherish moments and live without lingering on pain and limitations. In addition, the costs of healthcare can sometimes outweigh the benefits of prolonging one's life, leading to financial burden and sometimes leading to \"kodokushi\" situations where elderly people die alone and undiscovered due to not wanting to be a financial burden on their families. It is important for individuals to consider what truly makes their life meaningful and for society as a whole to consider the costs and benefits of prolonged life expectancy. In conclusion, while higher life expectancy is often viewed as a measure of societal welfare, it comes with both societal and personal costs that must be taken into account.",
                "could provide the additional time needed to realise one's dreams and ambitions. By increasing the time spent with loved ones, there could be more opportunities to deepen familial ties. This could potentially bring about more emotional security and support for the elderly, who may feel isolated in a society that values youth and productivity. Nonetheless, this line of thought is also double-edged as a longer life could also translate to a longer time spent enduring pain and suffering. There has also been a rising number of elderly who suffer from depression, anxiety and loneliness. This may be coupled with the fact that with age comes increased probability of the onset of diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. In the case of \"lonely deaths\" Kodokushi, it is evident that not all individuals are fortunate enough to enjoy the benefits and support of a close-knit family, leading them towards a lonely existence, and ultimately to a lonely death. Thus, whether a longer life is truly beneficial for the individual may be up for debate.\nFrom a philosophical standpoint, the gospel of eternal youth may lead to a meaningless existence. Life gains real value from being finite, as limitations force one to be prudent and value time to achieve what they want in life. Without an end, life's significance diminishes, as there is no longer any urgency to achieve a certain goal or pursue a certain passion. If one is guaranteed an endless life, there will be no need to appreciate time, as the mindset will be \"there's always tomorrow\". One can argue that life will be significantly more fulfilling with the knowledge that an end to life is near, as there is a deadline to work towards and much gains from knowing that time is scarce.\nIn conclusion, there are many aspects to consider before formulating a single conclusion on whether the goal of extending life expectancy is a good one. Economically, one can argue that having a longer lifespan signifies a better standard of living and improved social welfare. However, this comes at the cost of thousands of dollars for the government and individuals, who would have to grapple with the increased strain of healthcare and support for the elderly. From a personal level, longer life could bring about greater opportunities to pursue one's passions and strengthen familial ties. Nonetheless, this could be double-edged as the increased vulnerability to disease, depression and loneliness could lead to further suffering. Finally, from a philosophical standpoint, it could be argued that with an endless existence, life could potentially be rendered meaningless. Thus, while extending life expectancy may seem like the optimal solution, it is essential that we examine the potential impacts on a myriad of levels to determine if indeed, longer life is a better life.",
                "may seem like a luxury. However, it is undeniable that a long life can also come with its own set of problems such as loneliness and economic difficulties. As mentioned earlier, the concept of \"kodokushi\" or lonely death is a real issue, especially in nations with a rapidly ageing population. Japan is one of the most severe cases with an increased number of elderly people choosing to live alone, resulting in 30,000 people dying alone every year. This is a staggering number, and it sheds light on the darker side of a longer life expectancy. It is also no secret that an extended life can lead to economic troubles, with retirement savings drying up and limited job opportunities for senior citizens. In some countries, especially those with inadequate social welfare policies, many elderly struggle to meet basic daily needs and find it hard to afford healthcare, which is essential for a long life. It is important to balance the benefits of a longer life with the potential downsides and take proactive measures to provide support to those that may find themselves struggling later in life.\nFrom a philosophical perspective, an endless life can also cause one to question the very meaning of life as the scarcity of time is what gives it value. It begs the question of whether a life without an endpoint is worth living as the motivation to achieve and experience fades when there is no final destination. Additionally, many believe that death gives life itself meaning as it forces one to cherish and make the most out of every moment. Without the inevitability of death, would people be as motivated to live their best lives and create lasting memories or relationships? This subjective view on the meaning of life could also potentially diminish the necessity of extending one's life expectancy as it puts more emphasis on the quality of life.\nOverall, while a higher life expectancy may seem like the ultimate goal for a prosperous society, it is essential to consider both the benefits and costs that come with it. The strain on healthcare systems, the economic burden on governments and individuals, and the potential downsides of a longer life must all be factored in when deciding whether increasing life expectancy is truly a desirable outcome. At the end of the day, while having more years may be nice, quality over quantity should be the ultimate goal for a fulfilling life.",

After all, what is the point of living until 80 or 90 years of age if we have not had the opportunity to truly live, and only spent our time slaving over work and matters that do not truly matter to us? A longer life may also allow us to make a larger impact on the world by being given more time to contribute to society, to our families and to those around us. It may also give us more time to reflect on our past and attain closure, readying ourselves for the next chapter in life.\nHowever, an endless life may also prove to be detrimental, both emotionally and philosophically. It may render life meaningless,as the notion of finite existence provides us with the drive to live life to the fullest and make the most of it. A finite life gives us the urgency to explore, learn and experience life, making the most of our precious time. Without the end looming over our heads, we may not have the same eagerness to grab life by the horns and may take it for granted. A longer life may also bring about more emotional turmoil as we watch loved ones pass on, with us being left behind to watch more and more leave this world as well. This constant sense of loss may cause us more distress and despair as we grow older. Furthermore, a longer life may also cause us to be stuck in our ways, as there is more time to rut ourselves into routine and may limit our ability to adapt to change.\nIn conclusion, while increasing life expectancy may seem like a desirable goal, it is not without its costs. Longer lives may strain the government's finances and healthcare infrastructure, while also potentially leading to more emotional turmoil and a sense of purposelessness. It is important to consider the quality of life alongside the quantity of life, and to cherish the time we do have. After all, life is finite, and it is up to us to make it a meaningful one.",
                "may allow us to experience more of what life has to offer without feeling rushed. This may lead to a greater sense of fulfilment and happiness. However, longer life expectancy may also mean more years of living with chronic illnesses, loneliness due to empty nests or the loss of loved ones, and physical or mental decline. If one's senior years are plagued with health problems and depression, it may become difficult to even achieve a basic quality of life. Additionally, since a higher life expectancy is only attained after years of medical advances, there may be additional medical conditions still not possible to cure. Thus, this begs the question of whether a longer life necessarily leads to an increased sense of joy or meaning.\nFrom a philosophical perspective, an endless life may render life meaningless, as humans can only enjoy so many experiences. If we could live forever, we may lose sight of the value of the present moment and put off the things that matter to us until it is too late. Knowing that our time on earth is finite may give us a greater sense of purpose and urgency to live our lives to the fullest. American author, Joseph Campbell, famously said, \"The goal of life is to make your heartbeat match the beat of the universe, to match your nature with Nature.\" Death is integral to life, and it signifies new beginnings and change. It may be argued that without an end in sight, life may become stagnant and lose its natural rhythm.\nIn conclusion, while higher life expectancy is a sign of societal progress, it comes with its own set of challenges. Longer life expectancy may strain healthcare and financial resources, making it less desirable. It may also lead to a greater sense of fulfilment at a personal level, but it may also bring about more years of ill health and decline. From a philosophical perspective, a finite life may be more meaningful than an endless one. Ultimately, instead of solely focusing on increasing life expectancy, we should aim to create opportunities for individuals to lead meaningful and purposeful lives, while also being aware of the value of the present moment.",

This is especially true for those who maintain good health and remain independent in their old age. They may be able to enjoy life to the fullest with a clear mind and a healthy body.\nHowever, there is also the possibility that a longer life may actually render life meaningless, as mentioned previously. With endless amounts of time, people may begin to feel that life lacks purpose and direction. They may experience boredom and apathy as they trudge through an endless stream of days. This is especially difficult when they are no longer able to engage in activities that they used to enjoy, such as playing sports or working due to old age or health problems. A longer life may lead to a sense of disillusionment and lack of fulfillment, highlighting how it may not be the best goal to pursue indefinitely.\nIn conclusion, while life expectancy is an important factor when it comes to societal welfare, there are also costs to a longer life, both on an economic and personal level. The tides may be changing as people start to question if a shorter but more meaningful life is better. A balance must be struck between providing quality healthcare for the aged while ensuring that it does not become a financial burden on future generations.

Furthermore, as medical advancements continue to progress, it is possible for an elderly person to enjoy life without being hindered by age-related illnesses to a certain extent. The key phrase here is \"to a certain extent\", as statistics have shown that people over the age of 75 experience greater difficulty with activities such as walking and dressing themselves as compared to those below the age of 75. There is also the possibility of cognitive decline as one ages, which may hamper their quality of life. Therefore, while a longer life does provide the opportunity to enjoy life to the fullest, it is not without challenges that must be addressed.\n\nLastly, from a philosophical perspective, an endless life may render life meaningless. A majority of people see life as having a beginning, middle and end, which gives it structure and defines it. If one's life extends indefinitely, then there is no definitive end to it, resulting in life becoming meaningless. Morbidly, one could argue that the concept of 'kodokushi' only reinforces this notion. It is not only an ending to someone's life, but it is also an ending that is lonely and grim. Furthermore, as the population ages, the question arises over whether the elderly will be able to pass on their knowledge, values and traditions to future generations. If a significant portion of the population passes on alone, with no one to speak to or no one to leave a legacy to, then the continuity of intangible heritage may be broken, leading to a disconnected society. Thus, a short but meaningful life may be more desirable than a long life that lacks purpose.\n\nIn conclusion, while higher life expectancy may be an indicator of improving societal welfare, it also brings about financial strain on the government's public health systems. Personally, a longer life allows one to savour life's moments and pursue passions, but it is not without challenges that must be addressed. Philosophically, the concept of 'kodokushi' raises the question of whether life would be meaningless if it were endless, and whether a short but meaningful life is more desirable.",

Furthermore, a longer life also means more time for personal growth and learning, in the pursuit of achieving self-actualization. However, the pursuit of personal fulfillment through a long life may not be so straightforward. The concept of diminishing returns comes into play when one spends more time on something, with each additional unit of time yielding less marginal utility than the previous. With longer lifespans, individuals may also face declining physical and mental health, leading to a lower quality of life as they age. It may also lead to isolation and loneliness as they outlive their peers and loved ones, resulting in \u201ckodokushi\u201d. Therefore, it is important to consider how individuals can make the most of their longer life spans, by balancing personal fulfillment with societal and economic considerations.\nIn conclusion, the goal of increasing life expectancy may seem beneficial to society and individuals, but it comes with its own set of challenges and implications. Longer lifespans will inevitably place a heavier burden on the government'shealthcare infrastructure, leading to a strain on national finances and the workforce. Additionally, the pursuit of personal fulfillment through a long life may face diminishing marginal returns and potentially lead to isolation and loneliness.

Clearly, juggling work and raising children at the same time is a feat in itself, making good parenting harder in the modern world.\nAnother reason that parenting may be harder today than ever is the existence of the omnipresent mass media which directly promotes ideas that parents may not approve of. As discussed in the previous paragraph, due to parents being mentally absent, parents usually toss some form of a mobile device, usually a mobile phone or tablet to young children to pacify them. In an instant, children'swails and cries are silenced by the brightly coloured screens that captivate their attention. While parents might love this quick fix solution, it could prove to have long-lasting repercussions unbeknownst to them. When parents set children'sentertainment like \"Finger Family Song\" or \"Surprise Egg\" reveals to play on YouTube, they usually do not realise the autoplay function on the platform which allows related videos to stream continuously. The creators of these videos have realised this function though and some of them have exploited this function by algorithmically creating mashups of familiar cartoon characters in violent situations. James Bridle, an artist and writer dealing primarily with technology, knowledge and the end of the future, examined this issue in his TED Talk entitled \"The nightmare of childrens\" YouTube\". He notes that these videos \"exploit and terrify young minds\". In our world today, where parents toss their children down the spiral of mutated, terrifying cartoons, it is hard to argue that parents today are good parents at all. For older kids, themes of sex, violence and substance abuse are promoted repetitively in the mass media as risk-free, harmless and even cool. These ideas typically do not align with what most parents would advocate in their families, yet children are constantly exposed to such material, perhaps due to parents\" negligence in monitoring what their children watch. Evidently, good parenting today is more difficult due to the dangers that threaten children'ssafety lurking everywhere online.\nDespite all that have been discussed, the most crucial question has yet to be addressed: What is good parenting? As times change, expectations of parents have evolved in tandem. Parents in the past could get away with a laidback child-rearing approach in line with the slower pace of living of the time, yet that same parenting style applied today would never fly. Parents today are expected to be more involved in their children'slives, especially in their academics. This rings true for many young Singaporean children who have had to grow up under \"tiger mums\" and \"helicopter parents\". Parents today take on multiple hats for their children, including chauffeuring their children from enrichment class after enrichment class and being a personal tutor who monitors children do homework. It is clear that the very definition of a good parent has radically changed. While it is easy to pin the blame on overly competitive parents for piling enrichment classes, assessment books and stress on their young children, we must first examine the situation from the parents\" perspectives. Parents face more stress than ever to birth valedictorians, scholars or just successful (by society'sdefinition) children. This can be attributed to the abundance of parenting resources, discussed earlier, that tell parents they have to do this or do that or else they are not providing the very best for their children and that they are \"bad parents\". This causes parents to act in adverse ways, transferring the pressure on them to be \"good parents\" unto their children to be \"successful\". Therefore, with the bar to be a \"good parent\" set so ridiculously high, who can safely claim to be a \"good parent\"?\nTo conclude, good parenting is hard to define but the standard to be considered a good parent has undoubtedly been raised over the past few decades. Parents now also have to wrestle with the mass media that threatens to corrupt their children'sminds, while juggling longer work hours at the same time. It certainly is a feat to raise children today but other parties like the government and the Internet have offered some consolation in the arduous road of parenthood. The Internet'sready abundance of parenting resources and forums would definitely prove useful to parents at every stage, while the government'sliberal financial help to defray the cost of raising children certainly help alleviate the factor of cost, associated with raising children here in the most expensive city in the world. Despite these, it must be admitted that good parenting in Singapore is indeed more challenging today than ever before.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "luencers represent a new generation of role-models and idols for children. Often, what is displayed online ranges from unrealistic standards of beauty to social behavior standards that don't align with typical family values. The peer pressure can create a barrier between parents and their children that\u2019s almost impossible to break, leading to a gap in understanding between the two.\n\nAnother challenge which nowadays is heavily influenced by societal changes is the development of children's mental health. We previously did not regard children's mental health as a significant concern, but today, things have changed. Children's anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts have risen because of multiple factors, like the lack of communication, pressure from academic success and the general stresses of modern life. A child\u2019s fundamental harmony is crucial to their academic, social, and personal accomplishments, and therefore, parents should be active in addressing issues of mental health.\n\nFinally, as a society, we have become increasingly competitive, and parents are often judged based on the achievements of their children. This can lead to undue pressure on both parents and children to attain perfect grades, attend elite schools and extracurricular activities. While forcing children to achieve is not new, the competitiveness of our society today creates unrealistic expectations, which is unhealthy for everyone involved.\n\nIn conclusion, it is essential to acknowledge that good parenting is becoming more challenging in our society today. As our society evolves, it's crucial that parents adapt to these new challenges. Parents need to provide a stable foundation for their children by creating an ideal environment that encourages trust, communication, and emotional stability, without excessive pressure or unrealistic expectations.

This means that even when parents are supposed to be spending quality time with their children, they are constantly distracted and divided between work and family responsibilities.\n\nIn addition to the issue of long working hours, modern technology has also complicated the job of parenting. With the advent of the Internet, social media, and smartphones, children are exposed to a vast range of content, both good and bad, ranging from violence and pornographic material to online predators. Parents today have to deal with this new dimension of parenting and try to keep up with their children's online activities, which can be a difficult task. Cyberbullying has also emerged as a new phenomenon, and parents have to find ways to safeguard their children's mental health and emotional wellbeing in the online world.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are many resources and benefits available to parents today, we cannot ignore the fact that parenting has become more challenging due to the changes in society. Working long hours, balancing work and family responsibilities, and keeping up with new technologies and their impact on children's wellbeing are all issues that modern parents have to grapple with. As a society, we need to continue to find ways to support parents in their roles and ensure that our children receive the best possible care and upbringing.",

In addition to work, there is also the omnipresent influence of the media, which has become intertwined with our lives.

Children's exposure to the media can have negative effects on their social and cognitive development, which can make parenting a challenge. And while resources for parenting are plentiful on the Internet, there are also many contradictory and confusing pieces of advice out there, which can add to the anxiety parents already experience. It is clear that parenting in Singapore today is not without its challenges.\nIn conclusion, while parenting today has become more manageable in terms of financial support and the availability of resources on the Internet, the challenges of modern-day life have made parenting more difficult than ever before. Finding a balance between work and family life is a challenge that many parents face, and the omnipresence of mass media adds to their burden.

All these distractions take time away from children and as Dr Theseira pointed out, \u201cChildren learn through play, which requires presence and attention from parents.\u201d The time and attention parents dedicate to their children is crucial to their development and success in life. This makes parenting more challenging today than in the past when work was more clearly delineated from private life.\nAnother challenge parents face today is the omnipresent mass media. Children today are exposed to a wide range of media at a much younger age than before and this can lead to an overexposure to inappropriate content. Social media platforms such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram are widely popular with teenagers and they can be a breeding ground for cyberbullying. In addition, social media creates an impostor syndrome where teens feel they have to project a certain image to be liked by their peers, creating an unhealthy pressure for them. Parents have to navigate these challenges by setting limits on their children'smedia usage and teaching them to be responsible digital citizens. This is a challenge that previous generations of parents did not have to face and it requires parental involvement on a level that might not have been necessary before.\nIn conclusion, good parenting remains as important as ever in creating a stable and fruitful society. While there have been improvements in terms of financial assistance and an abundance of parenting resources, the challenges of longer working hours and distractions from the mass media mean that parenting in modern-day Singapore remains more demanding than in the past. Good parenting is not just about providing for a child'sphysical needs, but also their emotional and mental well-being.

Additionally, the omnipresence of media today poses another challenge to good parenting. Children are exposed to different forms of media from a very young age and parents need to be aware of the content their children are exposed to and also manage their child'smedia intake. This would involve monitoring their child'sInternet activity and TV shows watched to ensure that they are safe and appropriate. This is an added responsibility that parents today have to shoulder and is another factor that contributes to the complexity of modern parenting.\n\nIn conclusion, while parenting may be easier in terms of financial assistance and access to resources compared to the past, parenting in Singapore today is still more challenging than ever before due to the demands of a fast-paced work life and the omnipresent media. Parents need to juggle work, childcare, and monitoring their child'smedia intake. The pressure of modern parenting can take a toll on parents, but it is important for them to be attuned to their child'sneeds and focus on building a strong emotional connection with their children. Ultimately, a good parent is one who is able to provide for their children'sphysical needs while also nurturing the child'semotional well-being; this is not an easy task but the rewards of being a good parent are immeasurable.",
                "n during non-work hours. Thus, working hours do not end at the office, leaving less time for family bonding and healthy parent-child relationships. Coupled with the omnipresence of the mass media, which bombards young children with messages that parents might not necessarily want their children to absorb, parenting in Singapore is increasingly challenging. While the Internet is a source of valuable information, it is also a source of information overload--conflicting parenting advice and opinions are a mere click away. Parents then find themselves confused and unsure about what to do, and this makes the act of parenting all the more challenging.\nIn conclusion, parenting in Singapore today is a mixed bag. Parents have access to more parenting resources than ever before, making it easier to gain knowledge and support. Additionally, financial aid from the government gives parents a head start in meeting the physical needs of their children. However, long working hours and the inundation of media messages make the act of parenting increasingly challenging. Quality time spent together as a family has become scarcer. While parenting today is not an insurmountable challenge, parents may find themselves struggling to balance work, media literacy, and parenting.

This makes a parent'sjob much harder as the demands of work impede the amount of time that can be spent with their children. It also leads to parents feeling stressed and drained, which can have a negative impact on their ability to parent effectively. This creates a vicious cycle where parents feel they are not parenting well enough, which in turn leads to even more stress and reduced ability to parent effectively.\nThe other challenge of parenting in today's society is the pervasive influence of mass media. Children today are bombarded by all sorts of media such as television, social media and YouTube, which can have adverse effects on their well-being. Violence, sex, drugs are common in media content and even young children can develop negative behaviours based on what they observe in the media. The media also creates an unattainable standard of beauty or behaviour that children feel they have to live up to. The media's influence extends beyond traditional media as well, as children grow up more and more connected to the internet, which is a realm that is even less controllable by parents. For example, it is impossible to filter everything that a child might see on YouTube or in video games. As a result, parents today face greater challenges than ever before in shielding their children from objectionable content and managing the influence of the media on their impressionable minds.\nIn conclusion, I agree that good parenting today is harder than in the past. While parents today may have some advantages such as government financial assistance and the abundance of parenting resources on the internet, the demands of work and the pervasive influence of the media present major obstacles to parenting. As society evolves, parents have to constantly adapt to these challenges and find new ways of tackling them if they hope to raise well-adjusted, happy children.

This means that parents today may have less emotional energy to devote to their children, potentially having a negative effect on their parenting skills. In contrast, parents in the past had less to worry about when it came to giving their children emotional support because the work-life balance was less skewed, hence they had more time for their families. This lack of balance has dealt a heavy blow to parenting today and is indeed making good parenting more difficult.\nLastly, another factor contributing to the difficulty of parenting today could be the omnipresence of mass media. Technology and the Internet have brought with it a barrage of information for everyone, and children are not exempt from this. Social media, for one, has been widely dubbed to be one of the biggest culprits that disrupts the parent-child relationship. The competition for attention between parents and children in Singaporean families led by busier parents and overstimulated children is steeper than ever before, and all these can be brought to the doorstep of the mass media that infiltrates our everyday lives. While some parents try their best to filter content, the digital age has brought about accessibility to everything. This has made it harder to protect young children and keep them away from less desirable content. This, in turn, has made good parenting in the current digital age more difficult.\nIn conclusion, good parenting in modern Singapore is more challenging today than before. Although parents do benefit from government schemes that financially assist them with raising their children, the issue of separation between work and private life, the rise of the Internet age and the omnipresence of mass media have all negatively impacted the parent-child relationship. While it is still possible for parents to be good parents through conscious effort, it is evident that our current landscape impairs good parenting.",

In addition to this, the rise of mass media, especially social media platforms like Facebook, twitter and Instagram, can be a contributing factor to why parenting is harder in Singapore. The ability of social media to distract from quality family time has become more ingrained in daily life. Parents may use their mobile devices to catch up on work emails, but they may also be using them to scroll through social media feeds, which can take away precious time that could be spent with their children. In this way, the rise of mass media and the borderless world of work has contributed to the difficulties faced by parents in Singapore. \n\nIn conclusion, it can be said that good parenting is more challenging in Singapore today. While there certainly are improvements in terms of financial assistance for new parents, and a wealth of information and resources for parenting which were not available in the past, the blurring of work-life balance and the rise of mass media have created new challenges for parents.

While it is true that parents today have access to more government support and parenting resources compared to the past, the challenges that parents face today, including longer working hours and the encroachment of work into private life, make it more challenging to be a good parent than in the past.

While the Internet can be a resource for parenting, it can also be an enemy, inundating parents with unfiltered information and causing them to question their parenting decisions. Moreover, the variety of digital devices and form of entertainment now means that children\u2019s exposure to online threats is higher than ever before which leaves parents to worrying about their child, monitoring what they do online and what they watch on TV. This new digital age thus brings up new problems and challenges for parents, making it even harder for parents to navigate this space.\nIn conclusion, while it\u2019s reasonable to say it\u2019s both easier and harder to be a parent today, there\u2019s no doubt that there are new and unique challenges present in modern society that make it more difficult for parents to be effective. Despite the financial assistance and the abundance of parenting resources, it can be argued that long working hours and mass media can affright parents today, making it more harder than ever before. Regardless, the answer to good parenting is elusive and is bound to be an ongoing debate and that as a society, we must continue to evolve our perspective on what it means to be a good parent to better support parents in the modern world."

Parents now need to navigate this maze of expectations and temptations that influence their children, which can be challenging.\n\nMoreover, the global COVID-19 pandemic has brought about additional complexities in parenting. With many schools and recreational facilities closing, children have been forced to stay at home, leading to higher levels of screen time and less physical activity. This has created new challenges for parents who are struggling to maintain their work-life balance while ensuring that children remain engaged in healthy activities.\n\nIn conclusion, parenting has undoubtedly become more challenging in our society today due to various factors, including changes in family dynamics, the proliferation of technology, peer pressure and the COVID-19 pandemic. However, good parenting is still necessary to ensure that children grow up with the right values and skills to navigate our complex society. Parents need to adapt and learn new coping mechanisms while remaining vigilant and providing support and guidance to their children in the face of these challenges."

            "human_gen_truncate": "o recruit spies in the US, by posing as businessmen or academics inviting American targets to travel to China for an academic conference or presentation, or a business opportunity. From there, the Chinese agents start building a rapport with their targets and slowly convince them to hand over state secrets. The US is also a victim of Russia'suse of Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Presidential Election that saw the election of Donald Trump\u2014at the time perceived by Russia as their preferred candidate. Exacerbating these problems is the proliferation of \"fake news\", which many experts suspect not only influenced the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Election, but the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK as well. In Singapore, the government passed a new piece of legislation in 2019\u2014the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act\u2014proving that social media poses a serious enough challenge to governments hoping to protect their citizens from malicious content. Additionally, profit-oriented social media companies have a stronger interest in earning profits than adopting responsible behaviour. For instance, users are particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias as online algorithms detect users\" personal opinions based on their online behaviour, and upload relevant posts on their news feed accordingly. Since most people currently receive their daily news from social media platforms, this means that society may become more polarised. Therefore, the unregulated but highly populated \"Wild West\" of social media poses a huge, and likely difficult to solve, challenge for governments as dangerous information circulate widely and quickly among their citizens.\nThe challenges posed by social media to governments may be negligible if they provide them with substantial benefits; however, that is unlikely to be the case. Politicians may find social media useful in helping them directly communicate with their voters. This makes leaders closer to the ground and more relatable. An extreme case happened in Turkey in 2016, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan managed to survive a military coup by appealing to his supporters via a live stream on FaceTime. More typically, politicians use social media to upload photos of milestone events, inform followers of upcoming events, and have a direct line of communication with the public. However, their actions are also heavily scrutinised\u2014any misstep on social media, no matter how slight, could cost them politically. Social media now acts as a check and balance against the government\u2014something like a \"Fifth Estate\" or watchdog exposing governmental wrongdoings. For instance, in 2011, American congressman Anthony Weiner was forced to resign after a sexually suggestive photo he sent to a woman via Twitter was leaked to the public. With the ease in which misinformation can be spread through fabricated or outdated photos, or situations taken out of context, even the most honest and upright government would likely hold some reservations over the positive aspects of social media. Ultimately, most governments would conclude that social media ultimately poses a net challenge, and is largely a necessary evil that has to be managed.\nIn summary, social media is largely a challenge to government as a widely used by highly unregulated platform in which forces of disruption could spread like wildfire. Citizens may be driven to rise up against their leaders, or have their views distorted by outside propaganda. Such problems are threats to national security, and despite the benefits social media brings to governments in connecting with the people, it is safe to conclude that most governments rightly perceive social media as largely a threat that produces only some positive side effects.",

It has given voice and power to the masses by allowing for greater freedom of expression. Social media has created an open platform where anyone can express themselves and share their views and ideas. This has made it difficult for the government to maintain control and has created a platform for dissenting views. Social media tools such as hashtags have allowed for the mobilization of people in ways that would not have been possible before. For example, during the Arab Spring in 2010-2011, social media played a critical role in the organization of mass protests that resulted in regime changes in various countries.\n\nFinally, social media has posed a challenge for the government in terms of cybersecurity. With the increase in social media usage, cybercriminals have become more active and adept at stealing sensitive information from individuals and organizations. Governments are also vulnerable to these threats, as hackers can gain access to sensitive government information, and use it for malicious purposes such as espionage and blackmail.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has created a range of challenges for governments around the world. From creating challenges in regulating content to giving rise to the spread of fake news, social media has posed multiple challenges that many governments are struggling to address. It is crucial for governments to find ways to manage these challenges by implementing policies that can regulate social media content and protect citizens' privacy and security. Social media is here to stay, and governments must learn to adapt to this new reality.",

                "o recruit American spies, academics and think tank members to share confidential information about the United States. The social media platform was used as a means of direct communication to potential targets, creating a challenge for the US government to counter. Additionally, social media platforms have also been used effectively to spread fake news and cyberbullying, which could potentially lead to harm being inflicted on individuals or groups of individuals. In this respect, social media could potentially be seen as a threat to national security, if it spreads hatred or misinformation to such an extent that it leads to physical harm being inflicted on others.\nIn conclusion, social media has been a game-changer in the way people communicate and interact on a large scale. While social media has many benefits, its widespread use and unregulated nature, coupled with the sheer volume of information available, makes it a challenge for governments to regulate and govern. The Arab Spring and the Urumqi Riots in China have proved that social media has the power to affect significant, real-world events\u2014and that is a threat to any government that wants to maintain its stability and control. Additionally, social media can also be used to spread dangerous ideas and fake news, leading to harm being inflicted on individuals, groups or even nations. Given this, it is not far-fetched to say that social media poses more of a challenge to governments than not.",
                "o recruit spies in the United States, in an attempt to gather information on technology and trade secrets. This is just one example of the types of interference that could occur via social media. As such, social media may be used as a tool not just for political opposition, but also generates potential security threats.\n\nIn addition to the challenge of regulating social media use by citizens, there is also the question of regulating the platforms themselves. Social media companies such as Facebook, Google and Twitter have been accused of allowing hate speech, malicious propaganda and fake news to spread on their platforms. These social media companies derive their income largely from advertising and thus have substantial incentives to prioritize traffic and clicks over the consequences of the information they disseminate. This has not been helped by the virtual monopoly these platforms are able to enjoy, where it is often said that Facebook and Google together have more power over the information we receive than the Chinese government. Mark Zuckerberg himself has admitted that Facebook has not done enough to prevent the spread of misinformation on the platform. This means that the threat posed by social media is not only at the individual level but also at the institutional level, where democratic processes could be influenced by fake news and propaganda.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that social media poses challenges to governments in terms of both regulating citizens' use of the platform, as well as regulating the platforms themselves. The widespread reach of social media and its ability to rapidly disseminate information as well as coordinate action means governments may be caught off guard by uprisings or security threats. At the same time, regulating the platform is difficult given the sheer volume of information, the lack of international laws governing social media, and virtual monopolies enjoyed by social media companies. Nevertheless, it is crucial that governments find ways to regulate social media in order to protect their citizens, democracy and security.",
                "o recruit spies in Europe and the United States. LinkedIn is used by many professionals globally to connect with one another from differing fields, and hence is a good cover for intelligence gathering. Governments would have to balance the risks posed by social media against its benefits, but the balance could be precarious, as these risks remain largely unpredictable.\nThat being said, social media does have its benefits. It allows citizens to communicate with their representatives quickly and easily, covering a much larger area than traditionally possible. This could be used to hold officials accountable and highlight concerns. For instance, in Indonesia, social media has become a platform for its citizens to hold their government more accountable. When the Mount Merapi volcano erupted in 2010, people quickly took to Twitter to share real-time updates and offer help to those affected. This eventually led to quicker action being taken by the government, as it showed that citizens were watching and waiting for action to be taken. Social media can also be a platform for marginalised communities to be heard, with the #MeToo movement being a clear example. The movement was initially started by actress Alyssa Milano's tweet in which she encouraged victims of sexual harassment or assault to share their stories on social media by using the hashtag #MeToo. The hashtag soon went viral, and the support for the victims was unprecedented, leading to a rise in public dialogues over the issue.\nIn conclusion, while social media is a powerful platform for communication and the sharing of information, it is also a challenge for governments around the world. With the advent of VPNs and other tools to circumvent regulation, it has become increasingly difficult for governments to control the wide-reaching nature of social media. However, it is important to remember that social media has considerable benefits as well, providing a platform for citizens to hold their officials accountable and give voice to their concerns. Ultimately, governments must learn to adapt to the rapidly-changing landscape of social media or risk being left behind.",
                "o recruit spies and gather intelligence in the United States, a clear indicator that social media was being utilised as a tool for espionage. This highlights just how difficult it is to control the spread of information on social media, especially given that many users are inconspicuous in their activities. This means that the use of social media could lead to real damage for governments both domestically and internationally, whether it is the inciting of individual radicalisation or further escalation of tensions between nations.\nHowever, some may argue that social media offers benefits as well, such as being a source of entertainment or a powerful platform for raising awareness of social issues. For instance, in late 2019, the hashtag \"Me Too\" became a global phenomenon, with victims of sexual harassment and assault sharing their stories. The movement resulted in tangible policy reform in some countries and led to a shift in attitudes towards sexual harassment and assault. Similarly, NGOs like Amnesty International use social media to gather support for their causes, and to hold governments accountable for their human rights records. Moreover, social media helps to facilitate communication between community members, and can be used as an effective crime watch tool, which strengthens community bonds and improves public safety.\nNevertheless, the benefits of social media appear to be heavily outweighed by the challenges that it poses to governments. The sheer volume of information on social media means that regulating it effectively is close to impossible, and its use as a tool for espionage, incitement and radicalisation pose serious threats both domestically and internationally. While social media will likely continue to be a platform for social movements and a source of entertainment and information for the masses, its inherent unpredictability and problematic tendencies mean that it is always going to be an area of concern for governmental agencies.",
                "o recruit spies from among the US diplomatic corp based in Beijing. Just like the Arab Spring, this is an example of how social media could be used to influence people negatively and threaten national security. It is difficult for governments to monitor and control the content on social media platforms as it is relatively easy to create fake accounts and spread propaganda. Moreover, social media algorithms are designed to show users content that aligns with their interests or beliefs\u2014this could lead to information bubbles and echo chambers whereby people are only exposed to certain views and opinions. This limits diversity of thought and could fuel extremism and radical ideologies.\nIn conclusion, social media is undoubtedly a powerful tool that has revolutionized how we communicate, but it also poses significant challenges to governments globally. The volume of information presented, the ease of access, and the unregulated nature mean it is difficult for governments to monitor and control content on these platforms. Social media can be used to negatively impact national security or incite widespread unrest even with the most oppressive of state control. In light of these challenges, there is a need for more stringent regulations on social media, especially in the areas of privacy, accountability and propaganda, as there is a thin line between free speech and social media as a passageway for hate speech and misinformation.",
                "o try to recruit spies from among the U.S. diplomats' contacts. This highlights the vulnerabilities inherent in social media as it may be used as a tool to compromise national security. If social media can be manipulated by foreign governments, it might be impossible for countries to keep their secrets and citizens safe.\n\nHowever, social media's creation of networks and communities is another vital aspect to be taken into consideration as one of the challenges it poses to governments. Social media has the power to create communities that would have been impossible to unite and coordinate before. This is evident in the way organizations such as Black Lives Matter, PETA and Me Too have gained such high profile traction in less time compared to traditional social change movements. Social media plays a significant role in building up and sustaining these groups as they offer a platform to spread awareness of their cause, connecting people from different locations, and providing an organizational structure. This creates a challenge to governments to respond to such movements as they are not beholden to traditional structures and definitions. For example, during the yellow vest protests in France in late 2018, the most significant part of the communication and coordination took place on social media. While it started with a fuel tax increase but soon transformed into a wider social movement, battling President Emmanuel Macron's broader reform agenda. At the height of the protests, the French military was used to maintain order, which generated a polarizing discourse. This reflects the fact that social media can undermine the traditional power structures of political opposition movements, where peaceful dissent is met with state brutality.\n\nIn conclusion, social media's expansion and popularity have brought along numerous challenges for governments, from social uprisings to national security threats, and contributing to the rise of polarising discourse. While it can be a tool for social movements to coordinate and spread awareness of their cause, social media may also undermine stability in a country if it is not well-regulated. It is evident that these challenges that social media brings to governments will not disappear anytime soon, and countries, in turn, must grapple with the ambiguity of social media to ensure stability and prosperity.",
                "o target and recruit spies from within the US government. It is also widely known that Russia actively targeted social media during the 2016 US elections to interfere with the democratic process. Governments need to be vigilant and able to detect these activities, which is a hard task given the sheer volume of social media activity occurring daily.\nRegulating social media content is also a challenge. While it may be effective in stamping out damaging content, regulating social media content is problematic for several reasons. Firstly, social media is a global phenomenon, which means that regulations would need to be agreed upon by different countries, and culturally-appropriate standards would have to be set to ensure fairness while not too stringent as to limit free speech. Secondly, there is the challenge of enforcement - with the huge volume of information on social media, it is impossible for regulators to monitor everything that is posted on it. Finally, the decision on what is acceptable and what is not will always be a judgement call. What may be considered acceptable by some segments of society may be offensive to others. This is a dilemma that all democracy faces, but is made more complex in social media when the global nature of its reach is taken into account.\nIn conclusion, while social media has been a boon to civil society in expanding social networks and the ability of citizens to air their views and opinions, it is a challenge for governments for many reasons. It poses a direct challenge to their authority and represents a potential threat to social order through the quick and widespread coordination of uprisings or the radicalisation of citizens, potentially leading to acts of terror. In addition, foreign governments may use social media to interfere with domestic affairs, and there is the challenge of regulating content on social media. For these reasons, social media represents a profound challenge to state authority and stability.",

Hence, even if social media is not directly used to challenge the government, it could still pose a threat to national security and undermine the stability of a country.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has given citizens unprecedented ability to share information, create communities and organize social movements, but it has also posed a challenge to governments in terms of how to regulate it effectively. The sheer volume of information, unregulated nature of the platforms and foreign ownership make it difficult for regulators to monitor every activity on social media. As such, social media is a \"Wild West\" where misinformation and hatred can spread quickly with little means of control.

The ease of access to social media platforms has led to the spread of fake news at alarming rates, leading to serious consequences. Take the example of the Cambridge Analytica scandal where the misuse of personal data of Facebook's users allowed political parties to carry out targeted campaigns to manipulate public opinion. The spread of fake news on social media platforms could mislead and misinform citizens, leading to them making inadequate decisions, with far-reaching consequences. This is particularly evident in the digital age as most people today obtain their news and information from online sources, making it all the more critical to ensure the authenticity and veracity of such information.\nIn conclusion, the rise of social media has undoubtedly brought about numerous benefits, such as facilitating communication, sharing of information and creating online communities. Still, it has also posed significant challenges for governments worldwide. From mass mobilization against the government to the spread of fake news and interference by foreign governments, governments need to be vigilant and proactive in managing the potential risks that social media poses.

Despite LinkedIn's best effort in screening its users, this suggests that social media could be used in a number of more insidious ways by foreign governments to harm the national security interests of another country.\nWhile social media certainly poses a challenge to governments, there are doubts as to whether they are significant and insurmountable obstacles. Governments can, after all, block access to certain social media platforms altogether, as is the case with China and North Korea. In Singapore, the government has also implemented measures - such as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act - to curb the spread of online falsehoods. Furthermore, social media could also be used as a tool by governments themselves\u2014as an arena where they could engage their citizens and gather feedback, and as a platform to communicate important information to their people. When the novel coronavirus hit in early 2020, Singapore's approach to public communication utilised social media extensively, with daily announcements and clarifications posted on various platforms. In this way, social media could be used as a tool to build trust, and strengthen the social contract between citizens and their government.\nIn conclusion, while social media could undoubtedly pose significant challenges to governments, it is a double-edged sword which could be used to either support or challenge the interests of those in power. As such, thoughtful and balanced regulation is required to ensure that the benefits of social media are maximised while its risks are minimised."

In terms of living spaces, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has installed, as part of the Silver Zone programme, new road safety features at selected locations in five residential areas with a higher proportion of elderly residents \u2014Bedok, Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Marine Parade and Bishan\u2014such as special road signs and markings to demarcate the Silver Zones and traffic calming measures to slow down motorized traffic and enable motorists to keep a better look-out for pedestrians. Positive response for this scheme has prompted the government to expand the project by aiming to revitalize another 15 more estates to become silver zones by 2017 and 35 silver zones by 2020. The government is not the only stakeholder in embracing the old, with Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWOs) in Singapore also playing an integral role in the healthcare of the elderly as seen in the establishment of four community hospitals, two chronic sick hospital, 47 nursing homes and hospices, such as the Assisi Hospice, St Joseph'sHome and Agape Methodist Hospice, 17 day rehabilitation centres and home care services for the elderly. These measures have certainly been successful, as a recent report released by the Institute of Policy Studies indicated that 80% of respondents felt confident about their needs being taken care of and that in general most elderly Singaporeans have little to worry about. It thus seems safe to conclude that Singapore has done much to embrace the old, not only in the workplace, but also in terms of healthcare and living conditions.\nYet, despite numerous efforts to accord the aged with equal rights and ensure that they are well-blended into the society, there are instances where the elderly feel outcast and left behind as the rest continue to move forward. Even the government may slip up at times\u2014in 2017, MediShield Life paid just $4.50 of a senior's$4,477 post-subsidy bail, undermining the very purpose of MediShield Life to keep healthcare affordable to the elderly. The Ministry of Health (MOH) took action not after repeated complaints, but only after The Straits Times published an article on the incident. Among Singapore citizens, many youths and middle-aged workers may, understandably, frown upon the idea of spending vast amounts of resources on the elderly at their expense. This attitude was showcased in the opposition against the construction of a nursing home in Bishan some years back\u201440 residents submitted a petition calling on the government to build the home elsewhere, citing that they were unwilling to give up the football field to make way for the nursing home and to live in close proximity to the aged who would disturb their and tranquillity with their constant groaning. Nonetheless, such cases are mostly isolated, and MOH has also revised its policies to ensure that hospitals cannot overcharge patients and that the elderly can make sufficient claims. Furthermore, the government has over nearly two decades attempted to bridge the gap between the youth and elderly. The Maintenance of Parents Act was passed in 1997 to protect the rights of the elderly and ensure that they are rightfully taken care of by their children financially, making Singapore the only state in the world to legally oblige grown-up children to care for their parents. In July 2002, the Family Matters! Singapore Taskforce on Grandparenting and Inter-generational Bonding was set up to promote activities that foster interaction and bonding between people of different generations and to learn from each other. Such moves are bound to improve understanding between the young and older people and chisel away stereotypes that the elderly are feeble, inactive or of little use to society. This will in turn result in a mindset change and the elderly would be valued by the society.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made great leaps in embracing the old, which are increasingly forming a larger proportion of the population. From keeping them in the workforce to healthcare coverage to suitable living spaces, Singapore does seem to have welcomed the old with open arms as an asset to the country and as people who deserve to be well-taken care of, rather than marginalising them. Nonetheless, there are always gaps, especially in some members of the public'smindsets. On the whole, however, Singapore has indeed created a society largely embracing towards the old.",

While we have policies that aim to improve the well-being of elderly citizens, there is room for improvement. The current cost of living and healthcare system in Singapore leaves many elderly struggling to get by on limited savings, and this may pose a problem as Singapore's population ages.\n\nOne aspect where Singapore has struggled to embrace the old has been in integrating traditional values and practices into modern society. While we have festivals and events that celebrate our heritage, some traditional values may sometimes clash with modern aspirations. A prime example of this is the recent controversy surrounding plans to demolish Golden Mile Complex, an important landmark for the Thai population in Singapore. Many argued that its destruction would symbolize the erasure of traditional cultural spaces. \n\nFurthermore, Singapore's rapid pace of development, urbanisation and globalisation has led to some loss of traditional values and practices. We have become reliant on technology and have lost the art of face-to-face conversations. This reflects a growing trend in young Singaporeans to place more emphasis on western values and modernity than on our cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the degree of success which Singapore has had in embracing the old is subjective and dependent on various factors. While our government has initiated several policies aimed at better care and support for the elderly, challenges remain. Furthermore, while we may celebrate and embrace our cultural heritage and traditions, some may argue that we have not fully integrated these values into modern society. As Singapore moves towards a future of continual development and change, it will be important to continuously balance our cultural heritage with modernity.",

An example of this can be seen in the Housing and Development Board (HDB) upgrading programme which aims to enhance the living environment and facilities for the elderly by installing things such as slip-resistant flooring and support bars in bathrooms. Elderly-friendly facilities such as pedestrian crossings with longer waiting times and bench seats have also been introduced to make it more convenient for the elderly to move around and take rests when necessary. These changes have been widely embraced and are important in allowing the elderly to stay integrated with society and not feel excluded from day-to-day activities.\nIn conclusion, Singapore's efforts to integrate and recognise the value of the elderly in society has brought about positive changes in various aspects of daily life. Through training schemes, healthcare and housing upgrades that cater specifically to elderly needs, the government is sending a clear message that the elderly have a vital role to play in our society, and should not be disregarded or neglected. As a Singaporean, it is heartening to see the strides that have been taken to ensure that our elderly population is well taken care of, and I believe that the fruits of these initiatives will pay off handsomely in the years to come.",
                "crucial, especially since it is widely acknowledged that many the elderly simply cannot afford to fund and support their medical needs as they age.\nPerhaps most encouragingly, Singapore's government also recognises the need to integrate the elderly into society, both to help them feel valued and connected to the wider world, and to help the younger generation better understand their elders and the contributions that they made to society during their younger years. In this sense, the government has taken proactive steps to encourage intergenerational bonding and relationships through a variety of measures. For example, the government has launched the \"Seniors for Smart Nation\" programme, a nationwide initiative targeted at training and preparing the elderly for the digital age, such as using smartphones and other electronic devices, which also serves to create common points of interests and discussion among the young and the old. This initiative is in line with the Smart Nation vision, which seeks to embrace and include all segments of society into a technology-driven future. Other programmes such as the \"Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS)\" and \"National Silver Academy\" also serve as platforms for elderly individuals to connect with like-minded peers and younger generations. All of these reflect the efforts of Singapore's government to strengthen the bond between generations, and ultimately build a more cohesive and inclusive society.\nAll in all, it is heartening to see that Singapore is taking the welfare and interests of the elderly seriously, and working to alleviate the challenges that they face in a rapidly changing and demanding society. From employment policies to healthcare and active ageing programmes, Singapore is making a concerted effort towards creating a sustainable, inclusive and age-friendly society, that will be able to raise the standard of living and quality of life for all citizens, young and old. This signals a positive trend towards a society where the elderly are appreciated and given the recognition they deserve for their past contributions, as well as their continued worth in the present and future.",

For example, under the government\u2019s HDB upgrading programme, new facilities such as ramps and handrails are installed in flats to make homes more user-friendly for seniors. This enables elderly citizens to live more independently, and not be entirely dependent on their younger family members, leading to a better quality of life for them. Furthermore, common living spaces such as void decks and parks which are frequently used by residents of all ages are also being redesigned to cater to the needs of the elderly, for instance, benches with armrests or more covered areas to shield from the sun. All these efforts correspondingly make public spaces more accessible and comfortable for the elderly, leading to wider community acceptance and integration.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made it a priority to ensure that its ageing population receives the care and support that they require. The implementation of initiatives that address the concerns and needs of the elderly has demonstrated a clear shift in mentality towards a society that values the elderly and their contributions.

While many seniors feel isolated and marginalised, the government has recognised the need to foster greater intergenerational understanding and social interaction. One example is the Silver Generation Office that was set up in 2014 to provide employment assistance and care in the community. Similarly, nursing homes have been given a facelift, adopting a more homely and less institutionalised look to create a more comfortable space for the elderly, and more facilities like cafes and shops are being introduced into these settings to promote interaction with the wider community. The Elderly Fitness Programme was also introduced to encourage physical activity and improve the general wellbeing of seniors, as exercise has been shown to reduce healthcare costs and alleviate chronic conditions. Such initiatives demonstrate the government's commitment to integrating the elderly into society and creating a more inclusive Singapore for all.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has taken the welfare of its elderly population seriously, and has introduced a range of policies and programmes aimed at improving their quality of life. By enhancing employability skills, investing in healthcare and promoting social inclusion, the government has created a more equitable and sustainable future for both the elderly and the economy as a whole.

For instance, growing numbers of apartment blocks now come with elder friendly features such as ramps and grab bars in strategic areas to aid mobility and safety. The Housing Development Board (HDB) 'Elder-Friendly Smart Homes' aims to improve the quality of life of seniors by providing them with accessibility, convenience, and safety in their homes. The government's mantra of \"ageing in place\" calls upon society to support the notion that elderly inhabitants remain in their own homes for as long as possible, thus avoiding the financial burden of living in nursing homes. Finally, Singapore has even transformed public installations and areas to ensure that elderly residents can access them easily such as wheelchair ramps for buses and more lift lobbies and corridors to reduce congestion and movement risks for elders. All these are indicative of the government's recognition of the elderly's special needs and their willingness to cater to them so that Singaporeans of all ages can enjoy safe and convenient living.\nTo sum up, Singapore has successfully taken steps to welcome its ageing population and provide them with opportunities and services which formerly would have been unimaginable, making for a more balanced and happy existence for the elderly. Instead of regarding the elderly as a burden, Singapore's efforts serve to give them a seat at the table, ensuring that their talents are not wasted and that their basic needs are met.

In addition, programmes such as the Community Health Assist Scheme (CHAS) subsidises medical and dental care for lower-income elderly Singaporeans and the Silver Support Scheme provides an additional cash supplement for the bottom 20% of Singaporeans aged 65 and above with low to moderate incomes. The implementation of these healthcare programmes have catalysed improvements in quality of life for the elderly and contributed to Singapore's success in being recognised as an age-friendly city by the World Health Organisation in 2019.\nApart from changes in the work force and healthcare system, many aspects in living environments have also been transformed to be more elder-friendly improving their social and mobility needs such as maintenance of proper footpaths, lift upgrades and constructing safe pedestrian crossings. HDB\u2019s Lease Buyback Scheme allows elderly residents to sell part of their remaining lease back to HDB for cash, allowing them to continue living in their flat while monetizing their asset to provide for their retirement. More physical changes include installation of features such as wheelchair ramps, grab bars, and elder-friendly toilet facilities in places like shopping malls and food courts to ensure the elderly can move around easily. The popularity of the community gardens, dotted around HDB estates, reinforces the success of such efforts by showcasing how the elderly stay active and maintained a buoyant social life in this green spaces. Additionally, Singapore has an ever-increasing number of senior citizen centres which form a valuable resource for the elderly, providing opportunities for the elderly to make new friends and engage in activities that highlight their capabilities and interests. An example is \"PA Senior Academy\" which offers classes in various courses like gardening, cooking, language study, digital literacy and even tai chi, thus encouraging the elderly to keep learning, stay engaged and active. These initiatives are powerful meanings of promoting inclusivity and respect for the elderly and reinforce their value in society.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has taken significant steps towards embracing and integrating its elderly citizens into society. From changes in the workplace to better access to healthcare and improving the physical environment, the Singapore government has proved its commitment to the elderly and its recognition that they form an important and valuable part of Singapore society.

Moreover, initiatives have been taken to establish eldercare services in residential areas, thereby making it more convenient for caretakers and senior citizens alike. Such services provide food, medical care, as well as social interactions, giving the elderly a sense of belonging with the community and providing much-needed support and relief to their family members who may have other commitments.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has come a long way in accepting and appreciating the contribution of the elderly to society, acknowledging their needs and addressing their issues. The government's initiatives and policies have created an environment where the elderly are better able to find meaningful work even after retirement age, gain access to quality and affordable healthcare and can live independently for longer. Such policies have elevated the elderly from being neglected members of society to a more valued and appreciated group.

With many elderly citizens living alone and often in smaller flats, it is important that the environment is safe, secure and conducive for the elderly. Over the years, HDB flats have increasingly been designed with elderly-friendly features like grab bars, non-slip bathroom flooring and ramps. The government has also launched various schemes to help senior citizens with their housing needs, such as the Silver Housing Bonus which provides cash incentives for elderly Singaporeans to right-size their homes and the Lease Buyback Scheme which enables seniors to monetise their flats while continuing to live in them. In addition, the government has invested in building more senior activity centres, eldercare centres and nursing homes to provide support and socialisation opportunities for senior citizens. Such facilities aim to tackle the issue of social isolation among the elderly, which can lead to negative health outcomes.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has recognised the value and importance of its elderly citizens.

For instance, HDB flats now have the Lifelong Income For the Elderly (LIFE) scheme, which provides a lifelong income stream on top of CPF payouts, to help them sustain necessities like food and utilities, thus easing the financial burden on the elderly. The government has also built community infrastructures such as senior activity centres, so that the elderly can stay active and involved in society, as well as care centres to provide for those who may require more specialised attention.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly population presents serious demographic challenges, Singapore has taken significant strides to embrace the elderly and cater to their needs.

            "human_gen_truncate": " themselves what they would or would not like to see in media. That said, however, it appears that even with higher levels of education, citizens are unable to discern between falsehoods and facts presented to them: a study published in \"Science\", which analysed more than 126,000 tweets on Twitter, found that a falsehood reaches a group of 1,500 individual users at a rate that is 6 times quicker than a true story does. While increasing literacy rates may suggest a population that is more inclined to think critically, reality suggests otherwise. A more well-educated populace may not necessarily obviate the need for any form of control over the dissemination of information to the public, meaning that the concept of censorship may not be any less valid than it was previously.\nHowever, we must concede that there are certain instances where it is imperative that censorship be present to serve as a moral guide or compass of sorts. Its relevance and function is demonstrated in its ability to protect children from the ills of mass media. Children who are exposed to mass media for long hours become unknowing victims when they are unwittingly exposed to violent or sexual scenes. As such, children, who tend to be impressionable and na\u00efve, are especially vulnerable to the ills of mass media. Due to the egregious impacts of such undesirable material, the need for censorship is legitimate and relevant. While it may be true that information on the Internet is difficult to control, the fact that a task is a Herculean one does not negate the responsibility of ensuring that it is done, especially when it is a necessary one. Age restrictions on movies, such as PG, M-18, NC-16, R-21, prevent young audiences from being exposed to material that is sexually suggestive or where excessive gore could result in unwise decisions. From this, it can be inferred that the need for censorship is justifiable because of the prevalence of questionable or immoral material that could erode the moral fabric of societies.\nIn addition, censoring sensitive issues such as racial or religious issues could prevent ethnic and religious strife. By eliminating such sources of instability, the government surely has the interest of the larger community in mind as social cohesion is of great importance to any country. For example, in Denmark, cartoons that were thought to have blasphemed the Muslin prophet Muhammed outraged the Muslim community worldwide, leading to the situation being blown out of proportion. In Singapore, a number of individuals have been prosecuted under the Sedition Act for posting insensitive racist remarks online. In 2015, the Sedition Act was invoked against Ello Ed Mundsel Bello, a Filipino nurse who disparaged Singaporeans as \"Stinkaporeans\" and \"losers\", and allegedly said that he would \"celebrate\" when \"more Singaporeans die\". Another classic case would be that of Amy Cheong'sracist rant case in 2012, where she disparaged Malays for what she perceived to be their low-cost and lengthy void-deck weddings, and also mocked their divorce rate. In these cases, censorship protects individuals and groups from vitriolic speech designed to intimidate and degrade on the basis of race, religion or language and exacerbate existing fault lines. Considering the benefits of censorship which are legion, the practice of censorship especially in a diverse, multiracial country like Singapore, is without a doubt vital.\nFurthermore, many individuals and corporations remain insensitive and even abusive of its use of mass and social media and have yet to reach a level of responsibility. This only undermines the reliability of mass media and calls for censorship laws to govern and regulate the media, so that it reports what is accurate and objective. With the rise in profit-making corporates running our media such as \"The Sun\" and \"The Daily Star\", sensationalism increasingly pervades our print media. The incessant exaggeration of reports not only clouds the judgement of the readers but also trivializes many important news. it should be acknowledged that mainstream media does also tend towards sensationalism and \"excessive coverage\" in order to sustain their viewership. For instance, following the release of a report on carcinogenic processed meat by the World Health Organization, mainstream media coverage of the report and its contents were overblown and often distorted the findings of the report. Even the Straits Times is guilty of sensationalizing reports of crime. This is presumably because mainstream media sources, especially those which use online mediums, tend to sensationalize important news to get \"clicks and likes\", which in turn drives up their advertisement revenue. The lack of journalistic integrity points to the need for some type of control over the information which is presented to the public, to prevent the false propagation of information, especially for news media as people ought to feel reassured that they need accurate news.\nOn a final note, despite the slew of problems that censorship brings about and its diminishing necessity in society, the exercise of censorship is essential and well-founded. However, with the increasing dominance of new media, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor everything. Hopefully with education and the cooperation of the public to utilize the internet responsibly, we can ensure that we do not end up like the dystopian society presented in \"Fahrenheit 451\" where the free flow of information wreaks havoc.",

Firstly, censorship can be used to protect vulnerable populations from harmful or distressing content. For example, censoring videos depicting graphic violence or suicide may be necessary to protect the mental health of young people.\n\nMoreover, I believe that when it comes to national security, censorship can be necessary to prevent the spread of sensitive information that could put the country at risk. There are some situations in which government officials may need to keep information secret in order to protect the safety of its citizens.\n\nHowever, censorship must be used sparingly and with caution. It is important that censorship is not used as a tool to suppress free speech or limit the range of opinions that can be expressed. In situations where censorship is used, transparent guidelines and protocols must be established and applied in a fair and unbiased manner.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship is a contentious issue, it can be justifiable in certain circumstances. By protecting vulnerable populations and national security, censorship can be used as a tool to promote social harmony and safety. However, censorship must be used carefully and judiciously to ensure that it does not become a means of suppressing free speech or limiting the diversity of ideas that can be expressed.",

In this regard, censorship sets a dangerous precedent for government control and manipulation of opinion.\nHowever, despite the factors that question the necessity of censorship, it cannot be denied that certain topics do warrant a certain degree of censorship. For instance, in countries with diverse cultural backgrounds like Singapore, certain offensive content like hate speech, pornography, and religious extremist propaganda could threaten social stability and national security. Therefore, while censorship must be minimized to prevent information control and manipulation, it should be used judiciously in contexts where it can help preserve social harmony and national security.\nIn conclusion, censorship has been a contentious topic that is debated on multiple levels, from its role in protecting the values of society to it being seen as a tool for manipulation and information control. While it remains an essential tool to prevent the proliferation of discriminatory content, censorship should not be used to stifle or control public discourse, nor should it infringe on our right to freedom of information. Ultimately, it is important to strike a balance between the need to promote free speech and free information while ensuring that censorship is judiciously used to maintain social stability and national security.",
                "themselves what they want to be exposed to, and what they want to believe. Governments may argue that they are merely concerned with protecting their citizens from what they consider to be harmful or dangerous media content, but the line between what counts as harmful and what is merely uncomfortable or unpopular is a blurred one. When governments use censorship as a screen to protect their own interests, it is a clear abuse of power. Such governmental interventions can be seen as an infringement on basic human rights, which include freedom of speech, expression, and information. In a democracy, it is important that the populace is free to engage in open debate and discussion, and censorship hinders this exchange of ideas. Dynamic democracies require a diversity of voices and perspectives, which would not be possible without the freedom of expression. It is for this reason that the role of censorship should be minimized or eradicated in our modern context.\n\nIn conclusion, censorship in today's world is contentious, as it necessitates a balance between protecting people from harmful or offensive material, and allowing them the freedom to access a broad range of opinions and ideas. While censorship may be viewed as a necessary tool for some regimes, it is largely incompatible with the democratic values of transparency, open debate and the freedom of expression. It is important that governments facilitate the provision of accurate, informative and representative media content, rather than attempting to impose their own narratives or censoring those which do not conform to their own agendas. At the end of the day, the decision as to what to watch, read or listen to, should ultimately lie with the populace, and they ought to be given the liberty to interpret and make their own decisions. In a world that is increasingly connected and reliant on media and information, it is critical that we strive for a society that values open communication, honesty and the free flow of ideas.",
                "themselves, what information they wish to consume and what they do not. The rise of citizen journalism and social media has further diversified the voices and opinions that are available to the public. Through these platforms, those who have been traditionally marginalized are given an avenue to speak up and be heard. For instance, in the Arab Spring, citizens of authoritarian countries were able to use social media to broadcast their message to the wider world. Social media also provides an avenue for intercultural exchange, allowing people from diverse communities to learn from one another. Through this, a more socially aware populace can emerge, one that is capable of engaging with issues fully and constructively.\nFurthermore, inflexible censorship laws may actually stifle creativity, and result in the regression of society. Censorship could prevent the flourishing of art and literature in society, due to the imposition of arbitrary restrictions. Conversely, aspects of society that were once considered taboo such as sex education, have now been acknowledged as crucial. In order to educate people about the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases, sex education is now actively included in school curriculums. For these reasons, it can be argued that a censorship-free society is not only permissible, but also ideal.\nIn conclusion, while censorship has the potential to be used as a promising protective mechanism, it also has the potential to be a powerful tool for propaganda and social control. It is important to note the the existence of censorship does not automatically imply a lack of freedom, as censorship operates in a continuum, and the degree of censorship necessary for a society is context-dependent. In Singapore's context, although censorship appears to have been rigid in the past, we see it becoming less pervasive and more flexible. It is becoming increasingly transparent, and more accommodating towards alternative viewpoints and narratives. This is reflected in the gradual relaxation and re-evaluation of laws that were once thought to be draconian, such as the \"Out of Bounds Markers\" in Singapore. Therefore, the fight for absolute freedom of information is not only impractical, but unnecessary. We must find a balance between the need for transparency and the need to protect the public from harmful material. Ultimately, the value of free speech lies not in an extreme position, but in striking a harmonious balance, between preserving social order and promoting progress.",
                "themselves what they want to read, watch or listen to. This is especially true in the era of citizen journalism, where individuals can obtain news and information from a variety of sources. However, this increase in access to information does not necessarily guarantee that individuals are able to critically evaluate all the information they receive, which is where the danger of manipulation arises. In addition, the rise of fake news and disinformation has made it more challenging for individuals to discern what is true, and such media manipulation can be disastrous in situations where public opinion can affect national policy decisions, like in the case of Brexit and the US presidential elections.\n\nTo conclude, it is clear that the issue of censorship in media has both merits and drawbacks. While censorship may have been a necessary evil in the past, the current literate and educated populace may no longer need it to protect them. However, the rise of disinformation and manipulation in the media still poses a significant risk to modern society, and it is essential that measures are taken to counter such threats. Ultimately, the best solution may lie in striving for transparency in media representation and empowering individuals with critical viewing skills to make informed decisions about the information they receive.",
                "themselves what they believe in, rather than be told what to think. Similarly, the rise of citizen journalism and new media platforms has given individuals a platform to share their perspectives and voice their opinions. They are no longer restricted by mainstream media platforms when it comes to accessing information, and they are able to circumvent censorship by uploading information on social media platforms, enabling other users to access it. This has led to a more diverse range of perspectives on various issues, and has enabled people to have a more nuanced understanding of events that are happening around the world.\nHowever, the rise of increasing fake news and biased reporting has shown that censorship may still be necessary to ensure that the public is not misled or misinformed about certain issues. Fake news can have serious consequences, and can result in wrong decisions being made, the sowing of discord and the spread of rumours which can lead to hysteria and social unrest. This is why social media platforms have recently implemented measures to tackle the spread of fake news. While these measures can be seen as censorship, it is a necessary step to ensure that only accurate information is disseminated. Similarly, media reporting which is biased or slanted can also mislead readers into believing certain misconceptions, and can lead to tensions between different groups of people. This is why media regulation is necessary to ensure that an unbiased and balanced reporting is made available to the public, which enables them to make informed decisions.\nIn conclusion, while there may be some arguments for a completely censorship-free society, it appears that the need for censorship in today's modern context is still relevant and necessary. The rise of technology and the education of the populace has enabled people to become more discerning with the information they receive, but the presence of biased reporting and fake news still necessitate measures to ensure that the information disseminated is accurate and unbiased. Therefore, censorship should not be seen as an evil practice that stifles free speech, but rather as a tool that is necessary in maintaining the well-being and development of society.",
                "themselves what information they should be exposed to and to what extent. This empowerment of individuals with a say in their own consumption of information and narratives should reduce the need for censorship which may be viewed as outdated and unnecessary in the 21stcentury.\nHowever, while education and media literacy may have increased, it is undeniable that the proliferation of new media and social networks has led to a deluge of information inundating individuals daily. This makes it difficult for individuals to separate the wheat from the chaff, and discern what information is accurate and what is not. With the rise of 'deepfakes', which could easily manipulate video or audio footage and create fake news and propaganda, individuals may unknowingly consume false information. This may then lead to the proliferation of fake news stories which have real-world consequences, as seen in the 2016 United States presidential campaign, among other examples. As such, some form of censorship may be necessary to protect the population from such manipulations of what's \"real\" and what's not. In Singapore, the presence of legislation such as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA), which aims to combat the spread of fake news and online falsehoods, may be viewed as a necessary measure to prevent misinformation from becoming widespread in society. While there are criticisms surrounding POFMA, such as the effectiveness of it in silencing critics of the ruling party or the government, it's existence as a form of media regulation protects the population from being misled.\nIn conclusion, censorship remains a contentious issue today, as it was in the world of \"Fahrenheit 451\". While censorship may be necessary to protect a country and its people from harmful information, the rise of media and information literacy among citizens makes it less necessary compared to previous years. However, the rise of fake news and the ability to manipulate the masses through new media does present real-world consequences, and censorship laws may need to be adapted to meet these challenges while still protecting and preserving the right to free speech and expression in today's society.",
                "themselves whether information is credible or not. Censorship may therefore be seen, not just as an obstacle to freedom of speech, but also one that stunts intellectual development, as a society without viewpoints that conflict with the mainstream narrative will be unable to form independent opinions and thus promote intellectual growth. In a cognitive sense, the presence of censorship may also breed ignorance, as the lack of discourse surrounding controversial issues may mean that people are unable to form an informed opinion about such issues, rendering them unable to meaningfully contribute to a discourse.\nHowever, despite the drawbacks of censorship, it cannot be denied that certain forms of censorship are necessary. Countries that are still in their formative stages, that has not yet gained the confidence to handle free speech and the free flow of information, may still require some measure of censorship. Censorship may be useful in providing some form of protection against the spread of fake news or propaganda, and to help prevent the spread of disinformation. In such instances, the censorship regime should be relatively transparent, and people should be made aware of the reasons behind the censorship. For example, some governments have evolved from authoritarian regimes to democratic states, and have thus adopted relatively liberal stances on censorship. This is seen in nations like South Korea and Taiwan, which until the 1980s were still under authoritarian rule but have since opened themselves up to form a free press. Ironically, in such states, authoritarian measures which were initially in place to protect the government against the spread of harmful information have been adapted for use in a democratic setting. It was the Transparency and Freedom of Information Act (1998) in South Korea that in 2001 publicly disclosed a state plot to bomb the first inter-Korean summit that led to the landmark summit between President Kim Dae-jung and North Korean leader Kim Jong-Il which jumpstarted the Sunshine Policy.\nIn conclusion, censorship remains a complex issue, and its implications are far-reaching. While it is necessary for governments to protect their people from harmful content, there is also a need to be transparent about the information policies that are put in place. Governments should aim to strike a balance between protecting their citizens and empowering them to form opinions, and not just blindly accept whatever is fed to them. The need for censorship is therefore context-specific, as it depends on the political, cultural and economic environment that the society in question finds itself in. Ultimately, it is through education and transparency, not censorship, that a society will attain the level of maturity required to handle the free flow of information and ideas.",

With the advent of modern technology and an increasingly well-educated population, censorship only serves to control and manipulate the flow of information, rather than to protect the welfare of society. Countries that continue to wield censorship as a tool of control and hegemony risk perpetuating ignorance and fuelling misunderstanding, thereby ultimately undermining the fundamental values of democracy and the integrity of the free world. As such, it is imperative that we continue to fight for our right to free and unrestricted access to information, as this is the key to a more informed and enlightened society.",

These observations, however, fail to take into account the global rise of disinformation and the various forms of fake news that is being propagated. This rise calls into question the ability of individuals and society to be responsible enough to discern fact from fiction and thus leads to the discussion of whether censorship remains relevant in modern society.\nIn conclusion, the debate over censorship versus a free press can be summarised by the extent to which it should be allowed to occur. In the modern context, censorship plays an important role as a protective mechanism, to prevent the spread of harmful and false information. However, it is important to note that censorship can also be used as a political weapon to suppress views that are critical of the government or that challenge the existing status quo. While censorship may have its benefits, it should be used sparingly, with the aim of protecting the public from harmful information. At the same time, the rise of fake news and disinformation calls into question whether society is equipped to handle an uncensored media environment. Ultimately, a balance must be struck between censorship and a free press, that is responsible, transparent, and capable of providing the public with truthful information. Only then can the public be assured that they are able to think independently, form their own opinions, and make informed decisions.",

In today's modern context, there is a strong argument to be made against censorship, as education and an individual's ability to think critically have both improved, rendering censorship an unnecessary measure in protecting society from controversial viewpoints. Instead, mass media should provide authentic, transparent accounts of events and ideas, so that people are equipped with the information they need to form their own opinions. Only by promoting such an open-minded attitude towards free speech and expression can societies move forward towards greater progress and harmony."

            "human_gen_truncate": "field of genetic engineering which seeks to modify the genetic makeup of an organism, it appears that science has allowed man to play God, and play God we have. In February 2016, the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority authorised the editing of genomes in human embryos using CRISPR technology for \"research purposes\". In 2019, barely 3 years later, Professor He Jiankui announced that he had altered the DNA of a pair of twins to prevent them from contracting HIV.This could transform the concepts of designer babies and eugenics into a frightening reality. Aldous Haxley's\"Brave New World\" describes a dystopian world where infants are grown in vats and sorted according to their intelligence levels. Even back in 1937, when the novel was first published, the fear of dehumanization and infringing upon the sanctity of human life was already gaining traction among readers.  Does having power alone make us \"arrogant\"? Not necessarily as it can be argued that it is the inability to set limits on our growing powers that constitutes arrogance. Although there is considerable academic debate about the ethical considerations of genetic engineering and authorities are moving to regulate this growing field, it appears that we have arrived at a stage where the ethical debates arising from CRISPR are severally left behind by technological advancement. According to a 2009 report released by the United Nations, 133 out of 192 nations lacked an adequate regulatory framework for the regulation of genetic modification technologies. In the wise words of Jean Rostand, a French biologist and philosopher: \"Science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being man.\" We now hold the biological building blocks of human life in our hands, which can be parlayed according to one'swhim and fancy \u2013 potentially undermining the sanctity of human life \u2013 and we have made insufficient efforts to understand and control the extent of our influence.\nGiven that modern science has allowed us to play God, it appears that our arrogance extends to asserting superiority over the other species which populate the Earth. Much has been said about how mankind uses animals for scientific experimentation, but modern science has even given mankind an opportunity to clone animals for the purpose of scientific advancement, food, environmental reasons, and even for man'ssentimentality. Pet cloning, which reunites owners with carbon copies of their beloved but deceased pets, is now a burgeoning international industry, which has grown by leaps and bounds since the first dog was cloned at the Seoul National University in 2005. Scientists and pet owners alike pay scant regard to the fact that 90% of fertilised embryos implanted in surrogate mothers either fail to implant, or spontaneously abort, or result in \"serious or fatal issues perinatally\", with disastrous effects on the health of the surrogate mothers. This is a prime example of the moral conceit and flagrant disregard for non-human life that sets in following the advent of technological advancement. Scientists have successfully genetically modified Aqua Atlantic Salmon such that it can grow much faster in order to meet the rising demand. The invention of fish that glow as a result of an insertion of a genetic element that causes the fish to fluoresce, is used to detect pollutants in water. Mankind has reached a stage where we can flagrantly transform entire animal species just for our selfish purposes without qualms as to whether these interventions impact the entire ecosystem in pernicious ways. Therefore, modern science poses the serious threat of mankind constructing an artificial environment, against the workings of nature.\nIn summary, though modern science has taught mankind to accept our limited knowledge about some secrets of the universe, it has enabled us to take pride in the ability to carry out research and experimentation that cross the ethical boundaries and jeopardise human safety. Hence, modern science poses the threat of making mankind supremely arrogant more than teaching us humility, and  the path to disaster may not be too far away if we do not rein in our scientific hubris.",

While genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases, it also raises the question of whether it is ethical to create \"designer babies.\" Such an act denies the value of life and undermines the fundamental principles of human dignity and humility.\n\nIn order to mitigate these dangers, we need to adopt a more humble approach to science. We need to acknowledge that there will always be things beyond our understanding, and the universe will always hold mysteries beyond our comprehension. We must recognize that we need to work with nature rather than trying to control or manipulate it. We need to take responsibility for the planet and adopt sustainable and eco-friendly practices.\n\nMoreover, we need to learn to use science responsibly. While advancements in science have the potential to improve our lives, we must also remember that every action has a consequence. We must consider the impact of our actions on future generations, and we must make ethical choices. We need to recognize that every individual's life is valuable and that we are mere mortals in the face of the forces of nature.\n\nIn conclusion, the advancement of modern science has made us arrogant by giving us the illusion of control over nature and our bodies. However, we must remember that there is still much we don't understand, and we must approach science with humility.

                "biological building blocks of life, modern science has granted us an unprecedented level of power. With the advent of gene-editing technology, we now possess the ability to precisely edit the genetic code of all living organisms, including humans. While this technology holds immense potential for treating genetic diseases and improving human longevity, it is also fraught with ethical dilemmas. The dangers of eugenics, designer babies, and the creation of genetically modified organisms are all too real. In fact, such practices are already being carried out in countries such as China. The lack of a global consensus on the ethics of gene-editing leaves us vulnerable to the hubris of man-made gods who think they have the right to play with the fundamental building blocks of life.\n\nIn conclusion, modern science has granted mankind an immense amount of power, but this power must be wielded with humility and caution. The scientific method is rooted in skepticism and humility, and scientists themselves know that they are only scratching the surface of the vast unknown. Therefore, it is our responsibility as human beings to recognize the limits of our knowledge and power and exercise restraint in our pursuit of scientific advancements. The dialogue between man and gods may have ended, but our quest for knowledge should be guided by the belief that we are only small parts of something much larger than ourselves. After all, as philosopher Immanuel Kant once said, \"Two things fill the mind with ever new and increasing admiration and awe - the starry heavens above me and the moral law within me.\"",
                "manipulation of the biological building blocks of life, the concept of \"playing God\" is particularly relevant. Genetic engineering, the ability to manipulate the genes of living organisms, has opened up untold opportunities in terms of curing diseases, improving crop yields and increasing longevity, amongst many other potential benefits. At the same time, genetic engineering has also presented mankind with new ethical dilemmas. A notable example is the engineering of human embryos, which could potentially lead to the creation of \"designer babies\"; this technology has been favoured by some parents who want their children to possess certain genetic traits. While this could conceivably lead to the eradication of certain diseases, the larger question that arises is whether it is moral to manipulate human life in such a way. This is just one example of the many ethical questions posed by scientific advancement, and it highlights the fact that the power granted to mankind by science can often lead to moral quandaries.\nFinally, man's ability to decide the fate of all other forms of life on this planet is perhaps the most egregious example of our arrogance. Humans have, for centuries, exploited the earth's natural resources at an unsustainable pace, and as a result, we have brought about the sixth mass extinction in the history of life on earth. The International Union for Conservation of Nature estimates that one in four mammal species, one in eight bird species, one in three amphibian species and 70% of the world's assessed plants on the 2020 Red List are in danger of extinction. This is a direct result of human-led habitat destruction, pollution, and overexploitation of resources. The fact that we continue to do so, despite the knowledge of the devastation this causes, exemplifies our hubris towards the natural world that sustains us.\nIn conclusion, while scientific advancement has undoubtedly conferred immense power upon humankind, it is critical that we remain mindful of our limitations. Science has shown us the extent of our ignorance, and the potential consequences of our actions. Rather than be complacent, we should strive to be humble in the face of the unknown, and operate with a sense of moral responsibility. Only then can we hope to wield the power we have been granted in a way that does not harm our fellow beings, the earth's biodiversity or our planet as a whole.",
                "manipulation of the biological building blocks of life, science has granted us unprecedented power over the natural world. With the advent of genetic engineering, we can now tinker with the very essence of life itself, and this has not come without consequences. For example, genetic engineering has been used to produce crops that are resistant to pests, which has led to increased crop yields. However, the indiscriminate use of pesticides and herbicides has had detrimental effects on the environment, and the long-term effects of genetic modification on the crops themselves are not fully understood. Similarly, gene editing has been used to treat genetic disorders, but it can also be used to create \"designer babies\", which has sparked controversy over the ethical implications of such practices. The power to manipulate biological life forms has therefore given us a level of control over the natural world that was once unimaginable, but the consequences of this power are not yet fully understood, and the potential for unintended consequences is high.\nPerhaps the most concerning manifestation of our technological prowess is the threat we pose to other forms of life on this planet. Climate change, which is largely driven by human activity, threatens to wipe out entire species of plants and animals, and is causing massive disruption to ecosystems around the world. Deforestation and habitat destruction are also major threats to biodiversity, and are often driven by human development projects. In short, our technological advancements have put us in a position where we have the power to destroy life on this planet, and the fact that we have continued to do so despite overwhelming evidence of its consequences speaks to our hubris and arrogance.\nIn conclusion, while science has given us unprecedented power over the natural world, it has also reminded us of our insignificance in the grand scheme of things. The objective of scientific research is to produce accurate explanations of how the natural world works, but the very process of scientific discovery humbles us by confronting us with the sheer perplexity of the unknown. However, if we ignore this fundamental premise of the scientific method, we risk becoming arrogant and using our technological advancements to control our fellow beings and manipulate the natural world with scant regard for our humanity and the long-term consequences of our actions. To avoid this, we must approach science with humility and with a commitment to using our knowledge and power responsibly.",
                "environment and other forms of life, we have also abused our power. The scientific method has allowed us to manipulate the building blocks of life, such as the genes in plants and animals, and in so doing, we have modified the very essence of other forms of life on this planet. While this has brought about an abundance of benefits, it has also meant that we play God with other forms of life. We have changed the way in which other forms of life interact and coexist with one another, and the end result may be a total ecological catastrophe. We have encroached upon natural habitats, driven many species to extinction, and polluted our air and water without proper regard for the far-reaching consequences of our actions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the power accorded to man by scientific advancements has certainly brought about a plethora of benefits, we must be mindful of the limit of our knowledge and the need to exercise moral responsibility. The fact that science does not provide us with answers, but only insights, should keep us humble and cautious. We must be accountable for our actions, and consider the environmental and ethical implications of our quest for knowledge. It is only when we do so that science can truly be a force for good in the world.",
                "biological building blocks of life, modern science has enabled us to manipulate genes in the creation of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), which have been met with varying degrees of resistance. Critics argue that manipulating the genetic makeup of organisms can have unforeseen consequences on ecosystems; on the other hand, proponents assert that genetic engineering is necessary to protect crops from pests and disease and increase the yield of crops to prevent worldwide food shortages. Despite the ongoing debates on the ethics of genetic engineering, there is no doubt that modern science has granted humans unprecedented control over the nature of life itself, but at what cost?\nFinally, modern science has given humans the power to decide the fate of all life on this planet through our actions. Climate change, brought about by human activities, poses an existential threat to all life on Earth, and the indiscriminate destruction of natural habitats is causing the loss of biodiversity at an alarming rate. While modern science has allowed us to understand the consequences of our actions, ignorance or a lack of political will often prevents us from taking proactive steps to avoid an ecological catastrophe, leading to an undeniable loss of biodiversity and habitat destruction. It is only when we understand the limits of our power and when we start to humbly recognize the havoc which we have wrought on this planet can we start to rectify the problem.\nIn conclusion, while modern science has granted us tremendous power, we need to recognize the limits of that power and our own limitations as human beings. As our knowledge of the universe expands, what we do not know far exceeds what we do. As such, arrogance is unwarranted, and humility, crucial. Scientific discovery is a slow and laborious empirical process, and our knowledge of the universe can only expand slowly with each new discovery. We must remain ever-humble in the face of our limited knowledge and continue to responsibly use our tools of scientific discovery to protect and preserve the planet we call home.",
                "environment and other forms of life on Earth, man's immodesty is no less apparent. Our technological advancements have allowed us to manipulate and modify the natural world in unprecedented ways, leading to widespread deforestation, climate change and pollution. Instead of preserving and respecting the intricate balance of nature, man has chosen to exploit and destroy it with utter disregard for the future of our planet. Animals, too, have been subjected to cruel scientific experiments, as well as the degradation of their natural habitats. From genetic modification of crops, to fracking and oil spills, to the innumerable forms of pollution, our arrogance has not only damaged our planet but also jeopardized the existence of several species.\n\nIn conclusion, while scientific research has the potential to uncover wondrous mysteries about the world we live in, we must be cautious of the power that science affords us. The objective of scientific knowledge must always be to benefit humanity, not exploit or degrade it. As much as modern science has granted us the power of gods, we must remain humble as we endeavour to make the world a better place.",
                "manipulation of the biological building blocks of life, the potential for abuse is even greater. With the advancement of genetic engineering, cloning, and other biotechnologies, we now have the ability to create new forms of life and modify existing ones at will. These technologies have the potential to cure diseases, increase food production, and bring about positive changes in our world. However, the same technologies can also be used to create designer babies, engineer diseases, and alter the very nature of life itself. Once we start playing God with life, is it a slippery slope to determine how far we can go before we can no longer determine the consequences it will bring?\nMoreover, our impact on the environment is equally worrying, given that we have made decisions that affect the fate of all other forms of life on this planet. The rapid population growth, overconsumption of resources, and environmental pollution that is direct result of human activity has created potentially irreversible harm to the environment and to ourselves. Climate change, the loss of biodiversity, and the destruction of natural habitats are direct consequences of human activity, and we are facing the consequences of our nonchalant ignorance. Although we have the power to mitigate these dire consequences, our arrogance in wielding the power of modern science has gotten in the way of making the difficult decisions that we need to make to save our planet.\n\nIn conclusion, the power granted to man by modern science is immense, and the consequences of how we wield it are equally immense. While science has humbled us by proving how little we know about the universe, we have also misused it to control our fellow human beings, manipulate the biological building blocks of life, and potentially determine the fate of all other forms of life on this planet. If we continue to ignore the premise of the scientific method, the pursuit of knowledge and the humility it brings, we risk creating a dystopian future where man's desire for power, control and convenience will come at a great cost. It is up to us to use our scientific knowledge for the greater good of all and not let our arrogance govern our actions and decisions.",
                "biological building blocks of life, the power we wield is even more immense. We have learnt how to manipulate genes and create synthetic organisms, and some have suggested that we may one day even conquer death itself. The power to control life and death is a heady one, and we must be cautious about how we use it. We must ask ourselves what right we have to play God and determine the fate of other forms of life on this planet. Many have pointed out that our responsibility lies not just in our ability to control the natural world, but also in our obligation to protect it. This power, coupled with a sense of moral responsibility, can be used to achieve great things, from curing deadly diseases to mitigating climate change.\n\nThe power that modern science has granted us is incredible, but it is important that we do not let it go to our heads. We must remember that there is still much that we do not know, and that our knowledge is always incomplete. It is also crucial that we wield this power with great care and responsibility, and not allow ourselves to be blinded by our own arrogance. In the end, it is our actions that define us, not our scientific achievements.",
                "even more severe ethical quandaries that modern science and technology have brought about, the extinction of various forms of life on this planet being one such example, humanity has also shown itself to be woefully irresponsible. We are wiping out species faster than ever before, with a significant amount of that loss being permanently irreversible, and yet we continue to exploit nature and all its resources relentlessly. While we may be able to justify our actions on the grounds of supposed economic progress and human development, the fact remains that we are wilfully destroying the natural environment upon which we depend for our survival, and doing so with brazen disregard for the consequences. It is bitterly ironic that with all the advancements that science has brought about, we now find ourselves caught in a situation where we have become our own worst enemy.\nThe hubris we have displayed as a species is maybe our greatest failing, and one that cannot be remedied easily. The only way forward is to acknowledge our limitations, be it scientific or moral, and work tirelessly towards redemption. Science is not inherently evil; it is how we choose to apply scientific knowledge that makes all the difference. We must learn to use our knowledge ethically and responsibly, to find ways to harness the transformative power of modern science without being blinded by arrogance and conceit. To quote John F. Kennedy: \"For in the final analysis, our most basic common link is that we all inhabit this small planet. We all breathe the same air. We all cherish our children's futures. And we are all mortal.\" If we are to make progress in the right direction, it is this commonality that we must keep at the forefront of our minds at all times.",
                "manipulation of the biological building blocks of life, such as the genetic modification of crops, the creation of new animal species, and the human cloning, it is nearly impossible to ignore the hubris involved in these actions. The very idea of changing the fundamental blueprint of living organisms and creating new life forms is nothing short of playing God. And yet, we continue to pursue these advancements with little regard for the potential consequences. In 2018, Chinese scientist He Jiankui shocked the world by announcing that he had successfully edited the genes of twin baby girls to make them resistant to the HIV virus. This has sparked a fierce debate about the ethics of genetic editing and whether we should be playing with the building blocks of life without fully understanding the long-term effects.\nFurthermore, humanity's domination over the environment has enabled us to cause untold damage to the natural world. Our consumption of fossil fuels has led to global warming, which threatens to decrease the biodiversity of our planet to an extent that could lead to mass extinction. The destruction of natural habitats has caused the extinction of countless species, and pollution has led to the decimation of entire ecosystems. All of these actions are a product of our arrogant belief that we have the right to exploit and manipulate the natural world for our own gain.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that scientific research has the potential to lead to incredible advancements and improve the quality of life for people around the world, it is important that we approach these discoveries with humility and an understanding of the immense responsibility that comes with the power they provide. The hubris that has led to mankind's exploitation of our fellow beings, the environment, and the very building blocks of life is a reflection of the many ways in which we have ignored the fundamental premise of the scientific method and the incredible power that it offers. We must recognize the limits of our knowledge and power, and remember that we are not gods, but fallible human beings with a moral responsibility to act with wisdom, compassion, and humility."

            "human_gen_truncate": "holders in developing countries should not be ignored. Developing countries have a part to play in protecting the environment as they are currently industrializing and are the main contributors to pollution and environmental degradation in today'sworld. That said, there have been instances where several developing nations have taken the initiative to mitigate environmental degradation via a myriad of ways. These include political involvement, policymaking, and conducting campaigns to raise public awareness, as well as ecotourism. Morocco, a developing country in North Africa, has demonstrated the political will to mitigate climate change by committing to ambitious targets, like having 42% of installed electricity production capacity come from renewable energy sources by 2020, and 52% by 2030. It has demonstrated that it is on track to meet its 2020 target and is poised to meet its 2030 target. As a result, it has been accorded the \"1.5 Degrees Celsius Paris Agreement-compatible\" rating by Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis produced by three climate organisations tracking climate change since 2009. There are also times when governments and organisations attempt to balance economic growth with environmental protection in the form of ecotourism. A country that is currently reaping the benefits of this form of sustainable development would be Belize, a country in Central America. In addition to the 36% of land mass that is protected in Belize, 13% of its water, including vast portions of the world'ssecond largest coral reef system, are protected as well. Efforts in the public sector also supplement the existing community-based projects that aid in boosting sustainable tourism in Belize. Within the Belize Barrier Reef, for example, the gorgeous atoll of Glover'sReef has been maintained as a \"no-take\" marine reserve, a sanctuary where fishing is prohibited. In a place threatened by illegal fishing and overfishing, this unique stretch of reef helps promote natural biodiversity. This therefore highlights that developing countries can still ensure economic growth without sacrificing the environment. Environmental damage can be mitigated with sufficient political will and public awareness, coupled with companies that are willing to play a part in environmental conservation and hence the efforts made by developing countries should be valued and taken into account when considering the stakeholders.\nWe have seen the various stakeholders act separately to conserve the environment. However, the ideal approach in tackling ecological damage should be through international collaboration, especially between governments from various countries, irrespective of developmental status. As their citizens become increasingly vocal about environmental problems, governments have to improvise, adapt and overcome existing and up and coming challenges. It is heartening to note that there have been increased international collaboration, as evidenced by the proliferation of political platforms and solutions such as the climate conferences, environmental summits, declarations and protocols. These have been established to facilitate discussions to deliberate and harness long-term objectives and to implement effective programmes to protect the environment. While many are sceptical of these meetings as many climate conferences like the Copenhagen Climate Conference and the Cancun Climate Conference have ended on a sour note, recently, the different countries have decided to put aside their differences and attempt to take ownership and responsibility of their actions, with the developed countries understanding the needs of developing countries and helping them. This harmonious collaboration was well-demonstrated during the \"COP21\" \u2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, when delegates from 196 countries agreed to the Paris Agreement. The agreement, which is the world'sfirst comprehensive agreement on climate change, was introduced with the objective of keeping the global average temperature increase to below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, by reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 20%, increasing the market share of renewable energy sources to 20%, and increasing energy efficiency by 20%. It was especially significant that the US publicly recognized its role in creating the problem of environmental devastation and finally embraced its responsibility to settle it by pledging to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025. China also followed suit by instilling a target of 20% non-fossil fuels in its overall energy composition by 2030, with additional targets to reduce carbon and energy intensity. Moreover, the Paris Climate Accord is a comprehensive international agreement where under the deal, countries must publish greenhouse gas reduction targets and revise them every 5 years. This agreement ultimately aims to attain a carbon-neutral world before 2100. This therefore reiterates the motion that international collaborations are also considered to be vital in mitigating the pernicious effects of climate change and environmental exploitation, in addition to the efforts made by developed countries.\nIn summary, while it must be conceded that developed countries have a greater expertise to handle environmental concerns, their efforts alone will definitely fall short in the long run as it must be understood that all of us live in an interconnected world where the flap of a butterfly'swings can engender a storm halfway around the world. Therefore, everyone has a part to play in preventing further environmental degradation from developing countries on a macro-level, to individuals and small NGOs, on a micro-scale, and their responsibilities and actions should not be simply dismissed as inconsequential and insignificant. Therefore, the claim that the fate of the environment lies entirely in the hands of the developed countries is too narrow.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "e. Developing nations also contribute to environmental degradation through deforestation, overfishing and other unsustainable activities. Therefore, for the environment to be saved, it is necessary to collaborate with less developed nations, whom without their help, any effort put forth would be futile.  \n\nFurthermore, imbalances in power and resources make it difficult for developed nations to act in the interest of the environment and less developed countries. Many developed nations have vested interests in exploiting the natural resources of less developed nations, and this often leads them to prioritize their economic interests over environmental sustainability. As such, a more equitable distribution of resources and greater involvement of developing countries must be prioritized, partnering with them and providing expertise and support towards more sustainable activities. \n\nLastly, while developed nations may have the technologies to reduce carbon emissions, their economies operate in capitalist frames and often struggle to implement effective environmental policies that align with sustainable development. This struggle of balancing short-term profits with long-term sustainability has made it challenging for those in charge of decision-making processes to put forth environmentally sound policies. It is important for governments and corporations to recognize that there is no profit in a world that is incapable of sustaining life. Therefore developed nations must prioritize policies that align with environmental sustainability to ensure a prosperous future for upcoming generations.\n\nIn conclusion, while developed nations have a greater responsibility and resources to solve the environmental crisis, other nations' collaborative efforts cannot be overlooked in achieving environmentally sustainable policies and activities. The climate crisis is a global issue that requires elusive and inclusive cooperation for the planet to have a safe, protected, and sustainable future. The only way to keep the environment safe is through the collective effort of both developed and developing nations.

                "holders in mitigating global environmental issues should not be underestimated. Developing countries, for instance, can play a significant role by taking steps towards sustainable economic growth. Sustainable economic growth involves an approach to economic development that respects the limits of natural resources and their regenerative capacity. While developed countries need to take a leading role in finding ways to reduce carbon emissions and advocate conservation of natural resources, developing countries need to be proactive in finding ways to sustainably enhance their infrastructure and economies, provided that it does not cost the environment. For instance, Kenya has taken steps to promote renewable energy by deploying wind and solar power on a large scale. Its ambitious policy goal of issuing free solar panels to poor households has been a resounding success with more than 900,000 households adopting solar panels in a few years. Countries that may not have the funds for large infrastructure projects can still change the situation through implementing simpler schemes such as planting more trees in local neighborhoods. While this might seem trivial, each individual effort in each developing country adds up to make a significant impact on the environment.\nIn conclusion, the matter of environmental conservation is a complex, global issue that cannot be adequately addressed via a one-size-fits-all approach. While many argue that developed countries bear greater responsibility in promoting environmental conservation due to their historically larger carbon footprints and superior technological knowledge, it would be imprudent to rely solely on developed nations. All stakeholders have a part to play in combatting this critical issue that would impact the future for all. Governments have a responsibility to put in place regulations, incentivize businesses to become more eco-conscious and encourage sustainable development. Corporations must be held accountable for their actions and invest in cleaner technologies to reduce their carbon footprint. Developing nations must take steps to engage in sustainable practices with regards to economic growth while contributing to global environmental protection. Finally, individuals can make small changes in their daily lives that when added up, creates an immense positive impact on the environment. It is only through the collective effort of all the stakeholders that the natural world can be protected and sustained for future generations.",
                "holders cannot be ignored. Developing countries, for instance, are major contributors to global environmental issues. Many countries are in the process of industrializing, inevitably leading to increased emissions of greenhouse gases, which have been identified as one of the key causes of global warming. To mitigate this issue, developing nations can be encouraged to adopt cleaner forms of energy by providing technical and financial assistance when necessary. Developed countries can provide aid to encourage the adoption of renewable energy, such as solar and wind power, which do not rely on finite resources. Additionally, developed countries can facilitate the transfer of environmentally-friendly technology to developing countries, enabling them to access cost-effective technology and information on the most effective means to manage environmental issues.\nIt is also important for individuals to do their part in environmental conservation. While individuals feel that their actions are insignificant, small acts such as using public transport more often, reducing energy consumption, and utilizing recyclable and sustainable products can help to reduce the negative impact on the environment. Individual choices are important as they contribute to the collective movement of creating a greener planet. Collective efforts by individuals, irrespective of their nationality or economic status, would go a long way towards mitigating the negative impact of human activity on the environment.\nIn conclusion, the issue of environmental conservation is multifaceted and requires a concerted effort from all stakeholders to mitigate climate change and its effects on the natural world. Developed countries have a role to play in promoting environmental conservation, but other stakeholders, including businesses, developing countries and individuals, must also play their part. Ultimately, it is only through collective effort that we can effectively address the complex challenges affecting our planet.",
                "holders cannot be disregarded. Developing countries also have a role to play as they are often hit the hardest by environmental degradation. For these nations, poverty and the need to develop their economies often take precedence over environmental concerns. This is why programmes like the United Nations Development Programme Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are crucial in addressing both poverty alleviation and environmental protection. As part of the SDGs, climate action is one of the goals that seeks to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards. The sustainability of the natural environment must be integrated into the social and economic well-being of developing countries for long-term success. Even individual efforts, such as reducing plastic waste, eating less meat or using public transportation, can contribute to a more sustainable future. In reality, our collective efforts will be the key to making significant progress in environmental conservation.\nIn conclusion, while developed countries do have a vital role to play in environmental conservation, it is not a responsibility that lies solely on their shoulders. Other countries and stakeholders must also step up to the plate and take ownership of their actions. Governments should actively promote climate policies and incentivize the transition to a greener economy,while companies must embrace corporate social responsibility and take a proactive approach to environmental protection. Individuals must also play a role by adopting more sustainable lifestyles and pushing for change through advocacy and activism. Only through the concerted efforts of all stakeholders can we create a truly green world for generations to come.",
                "holders should not be neglected. Developing countries may not have the same resources or technology as their developed counterparts, but their efforts should not be disregarded - they can still make significant contributions towards environmental conservation. A prime example is Costa Rica, which has made remarkable strides in terms of environmental sustainability. The country is a pioneer in ecotourism, boasting 16 national parks, which have been the foundation of its economy for several decades. This is an excellent example of the kind of innovative thinking that can create win-win outcomes; it is possible to promote economic growth while protecting the environment. On the other hand, there are also concerns that some developing countries may not have sufficient resources or awareness to establish effective environmental policies. In such cases, international aid and cooperation may be necessary to spur implementation and enforce policies. Therefore, involvement and collaboration from developing countries and other stakeholders is vital to ensure a comprehensive approach towards environmental conservation.\n\nFurthermore, the issue of climate change and environmental degradation cannot be resolved by individual, localized efforts alone; it requires a collective, global response. Environmental restoration is indeed a global challenge that affects all nations, regardless of their level of development or geographical location. For example, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia, one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is rapidly dying due to climate change. The degradation is not just bad news to Australia but an environmental catastrophe that affects the world. Thus, it is crucial for all nations to unite and work towards a common goal of protecting and preserving our planet. This may entail formulating and implementing binding international treaties and agreements, developing new technologies, and promoting robust international cooperation and collaboration.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem reasonable for developed countries to take the lead in environmental conservation, a multidimensional and interrelated global problem such as environmental degradation requires the participation and contribution of all stakeholders, not solely the responsibility of developed countries. Governments, companies, and individuals from developing countries also have an essential role to play in protecting and preserving the natural world. As inhabitants of this planet, we must all be accountable for our actions and work collectively to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come.",
                "holders, particularly developing nations, cannot be overlooked. A significant number of developing nations are experiencing environmental degradation due to factors such as poverty and a lack of adequate regulations governing industrial activities. In this respect, developed countries must lend a helping hand to developing nations by providing the necessary financial assistance and technical expertise to promote sustainable environmental practices. For instance, the United Nations Green Climate Fund, established in 2010 to assist developing countries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, is financed by developed nations and has already helped many developing nations to plan and implement various projects, such as wind and solar energy power plants. While efforts by developed nations to provide support to developing nations can be hailed as being positive, it is not without its downsides. In some instances, support from developed nations is seen as an imposition or an agenda to influence the regulatory environment of developing nations. In order to mitigate this, there must be increased collaboration and a mutual understanding of the various stakeholders, which can be done through effective communication and consultation.\nUltimately, the issue of environmental conservation is a multidimensional one, and as such requires the effort of all stakeholders, regardless of their socioeconomic status. While developed nations may take the lead in terms of financial and technological capability, it is not sufficient to assume that this would resolve the issue of environmental degradation. It is important that all stakeholders, from government bodies to transnational corporations, consumers, and individuals, play a more active role in promoting environmental conservation through sustainable practices and responsible decision-making.",
                "holders are equally important to consider. Developing countries might lack the funds and technological expertise, but they still hold a significant responsibility in promoting environmental conservation. With a lack of stringent environmental laws, developing countries often become the dumping ground for hazardous waste or engaged in environmentally unsustainable production. However, as these countries' economies grow, they too will invariably emit more greenhouse gases and increasingly contribute to the environmental crisis. Developing countries could take the initiative to invest in green technologies and shifting towards renewable energy sources. For instance, China, a developing country, has taken the lead in developing renewable energy, investing heavily in wind and solar energy which has brought an incredibly recent rate at which coal was retired from their power grid. This type of initiative could undoubtedly reduce the environmental impact of developing countries, which are also quickly becoming major consumers, and speed up the timeline for halting climate change.\nCivil society also plays an essential role in the environmental conservation effort. Individuals' daily actions contribute to about 60% of carbon emissions; hence, environmental education is necessary. In many countries, civil society is advocating for sustainable living and pressing government to adopt more environmentally friendly policies. In the United States, activists launched the Green New Deal campaign, a comprehensive package of proposed policies to address climate change and economic inequality. In Australia, the Stop Adani campaign mobilizes community action against a proposed new coal mine, pressuring policymakers to reconsider their support for an environmentally unsustainable project. The collective action of civil society could influence positive action by governments and companies.\nIn conclusion, it is noteworthy that environmental conservation is a global issue that affects all of us, and everyone must recognize their share of the responsibility in mitigating the crisis. Developed countries could lend their support by sharing resources, but developing countries and civil society are also essential stakeholders whose efforts are equally critical. Each one of us has an essential role to play, and it is high time we took responsibility for our actions and work together to save our ailing planet.",
                "holders cannot be neglected. Developing nations, while not as prosperous, are often home to a significant portion of the world's remaining untouched natural resources. As such, their conservation of these resources takes on a much greater significance in the global environmental landscape. Developing countries should also be encouraged to pursue sustainable development. One possible solution to promote environmental conservation in developing countries could be through the provision of financial assistance and the transferring of environmental-friendly technologies. China, for instance, has accelerated the widespread adoption of solar panels in rural areas, effectively reducing carbon emissions while also promoting rural electrification. Similar measures by other developing countries would allow them to simultaneously achieve economic development and mitigate environmental degradation.\nNon-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individual citizens should also be involved in encouraging environmental responsibility. Individuals can contribute to a greener planet in many small yet significant ways, from conserving energy at home to modifying their consumer habits. For instance, buying locally-sourced products can help reduce carbon emissions from transportation. Eco-friendly transportation options, such as cycling or taking public transportation, can also help mitigate carbon emissions. NGOs, on the other hand, play an important role in promoting environmental awareness and lobbying for stronger environmental policies. Through grassroots movements and public activism, these organizations can promote sustainable living and push for institutional changes to foster greener policies.\nIn conclusion, environmental conservation is a challenge that requires concerted efforts from all stakeholders, irrespective of their socio-economic status. While developed countries possess greater means and technological expertise, businesses, NGOs, individual citizens and developing countries have an important role in creating a sustainable, green planet. By working together and sharing the responsibility of protecting the planet we call home, we can create a brighter future for generations to come.",
                "holders cannot be undermined. It is essential to recognize that environmental conservation should involve all nations, irrespective of their level of economic development. Developing countries, where environmental concerns often take a backseat to economic growth, have to be encouraged to prioritize the environment. For instance, Ethiopia, one of the poorest nations in the world, managed to plant 350 million trees in a single day, setting a new world record and exhibiting a collective effort towards environmental conservation. Similarly, Bhutan, despite its limited resources, has pledged to remain carbon neutral, preserving its biodiversity and natural environment. It is also important to acknowledge that there are other stakeholders, such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and individuals, who have made immense contributions towards environmental conservation. NGOs like Greenpeace and WWF have been instrumental in raising awareness and pushing governments and corporations to take action towards sustainability. Meanwhile, individuals worldwide have started to take small steps, like reducing plastic consumption and recycling, and are becoming increasingly conscious of the impact of their actions. This has culminated in a growing global movement towards environmental sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, while developed countries may have greater resources and financial means to promote environmental conservation, it is important to acknowledge that all nations and stakeholders have a role to play. Environmental conservation is a multifaceted global issue that requires collective and concerted efforts towards sustainability. Governments and corporations must actively take responsibility for their actions and adopt sustainable policies and practices. Developing nations must also prioritize environmental issues, and individuals must make small changes in their daily lives to promote sustainability. Only through a synergistic and collaborative approach can we hope to mitigate the environmental crisis and preserve the planet for future generations.",
                "holders cannot be understated. Developing countries, for instance, may not possess the same level of technological advancements and wealth as developed nations, but they do possess the natural resources that are vital to the conservation of our environment. Developing countries that possess high levels of biodiversity, such as Indonesia, Costa Rica and Madagascar, can conserve their natural habitats by prioritising ecotourism and the promotion of environmentally conscious local industries. This not only allows the countries to remain financially stable, but also ensures the longevity and sustainability of their natural heritage. Additionally, while the government of developed countries may be able to formulate environmental policies, it is the individual citizens of developed and developing countries that can truly make a change through their actions. Small actions such as conserving water, recycling and using sustainable products can contribute significantly to the environment. It is essential to understand that the effects of environmental degradation will affect all of us, regardless of our country's level of development.\n\nIn conclusion, while developed countries have a greater role to play in promoting environmental conservation due to their wealth and technological expertise, the responsibility should not fall solely on them. All stakeholders, including developing countries, businesses and individuals, have a role to play in mitigating environmental degradation. It is important that we work together and take collective responsibility to ensure that we leave a sustainable world for future generations.",
                "holders, including developing countries, non-governmental organizations and individual citizens must not be overlooked. Developing countries bear much of the burden brought on by climate changes that have been caused by developed nations. Addressing this multifaceted issue will require concerted efforts from both the developing and developed nations. Developing countries can prioritize reducing their carbon footprint and establishing laws and regulations to limit pollution. Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) can help raise awareness and instigate action to encourage individuals to adopt more environmentally sustainable lifestyles. There has been a growing trend of environmental activism, as more individuals come to the realization that the state of the environment is deteriorating rapidly. Millions of people across the globe have participated in events like Earth Hour, a global event that aims to encourage people to switch off their lights for one hour in a bid to cut down on energy consumption. These events help to raise awareness in communities about environmental conservation and sustainable living. Therefore, it is clear that all parties must play a role in addressing the environmental crisis, and not just developed nations.\nIn conclusion, while developed countries do possess the financial and technological capabilities to mitigate the impact of environmental degradation, it is not enough to rely solely on them and expect the issue to be resolved. Corporate social responsibility, individual actions, and efforts by developing countries and NGOs can all contribute significantly towards the goal of environmental sustainability. Only a collective effort by all stakeholders can bring about the significant changes needed to address this global issue."

International cooperation and coordination are also vital in addressing the climate crisis, and developed nations can play a critical role in this regard.\n\nDespite the opportunities, developed nations also face several challenges in tackling the environmental crisis. One challenge is the conflict between economic growth and environmental protection. Economic growth is a significant priority for most developed countries, and this often comes at the cost of environmental sustainability. Balancing environmental protection with economic growth is a delicate issue that requires careful consideration and planning. Another challenge is the reluctance of some developed nations to adopt environmentally-friendly policies, often due to vested interests. This reluctance slows down progress in environmental protection and hinders international cooperative efforts.\n\nIn conclusion, developed nations do bear a significant responsibility in protecting the environment due to the significant role they have played in its degradation. However, it is crucial to recognize that addressing the environmental crisis requires collective action and international cooperation.

A survey conducted by the child labour showed that 75% of the parents in Bangaladesh are unwilling to send their children to school because school expenses are a heavy burden. If the masses are unable to access education due to poverty and destitution, children will continue to be deprived of education, rendering it ineffective in solving problems.\nIn addition, there are certain problems which education would be unable to resolve alone. Although environmentalist movements like the Youth for Climate movement have been gaining traction in recent years, the United Nations noted that in 2018, carbon dioxide emissions were on the rise for the first time in four years. A report released by the United Nations Environment Programme indicates that a tipping point has already been reached in the Artic and Greenland, where permafrost has started melting more than 70 years before it was expected to. Even as Canada announces a \"climate emergency\", its political leaders approved of a new pipeline deal for natural gas. This is because of the sheer complexity of problems like climate change and environmental degradation; most of the time, the education of consumers alone is inadequate and ineffective in halting environmental destruction that has been ongoing for decades. In such cases, strong political will and corporate-sector leadership will be more effective. Siemens, the world'slargest manufacturer, has devoted more than 100 million euros to reducing its carbon emissions by half by 2030. Morocco, for instance, has introduced \u2013 and is set to meet \u2013 ambitious goals, such as targeting to have 42% of installed electricity production capacity from renewable energy by 2020. These examples illustrate the fact that political will and leadership would be more effective in mitigating climate change, especially because domestic energy consumption forms a remarkably negligible percentage of carbon emissions. Some of the problems which we face require a multidimensional and a multi-pronged approach, in which education can only form one pillar.\nFinally, education has its own inherent limitations, which may render it ineffective and even counterproductive in solving social problems. On the surface, it may seem that education is a social leveller that empowers individuals and improves lives. This, however, does not seem to hold true in increasingly stratified developed countries, where the presence of generational wealth is a critical determinant of academic success. In Singapore, which claims to uphold meritocracy, children from more affluent family backgrounds grossly outperform those who come from humbler backgrounds, primarily because affluent parents pass on advantages such as better learning resources and additional help like enrichment classes to their offspring. A research study conducted in 2016 found that nearly 41% of students in schools which offer the prestigious Integrated Programme were from families with a monthly household income of at least $10,000. Conversely, only 7% had similar backgrounds in government schools which did not offer the programme.  Students in the Integrated Programme enjoy opportunities and resources which their peers in government schools do not have access to, such as leadership programmes and education and career guidance mentorship. Given that the education system ultimately feeds into the job market, particularly in Singapore, the differences in access to educational opportunities since young inevitably result in severely hampered social mobility.\nIn summary, education can act as a catalyst to solve problems like poverty and discrimination. However, education is not the panacea to all the problems of the modern world because of the fact that there are people who cannot afford education; because of the multi-dimensional and multi-faceted nature of today'schallenges; and the inherent limitations unique to education. Ultimately, education can make the hopeless image of our future more vibrant and colourful, but that image will still be left incomplete if other aspects of society do not reform and complement education.",

Inequalities exist in access to education, health services, and economic opportunities. These inequalities are often entrenched in societal structures, making them resistant to change. It is necessary to address the root causes of inequality, such as structural discrimination and societal biases, to address this problem fully.\n\nEducation is also unlikely to solve environmental problems such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution. These issues are global and require a collective effort from governments, corporations, and individuals to solve them. Education can, however, play a crucial role in increasing awareness of environmental issues and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nFurther, education cannot solve all problems such as conflict and war. In many cases, conflicts arise from deeply rooted historical, cultural, and political differences that cannot be addressed through education alone. It requires political will, diplomacy, and dialogue to resolve these conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, while education is crucial for human development, it is unlikely to solve all the world's problems. Some problems, such as poverty, inequality and discrimination, are deeply entrenched in societal structures and require a multifaceted approach to address them. Education can play a vital role in providing individuals with opportunities, raising awareness, and promoting positive values, but it cannot solve complex global issues alone.

Another obstacle is that education, as a tool for social change, cannot stand alone and solve all issues. It must be coupled with social, economic, and political policies that work to fix the many systemic issues that education alone cannot undo.\nMoreover, education, in spite of its contributions, is not a fool-proof system. For instance, the insistence on formalised teaching can be counterproductive, especially for those who do not fit within the current education paradigms. Individuals who do not conform to the mainstream idea of intelligence may fail to excel academically and may find themselves left behind in the education system, and in society as a whole. Additionally, education may not always solve the problem at hand. As an example, research demonstrates that education does not always succeed in providing individuals with the skills and knowledge needed for them to earn a living, and sometimes fails to prepare individuals to handle job loss, automation, and other challenges resulting from changes in the economy. Finally, as some critics point out, education is irrespective of the vast and complex interactions of historical, social, and political forces at play in many situations; therefore, a single-minded focus on education alone is not always adequate.\nIn conclusion, as much as education is an essential tool for individual empowerment, uplifting communities, and solving many issues within societies, it cannot be seen as a cure-all solution. Education alone cannot fix all problems, and it is imperative to remember that education must be coupled with other social, political, and economic policies to achieve long-term social transformation.

Additionally, education may not be accessible to all in conflict zones, war-torn countries, and areas plagued by natural disasters. Therefore, the effectiveness of education in solving problems is limited by the very availability, accessibility, and affordability of education itself.\nMoreover, education is not an end in itself. Modern-day societies face issues that simply cannot be solved with education alone. In a shifting job market, it is important to be flexible and adaptable, and to possess more than academic skillsets. Other skills, such as communication, emotional intelligence, and the ability to problem-solve and collaborate are increasingly in demand. Society requires individuals who can step up as leaders and effect change, rather than solely as repositories of knowledge. In short, education alone cannot be the solution to modern-day challenges.\nIn conclusion, while education is essential and has the power to solve some social problems, it is just one part of the solution. To tackle the challenges of modern society effectively, education must be combined with other strategies such as economic policies, political reforms, and social initiatives. Education is an essential tool, but it cannot solve all the problems on its own. Rather, it must be part of a more comprehensive approach towards achieving the societies we truly aspire towards.",

To address such structural issues requires a top-down approach involving policymakers and the international community. While education is undoubtedly an indispensable tool, it is insufficient to solve all the problems that we face today.\nIn conclusion, education has indeed been a force for good, and has enabled individuals and communities to overcome problems such as poverty and discrimination. Yet, education cannot single-handedly solve issues which are deeply entrenched in our society. Instead, it must be part of a broader approach that addresses systemic issues, and must interface with both top-down and bottom-up approaches.

Another limitation to education is that while it may provide an individual with the knowledge and skills to earn a living, it does not guarantee them a job or a sustainable income. Many regions around the world have plagued by high youth unemployment, including both developed and undeveloped countries. Thus, the promise of equal opportunities via education can sometimes fail in the face of concrete economic realities. Furthermore, education may promote a singular, homogenous view of the world, instead of celebrating the variety that exists in terms of culture, language, and societal norms. This could result in the marginalization of certain communities that do not fall under established societal norms or expectations, perpetuating oppressive systems and mindsets. This is why education cannot be seen as the answer to all problems- it is only one tool in the box which must be used wisely and in combination with other possibilities.\n\n\nIn conclusion, it is tempting to view education as a cure-all to the ills of society since it has unequivocal benefits and is undoubtedly an important tool for positive change. It empowers individuals, opens doors to opportunities, and helps solve problems of inequality and poverty. However, these benefits must be weighed against the challenges and limitations that education presents.

            "human_gen_truncate": "s is a clear sign of regression as it infringes on people'srights to protect their personal life, making them vulnerable in the process.\nYet, despite claims that science and its developments should be curtailed as they pose a risk to the human race, proponents of science would agree that restrictions and guidelines have been placed upon these advancements to ensure the safe use and development of scientific technologies. The fact that societies around the world have chosen regulation over blunt instruments like partial or complete bans implicitly suggest that humanity has benefitted from scientific developments. Science has always helped to expand the combined human pool of knowledge, allowing man to gain insights into the secrets of nature, and enabling him to manipulate this for the greater good of mankind. Science has been instrumental in debunking claims: for instance, the belief that interference with a dead body was an offence to the gods held us back from understanding the human anatomy until the 13thcentury. Andreas Vasalies was able to provide detailed drawings of the human anatomy in the 16thcentury, which ultimately proved invaluable to the development of the branch of medicine now known as surgery. The development of the microscope by Anton Van Leeuwenhonk debunked superstitions that diseases rampant in India, China and Europe were caused by \"miasma\", a passing vapor filled with particles from decomposed matter. These examples evinced the claim that scientific advancements have clarified decades of misconceptions which were hindering the progress of human civilisations.\nAt the same time, social and economic ills that had once blighted mankind'spursuit of progress have now been surmounted by technology. While people in developed economies tend to have access to shelter and education, the same cannot be said of their counterparts living in developing countries. The emergence of technology like genetically modified crops and information technology have revolutionized the way people can escape the straitjacket of poverty and improve their lives. The concept of Green Revolution has taken the world by storm as it was able to increase and enhance the quality of food, establishing food security in many impoverished societies. These series of research, development and technology transfer initiatives were regarded as a panacea to the Malthusian conundrum that the world was facing where the world population was projected to outgrow the food supply, possibly leading to mass starvation. The Green Revolution, which involved high yielding varieties (HYVs) and genetically modified crops, resulted in an exponential increase in global cereal production by 280% and in global consumption per capita by 25% between 1961 and 2004. Besides addressing hunger, the Green Revolution addressed other aspects of food security, such as nutritional inadequacy, with genetically modified crops. Golden Rice, touted to be a genetic marvel, was efficient in meeting the dietary requirements of those afflicted with Vitamin A deficiency. In societies where widespread famine has struck and there seemed to be no hope for improvement, the Green Revolution was an enormous breakthrough for poverty reduction efforts and indeed shines as a success story. Amidst mounting worldwide social and economic tensions, the history of scientific advancement only serves to reaffirm the idea that science is the panacea to a wide host of social problems.\nIn addition to fulfilling mankind'sbasic and physical needs, technologies have revitalized the medical arena and have improved the quality of life. In recent times, many tools and procedures have been invented with the objective of prolonging human life. Devices such as the artificial pacemaker have been invented to prolong the life of individuals suffering from once debilitating health conditions like Bradycardia. More recently, the National Heart Centre Singapore has proposed that scans of patients\" hearts could be turned into 3D models. This has long-standing benefits as it helps cardiac surgeons make better surgery plans, especially for non-invasive procedures, and can also be used as a training tool for young doctors. Most importantly, the arrival of such technology would make animal testing obsolete; finally, human health need not be predicated on the suffering of animals, which is a step forward for mankind.People may also pin their hopes on pharmacogenomic research and the concept of personalized medicine, which is administered with the understanding that individuals may have different responses to drugs due to different genes. Medco Health Solutions, one of America'slargest pharmacy benefit managers until it was acquired by Express Solutions in 2011, was leading the way in making the provision of personal genomics services to the masses a reality. It had already achieved successes with personalized treatment of Warfarin, a widely used blood thinner to prevent clots, and Tamoxifen for breast cancer. Essentially, matching the right drugs to the patients has obvious clinical benefits, but also makes good economic sense. By reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis, long hospitalization periods and the need for follow-up treatment, personalized healthcare can generate significant cost savings. All of these will ultimately allow patients to direct their own care to some extent, empowering them with a greater sense of freedom and self-reliance, truly heralding a breakthrough in medical science. Advances in personalised medicine would also allow for the treatment of rare disorders and allow the industry to track the development of diseases. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the National Healthcare System is collaborating with academia and industry to analyse the genetic material of persons with rare disorders through the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is hoped that such information will shed light on and save lives from disorders which were previously unknown. Contrary to popular belief that scientific discovery would cause humanity to regress, the history of medical science is a testament to the fact that scientific advancements can bolster the development of the human race.\nIn summary, science has apparently revolutionised the way we live today, by mechanisation, automation and by altering the way we think. While there are instances, though few and far between, where scientific technologies seem to threaten our very humanity, it must be recognized that those do not necessarily mean science only pulls society backwards. The numerous checks and balances in place today serve to assure us that we can trust science to influence us positively as it always has, as we continue to revel in its wonders.",

Even more remarkable, AI has aids in the diagnosis of diseases that were previously undetectable by human doctors, making healthcare more precise and accessible. It has also improved education by making personalized learning, simulations, and collaborations easier.\n\nMoreover, science has played a considerable role in enhancing the quality of life for people worldwide. Advancements in medicine have led to the creation of life-saving vaccines, treatments and surgical procedures that enable people to live longer, healthier lives. Agricultural advances have helped alleviate world hunger by improving crop yields and created genetically engineered foods that are more resistant to pests, severe weather, and disease-causing organisms. Energy production has also improved with the creation of renewable energy that reduces the carbon footprint on earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement that as science advances, the human race regresses is an oversimplification of the situation. Although it is true that technology is rapidly improving and changing the way we live, there is no direct correlation between scientific advancements and human regression. Instead, the progress made by science is beneficial to all aspects of our lives.

Social media allows people to make new friends from different nationalities, as well as sustain relationships with friends and family who have moved overseas. For example, through sites like Tumblr blogs, friendships can be forged between someone living in Asia and another living in Canada. These allow for a deeper understanding of other cultures, practices and ways of thinking that we may not otherwise be exposed to. With this greater comprehension comes more tolerance, and therefore greater unity on a global level. Additionally, social networking applications such as Skype and Facebook allow video calls to be made, which are helpful in maintaining that human touch. Social media has shrunk the world into one that can be accessed from the small screen of a smartphone, reducing the distance between people.\nNext, social media allows individuals from all walks of life to air their views, and facilitates discourse between individuals with distinct, unique perspectives. Since close to 1.7 billion people of the 7.2 billion people in the world today have active social media accounts, there is a smorgasbord of differing opinions online. Social media platforms empower these individuals to broadcast their views, and thus provides one with a unique insight into the views of others. Take for example, Singapore'spolitical scene. Cognizant of the increasing online presence of Singaporeans, the government created a website called eGov2015 in a bid to ensure that feedback from Singaporeans from all walks of life can be heard, and to facilitate greater co-creation and collaboration between the government and the people. Social media therefore makes it easier for individuals and organizations alike to hear different views and thus act accordingly.\nFinally, social media also helps to unite the global community by shedding light on situations all around the world. With the ease of dissemination of information, netizens all around the world are not just able to glean insights into the struggles of others but are empowered to take action. For example, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, started in the summer of 2014, raised $11.5 million for its cause. Over 17 million people uploaded their challenge videos to Facebook, and thus cause was also championed by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. The challenge was started in a bid to raise awareness for the disease known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the use of social media spreading this challenge resulted in its resounding success. A more recent example would be the Trashtag Challenge, where social media users pick up litter, clean their environment and later post a photo of their accomplishments on social media. It has allowed users a better insight of the sheer scale of the plastics pollution problem. It is a good example of how social media can go further than raising awareness to mobilizing individuals to act, producing tangible results. In this way, social media allows for the creation of unity among people, for it raises awareness about issues that society is confronted with and mobilizes people to act in the interest of their communities.\nIn essence, while social media may cause rifts to occur and widen within society, its tendency to unite and bring people together is even greater. The availability of information online allows for the forging of a more understanding and hence, more united world and is something that would have been unattainable in a world fragmented into isolated groups.",

Social media has also opened up new channels for communication and connection, allowing people from different cultures and backgrounds to connect and share experiences. Furthermore, social media has created new opportunities for creativity, expression, and entrepreneurship, giving people a platform to develop their talents and share their work with the world.\n\nMoreover, social media has been a helpful tool during the COVID-19 pandemic. With many people isolated from their families and friends, social media has provided a way for people to stay connected and support each other. Social media has also been used to share information about the virus and its effects, as well as to organize volunteers and support groups for those in need. This has demonstrated how social media can be a force for unity in times of crisis.\n\nIn conclusion, the claim that social media divides more than it unites is both true and false, depending on the context. Social media can be divisive when it reinforces echo chambers, spreads disinformation, fuels cyberbullying and hate speech, or promotes segregation and prejudice. However, social media can also be a unifying force when it connects people, promotes social causes, expands opportunities for creativity, and supports communities in times of crisis.

Social media has also created a virtual community for people who may feel isolated or marginalized in society, such as the LGBTQ+ community who can find support networks and allies through online platforms. Hence, social media can create a sense of community and foster unity amongst individuals who may otherwise feel disconnected.\nMoreover, social media has made it easier for individuals to share differing opinions and views on a wide range of subjects.

It is clear that it is through social media that we can have a loud voice and can make our opinions heard. It is not just about bringing people together, but social media has made it possible for people to collaborate with each other in ways they never could before. Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter have allowed grand ideas to be realised due to the collective power of small donations from all over the world. Besides, social media platforms are often used as tools for raising funds for fundraising events or disasters.\nFurthermore, social media opens up opportunities for intercultural dialogue and understanding, creating a platform where people can connect with individuals from different ethnicities and religious backgrounds, breaking down stereotypes and promoting diversity.

The use of social media in this instance allowed the world to keep up with the events happening in those countries in real-time, and even resulted in the overthrow of several oppressive regimes. It also led to greater accountability, forcing governments to take note of the citizens' voices.

Social media also enables people to connect over issues that they care about, regardless of geographic location. Advocacy groups can use social media to raise awareness about various issues, such as climate change and human rights abuses, which by extension can prompt users to take action. The reach and speed of this awareness in turn gathers a sense of momentum amongst people, leading to a force of change. The viral \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" which dominated social media walls for a while in 2014 is a notable example of the extent of social media's ability to unite people for a common cause. The campaign raised awareness and funds for Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), allowing people from all over the world to unite for the cause. Therefore, it is not true to say that social media divides more than it unites as it is a powerful tool that enables individuals to come together and create a sense of shared experience.\nFurthermore, social media creates a platform for individuals to share their thoughts and opinions, and provides opportunities for diverse groups to be heard. Social media serves as a megaphone for minorities who may not have otherwise had a voice in mainstream communities. Social media affords these groups the opportunity to network with like-minded individuals and build communities that can challenge the existing power structures and fight for change. In Singapore, for example, there has been a rise in social media usage to voice opinions and critiques on government policies. While old-school methods like traditional media outlets also played a role, social media served to amplify citizen voices. This shows how social media affords diverse perspectives a voice, allowing for a range of opinions and points of view that enrich our collective discourse.\nIn conclusion, while social media has the potential to divide individuals along generational or ideological divides and perpetuate echo chambers, its ability to unite individuals and communities should not be overlooked. Social media serves as a global platform for communication and facilitates sharing of diverse views.

The event too was organised and promoted primary via social media.\nMoreover, social media can bring about positive social change by giving a voice to marginalised groups who otherwise have little opportunity or resources to have their voices heard. For instance, social media played a critical role in spreading awareness and getting signatures for the anti-bullying petition started by teenager Katie Davis, which eventually garnered more than 34,000 supporters. This spurred the UK government to include anti-bullying strategies in schools. Another example would be climate activists: Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg, began her environmental campaigning through Instagram and Twitter, before being invited to speak at the United Nations.\nIn conclusion, social media has the power to divide or unite depending on the perspective and use. While it does aggravate the generational divide and perpetuate filter bubbles, it enable positive change by uniting people who share similar goals and aspirations and giving a voice to marginalised groups.

This often is a direct translation of the amount of effort a child puts into his studies, and so, even a child from a disadvantaged background can get into university with government or corporate scholarships. This therefore aids in creating income mobility within the population, preventing the creation of a single educated group, and hence, social segregation and exclusivity.\nHowever, while education may be a means with which one can get out of the poverty cycle, it can also work in the opposite direction \u2013 by widening the income gap between the rich and the poor in Singapore. Richer families are easily able to afford tuition, which sets those children from those families up on a more advantageous position. The help rendered to them by their tutors make it easier for them to excel in their studies as compared to the children from poorer families that cannot afford tuition, hence widening the education disparity between the rich and the poor in Singapore. Increasingly, Singaporeans have lost faith in the education system as a leveller, as a representation of social mobility, with many criticising the fact that students in elite schools tend to hail from affluent family backgrounds, and the increased importance of social capital in Singapore.  Given the fact that the education system has traditionally fed into the labour market, there are concerns that the education system only serves to perpetuate the cycle of inequality.\nLastly, it is possible to have a fair and inclusive society in Singapore through the appeal to the individual. From the age of seven, Singaporean students are made to recite the Pledge in school on a daily basis, subconsciously reminding themselves that differences in race, language, and religion does not make one more, or indeed less, of a Singaporean than anyone else. Singaporeans are taught from when they were young that everyone is equal, and this is hopefully reflected in their dealings with others in the later part of their lives. The creation of a society that welcomes all, despite their differences, can only be done through cooperation of individuals.\nThat said, however, it is ultimately up to individuals to practise being inclusive and non-discriminatory. While Singapore claims to have achieved a \"harmonious and inclusive\" society, in reality, racial and religious tensions simmer beneath the surface; according to a YouGov survey, 23% of Singaporeans have experienced discrimination while renting properties. Minorities seem to be disproportionately affected, with 49% of Indians surveyed and 34% of Malays reporting such experiences. More than 80% of minorities also report the occurrence of \"microaggressions\" in their daily lives, suggesting that even a society like Singapore which tries its best to be inclusive has a long way to go. Notwithstanding this, as long as individuals actively strive to correct their biases, the culture of fairness and inclusivity will hopefully grow stronger.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed possible to have a highly fair and inclusive society in Singapore, through the implementation of government policies, education, and outreach on an individual level, especially since the framework and guiding policies that have been set down by the leaders of Singapore highlights the importance of those two qualities.",

Singapore's education system is one of the best in the world and is designed to provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds. This has helped to level the playing field and ensure that everyone has an equal chance of success. \n\nAnother way in which Singapore is building a fair and inclusive society is by investing in social safety nets. For example, the government has implemented social welfare programs that provide financial assistance to those in need, such as the ComCare scheme. This helps to ensure that people are not excluded from society due to poverty and enables them to live with dignity. \n\nThe government has also taken steps to promote social cohesion and integration across different ethnic and racial groups. For example, the National Integration Council has been established to promote racial and religious harmony in society. Singapore's multi-ethnic representation in parliament also helps to ensure that the different voices of society are heard and that policies are designed to benefit everyone. \n\nIn conclusion, building a fair and inclusive society is not an easy task. Singapore faces significant challenges that must be overcome if the country is to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, many steps have already been taken to promote social justice, including investing in education, establishing social safety nets, and promoting social cohesion.

By doing so, Singapore's educational system instils in its students the importance of embracing different cultures and viewpoints, which helps to create a tolerant and inclusive society.\n\nNevertheless, there are still some shortcomings to Singapore's efforts towards creating a truly fair and inclusive society. The accusations of micro-aggressions and institutionalised bias towards certain groups in Singapore highlight that there is still work to be done in ensuring that all individuals are treated fairly and with respect. Some groups, such as those with disabilities, may still face greater challenges when it comes to accessing education and employment opportunities, and may require more targeted policies to ensure they are not left behind. Additionally, the lack of representativeness in some sectors, such as politics or media, shows that Singapore still has some progress to make when it comes to creating a more inclusive society.

For instance, the concept of meritocracy has been criticised for perpetuating inequality, as children from affluent families who can afford private tuition services often have an edge over their less advantaged peers.

By continuing to promote equality of opportunity, celebrate diversity, and provide quality education, Singapore can maintain its position as a meritocratic and pluralistic nation.

The allegations of micro-aggressions and the prevalence of implicit biases show that it is important to continue the conversation on what an inclusive society really means. We must not only aim to tolerate diversity but also strive for genuine acceptance and celebrate the differences in our society instead of merely preaching tolerance. There is also a need for greater representation of minority groups in leadership positions, both in the public and private sector. The role of the media and societal attitudes towards certain groups also need to be challenged and adjusted to ensure that everybody is treated fairly and inclusively.\nTo conclude, while having a completely fair and inclusive society may be impossible, Singapore has already achieved a great deal in creating a society that is largely tolerant, accepting and diverse.

One of the biggest obstacles is the prevalence of micro-aggressions, which have been reported by members of minority groups in Singapore. These micro-aggressions, such as racial slurs or being treated differently by security personnel, serve to reinforce the idea that certain groups are inferior, and are not deserving of equality. Such micro-aggressions are a symptom of a deeper societal issue \u2013 the fact that Singaporean society is still grappling with the idea of acceptance and true inclusivity. Additionally, economic inequality in Singapore remains an issue, with some individuals still being locked in intergenerational poverty or simply lacking the social capital necessary for social mobility.\nIn conclusion, a fair and inclusive society in Singapore can be achieved through government policies and the availability of affordable quality education. However, micro-aggressions and economic inequality remain obstacles that Singapore needs to overcome in order to truly be a society that is fair and inclusive for all.

This reinforces the idea that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed through effort, and lessens the effect of historical inequalities that have persisted in society. Education in Singapore thus plays a crucial role in promoting fairness and inclusivity, and will continue to do so if it stays relevant and quality education remains accessible to all.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the achievement of a fair and inclusive society cannot be entirely reliant on the policies and actions of the government. The mindset of the people is crucial in ensuring a fair and inclusive society, as it is the individuals who make up the social fabric. For example, despite the existence of non-discriminatory policies, micro-aggressions have been reported excessively, with the use of racial slurs and discriminatory language. This suggests that there are individuals who prioritize their own interests over others, and lack basic empathy and understanding of diversity. To achieve a fair and inclusive society, citizens must actively participate in promoting the idea of equality and inclusivity, and challenge discriminatory practices. This includes taking responsibility for their own actions and recognizing their own biases. In short, fairness and inclusivity cannot be imposed upon society, but must be accepted and supported by its members.\n\nIn conclusion, a fair and inclusive society in Singapore is possible, but not without continuous effort from the government, individuals and society.

The incident has prompted consumer watchdog CASE to relook measures and step up efforts in eradicating malpractices by errant shop owners. Another individual started a crowd-funding campaign separately to raise money to help the foreign worker and was successful in gathering widespread support for the worker. This incident highlights how Singaporeans can and have been making positive changes in our society through simple acts and efforts that have snowballed to raise awareness and generate discussion and change.\nAdditionally, individuals can also make positive changes in society through social activism to help vulnerable communities and make Singapore a kinder and more compassionate society. The Ground Up Initiative, for instance, was started by Tay Lai Hock in 2002, and seeks to promote the \"kampung spirit\" of neighbourliness in tandem with sustainable living. It is admittedly breaking ground and entering the consciousness of educators and students in Singapore, even as the country seems to relentlessly hurtle away from its past, into the future. Through social activism, a single individual can engender positive change in society by impacting the lives of others through small but genuine efforts. Another example is that of The Hidden Good, a movement started by two youths several years back which has also drawn much attention for its attempts to enact change. Through its series of social experiments and online podcasts, the Hidden Good aims to highlight the inherent and latent kindness in each and every Singaporean and make Singapore a more compassionate society. Through these various efforts, many individuals have in their own ways started a spark to fuel. While individual efforts may seem insignificant in a seemingly idealistic cause, it is all these ground-up efforts that have successfully reached out to the disenfranchised and underprivileged who may have been left behind.\nHowever, skeptics may argue that it is highly improbable for an individual alone to make a significant impact in our society, given how risk-averse and conservative we are. They purport that individuals cannot make a significant positive impact on society as the status quo is simply stacked too highly against them and that the authorities hold too much sway over the civil sphere. Some may point to the \"Save My CPF\" campaign, for which blogger Roy Ngerng was sued for defamation for voicing his opposition an unhappiness about the national savings scheme, citing how the bureaucracy and political system are still resistant to change and alternative voices system are still disregarded. In a climate where the government remains conservative and powerful, and the system is entrenched in tradition, the individual seems powerless to be able to do much to change society. Yet, as Singapore moves into a more mature and developed society, this belief is increasingly outdated. While it is true that the government is still conservative and maintains strict control over many issues, there are now many more opportunities for an individual to bring about change, through discourse and activism. As Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said in recent times, the government will move towards a more collaborative, co-creative leadership model under the fourth generation of leadership. Even if we have some way to go before we can become a truly open country that is receptive to change, the truth is that individuals today can already make a change in society in small but effective ways.\nAn individual alone has the power to bring about positive change in society by setting in motion a domino effect that will eventually have far-reaching impact. Through political and social activism, we see how many Singaporeans have come forward to do their part for society by triggering greater awareness and discussion or simply by touching the lives of those they help. As Singapore moves into the future, it is important for Singaporeans to be more participative and engaged in bringing about change in society. Even if an individual effort seems insignificant in the larger scheme of things, it is many of those tiny but important efforts that will move Singapore society into a more developed, civilised, mature and kind one.",

Social media platforms have led to the implementation of petitions, fundraisers, and other donation drives, which have successfully raised awareness and funds for people in need.\n\nWhile it is evident that individuals can bring about change, all these examples required persistent effort, dedication, and the determination to bring about change. Change requires a long-term commitment and an unwavering belief in one's beliefs and values.\n\nHowever, some may argue that it's impossible for an individual to bring change in society without the help of others. It's true that change can only be brought about when people come together. However, that does not dismiss the fact that it takes one person to influence and persuade others to create a movement. For instance, in Malaysia, Bersih 2.0 began as a group of individuals protesting for clean and fair elections. The movement drew attention from Malaysians that joined in the effort, and the movement eventually resulted in the Malaysian government's election reform process. The point being, Bersih 2.0 began solely with a group of individuals, and through their persistence, they created a movement that brought about positive change in society.\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that while change is brought about by a group of individuals working together, it takes one person to take the first step and start the journey. It takes one person to make a difference, influence others, and inspire change. It takes courage, persistence, vision, and unwavering determination to bring about change.\n\nIn conclusion, one person can make a positive difference in society and can inspire others to create a movement for the common good. It requires a strong belief in one's values and an unwavering commitment to bringing about change, and by doing so, one person can change the course of history. Hence, collective effort is essential in driving positive change, but the journey always begins with a single individual.",

The incident resulted in a public campaign to expose shady retailers and to encourage consumers to be more vigilant.

These campaigns and movements demonstrate how individuals can bring about social change by raising awareness and advocating their causes, and through social media, their message can reach wider audiences and be amplified many times over.\n\nIn conclusion, individuals have the power to make a positive change in society by participating in political discourse and discussion, and by raising awareness of social issues. We live in an era where social media platforms have amplified the voices of individuals to make themselves heard. Therefore, it is important for individuals to participate more actively in shaping our society, and to be the change they wish to see in the world.

While the traditional top-down approach of discourse is maintained, technology and social media have now given individuals a collective platform to voice their concerns and interests. In other cases, individuals can also serve as catalysts to shed light on various social issues, and encourage discussions on how to tackle them.

This incident has sparked a conversation about ethical business practices and the need for greater protection for foreign workers in Singapore. Through the sharing of information and raising awareness of issues that affect the community, individuals can effect change not only in their local community but also on a national level.\n\nIn conclusion, Margaret Mead's quote is a powerful reminder that individuals can make a positive change in society, no matter how small or insignificant they feel.

While it may not be easy, the potential for change is always present, and each individual has a role to play in shaping Singapore's future.",

This is an example of how one person's act of courage and speaking up against injustice can bring about positive change and create a ripple effect, leading to action being taken. In both of these instances, individuals had the ability to start a conversation around important issues and effect positive social change.\nIn conclusion, individuals can make a positive change in society by initiating political conversations and driving discourse on different issues through social media, and amplifying their voices to the authorities.

These examples demonstrate how individuals can make a positive change in society through raising awareness, highlighting issues and gathering support to push for change.\n\nEconomic change can also be initiated by individuals, many of whom are entrepreneurs and innovators that have made significant contributions to Singapore's economy. They have channeled resources, be it technology or labour, towards filling a gap or solving a problem, in the process creating new opportunities for growth and expansion. One such entrepreneur is Tan Min Liang, the founder of Razer, a global lifestyle brand for gamers. What started as a small operation in 2005 quickly expanded due to Tan's vision of tapping into Singapore's rich pool of tech talent, leading to the creation of products that were successful in the fast-growing esports industry. Razer is now a publicly-listed company worth over US$1 billion and employs more than 1,600 individuals worldwide. Tan is just one of many entrepreneurs and innovators that have made an economic impact that goes beyond their individual efforts, empowering people in Singapore through job creation, building tangible capabilities in tech and growing a sector that Singapore looks to as a critical player in its economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the responsibility and ability to make a positive impact in Singaporean society have increasingly shifted from the government to its citizens, as evidenced by the different ways individuals have been able to initiate positive change in political, social and economic spheres. Through political discourse, raising awareness of social issues and economic innovation, individuals have demonstrated that they are catalysts of change in Singapore.

            "prompt": "HOW FAR IS IT FAIR TO CONSIDER THE ELDERLY TO BE A BURDEN ON SOCIETY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "rited notwithstanding, it is arguably true that the elderly are viewed as increasingly obsolete in the economy of tomorrow.\nYet, while the aforementioned challenges may seem overwhelming, it is essential to recognize that the elderly are not inevitably doomed to be a burden to society. Amidst an increasing elderly population in many countries, it has become ever more urgent and important for countries to tap on the pool of elderly as a demographic group which can bring about greater opportunities and benefits. The elderly need not be a burden to society if sound government policies are devised and implemented to encourage the elderly to become economically productive. The elderly, while less mobile and efficient, still represent a large pool of people who can contribute to the economy. Governments can introduce policies to encourage elderly participation in the workforce by providing monetary incentives, as well as retraining and skills upgrading opportunities. For instance, Singapore has the Workfare Income Supplement scheme, which gives older workers higher take-home pay and increased Central Provident Fund contributions. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices also uses advertisements and schemes to encourage employment of older workers by changing socio-cultural perceptions of the elderly. By encouraging the elderly to become financially independent, less pressure is placed on governments and families to provide support for the elderly. In fact, the elderly can help to supplement the dwindling workforce in many countries by filling in labour gaps such as in the services industry. From the aforementioned, one can evidently see that the elderly can provide many benefits to society if sound governmental policies are put in place to encourage the elderly to become more independent.\nAnother key aspect of governmental policies which can help alleviate the burden that the elderly put on society is in terms of promoting healthy ageing and encouraging healthier lifestyles. With a healthier elderly population, less will be spent on healthcare costs as there will be fewer illnesses and medical issues in society. Campaigns to encourage healthy dietary practices and regular exercise are useful in shaping a healthy population. Technology, the very tool which has led to the decreased relevance of elderly, should in fact be utilized to help the elderly lead healthier lives. For instance, a group of National Technological University students have devised electronic games that require physical participation from the elderly. These games are already being tested at senior activity centres around the island, and suggest that there is huge potential to encourage the elderly to lead healthier lifestyles. Indeed, if the elderly can be healthy and fit, they will be able to contribute to society much more, rather than be a liability to society. As such, it is certainly not inevitable that the elderly are a burden.\nMoreover, the elderly population need not be a burden to society as they can stimulate certain sectors in a country'seconomy. The elderly population brings with it a diverse range of needs that has given rise to the \"silver industry\". This represents a significant growth sector for economies as businesses can tap on growing demand for geriatric services, medicinal and pharmaceutical services as well as infrastructure and facilities that cater to the needs of the elderly. For instance, in the UK, many households have stair lifts which can help transport older family members up and down flights of stairs. In Japan, buses have been equipped with mobile ramps that cater to elderly on wheelchairs. Singapore has also recently been ranked third out of fifteen Asian-Pacific countries in terms of silver industry market potential, which refers to the potential of a market emerging to serve the unique needs of affluent but aging consumers. All these opportunities represent the many benefits that the elderly can bring to the economy by introducing greater demand for geriatric goods and services. This potential growth sector can lead to economic growth for the society. Clearly, the elderly can also bring about benefits and opportunities, and need not be a burden to society.\nIn conclusion, it is not inevitable for the elderly to be a burden to society. While the elderly can be a burden in certain aspects, sound government policies can help to alleviate this burden and tap on this demographic group to contribute to society. Moreover, opportunities are created with an increasing elderly population. Essentially, the issue of an aging population is a complex one which will not be easy to tackle, but it is important to remember that all of us will one day grow old, and will also experience lower mobility, slower reactions and health issues. Growing old is part and parcel of life, and even if the elderly are a burden in certain aspects, this burden must be a burden that we are willing to carry.",

Aging is a natural part of life, and it is essential to provide the elderly with the support they need to age gracefully. This support includes access to healthcare, social services, and other facilities that cater to their needs. Caring for the elderly is not only the responsibility of the family but also the government and society as a whole.\n\nLastly, it is essential to shift our perspective and see the elderly as individuals with rights and needs, rather than as a burden on society. They deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and their contributions to society should be valued. We must recognize that the elderly are an integral part of our society, and we must work together to create a society that is inclusive of all age groups.\n\nIn conclusion, it is unfair to consider the elderly as a burden on society. They have contributed significantly to the development of our nation, and they continue to be an asset to society. It is important to provide them with the support they need to age gracefully and to recognize their rights and needs.

                "rited or not, it is clear that the elderly do face greater difficulty in employment and that this may strengthen the view that they are not contributors to society but are burdens instead. However, I believe that these negative perspectives can be changed if the elderly are given more opportunities to participate in society and if their contributions are recognized.\nFirstly, the elderly can contribute significantly to society if they are encouraged to participate in the workforce. While it may be true that the elderly may not possess the same skillsets as younger workers, they can act as mentors or advisors to younger employees in many industries. For example, in the education sector, many veteran teachers continue to teach and impart wisdom to younger teachers despite being past their retirement age. Moreover, elderly persons can choose to work in less physically demanding or specialized jobs such as retail or customer service, where their life experience and communicative skills are valuable. According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization in Japan, elderly persons who worked part-time had lower incidence of dementia than those who did not work. This shows that work can serve as a form of mental exercise for the elderly and contribute to their overall well-being. It is undeniable that elderly participation in the workforce can alleviate the burden on younger generations and more importantly, provide them with a sense of purpose and fulfillment.\nSecondly, I believe that sociocultural perspectives of the elderly need to change. The negative views of the elderly as burdens to society are often shaped by predominant attitudes towards ageing, which are often negative. Many view ageing as associated with a loss of productivity and independence, and this is often reinforced by media portrayals of the elderly as being frail or suffering from illnesses. Therefore, I believe that it is important to change these perspectives by recognizing the contributions of elderly persons and creating more opportunities for them to participate in society. This can be done through intergenerational programs that aim to facilitate social interaction between the youth and elderly persons, or by creating campaigns that highlight the positive aspects of ageing such as personal growth and wisdom. By doing so, it is hoped that societies can shift their perspectives towards the elderly and recognize that they too have much to offer and should not be unjustly dismissed as burdens.\nIn conclusion, while it is easy to fall into the trap of viewing the elderly as burdens to society, I strongly believe that there are many ways in which they can continue to contribute and create value. By encouraging elderly participation in the workforce and changing sociocultural perspectives towards ageing, we can create a more inclusive and supportive society where the elderly are valued members of our community.",

They are viewed as unable to keep up with the changing times and technology, making them a liability in the workforce. \n\nHowever, I believe that this view of the elderly as burdensome is an unfair and outdated stereotype. It is true that the elderly may require greater public expenditure, but they are by no means useless or lacking in value. In fact, many elderly persons are highly skilled and experienced, possessing a valuable wealth of knowledge and expertise that can be harnessed for the benefit of society. Moreover, the elderly have a unique perspective and accumulated wisdom that comes with age, and this can be a valuable asset in certain sectors such as policymaking, where an interdisciplinary approach is increasingly being adopted. \n\nRather than viewing the elderly as a burden, we need to change our mindsets to recognize the value they can bring to society. This can be done by encouraging elderly participation in the workforce through targeted programs and initiatives, such as job retraining and skills upgrading. Furthermore, it is important to promote a more positive and respectful perception of the elderly in the media, schools, and other institutions. By doing so, we can help to combat ageism and foster greater societal harmony. \n\nIn conclusion, the issue of aging populations is a complex one that requires a multifaceted approach. While it is true that the elderly may pose a financial burden on public finances and families, they are by no means a liability or lacking in value. Rather, they can continue to contribute to society in a meaningful way if given the opportunity and the right support.

                "rited or not, the perception of the elderly as \"unproductive\" makes it difficult for them to enter or remain in the workforce.\nDespite these challenges, I believe that the elderly should not be viewed solely as a burden to society. Firstly, the elderly have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can be passed on to the younger generation. Many retired professionals choose to become volunteer mentors or advisors to startups and small businesses, sharing their experience and knowledge on how to navigate through the oftentimes turbulent waters of entrepreneurship. Such efforts are valuable as they help to foster an inter-generational exchange of knowledge that should be encouraged.\nSecondly, the elderly can continue to contribute to the country by engaging in part-time or flexible work arrangements. Many elderly persons may not be able to work full-time due to their physical limitations, but this does not mean that they cannot contribute. According to a 2019 survey by the Ministry of Manpower, the proportion of elderly persons aged 65 and above who were employed or looking for jobs rose from 22.1% in 2009 to 28.1% in 2019. This shows that elderly participation in the workforce can be encouraged if the right policies and incentives are put in place. One way is to offer financial incentives to companies who hire elderly workers. This serves as a win-win situation as companies can tap on the experience of the elderly while also contributing to societal goals.\nLastly, it is important to change the sociocultural attitudes towards the elderly. The elderly should not be viewed solely through the lens of their economic worth. Instead, we should treat the elderly with respect and dignity, recognizing their contributions to society throughout their lives. In Japan, there is a culture of respect towards the elderly, and elderly persons are valued for their wisdom and life experiences. This positive view of the elderly can be emulated in other countries, and it is a key factor in encouraging elderly participation in society and reducing the burdens that are often ascribed to them.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly may pose a financial burden to society, I believe that they can continue to contribute if their participation in the workforce is encouraged and sociocultural attitudes towards them are changed. Rather than solely focusing on the economic costs of an aging population, we should recognize that the elderly have a wealth of experience and knowledge that can be shared with the younger generation, and that they can continue to contribute to society in many ways.",
                "rited or not, it is clear that aging hinders contemporary productivity, and hence the elderly may be seen as a burden in terms of their relevance to the current economy.\nHowever, I believe that the elderly can continue to make a significant contribution to society and the economy if their skills are harnessed in the right way. For example, seniors possess a wealth of experience that no youngsters can bestow. This experience is highly valued in fields such as mentoring, advising and teaching, or jobs which require intricate attention to detail which comes with experience, such as in academia, research and consulting. In addition, seniors can often bring a unique perspective to the table as they often possess a great deal of knowledge of the past which can be put to use in social history research projects or in writing memoirs. In healthcare, older nurses and doctors with their wealth of experience may even be more effective in dealing with certain illnesses or patient types, as medical issues in the elderly may require special expertise due to the specific health requirements of the aged. Even in customer service, seniors with their patience, empathy and communication skills can excel at dealing with customers and patients, hence contributing positively to the economy. Thus, if elderly participation is encouraged in such sectors, they can continue to make meaningful contributions to society.\nMoreover, we need to change our sociocultural perspectives of the elderly. The elderly are often viewed through a lens of negativity, either seen as a burden, irrelevant or simply disregarded. These perspectives are often entrenched in cultural values, and hence we need to change mindsets in order to recognize the worth of seniors. Initiatives such as Retirement and Re-employment Act in Singapore, or the Joint Employment Test or JET in Japan, can serve to help seniors secure employment or remain in employment longer. In the UK, a third of the elderly population volunteer, and initiatives like these need to be encouraged, supported and valued. Alongside these initiatives, society should also value and acknowledge the elderly as they once were the creators of the economy. The elderly should be respected for the contributions they have made to society and the knowledge and experience that they bring. A \u201csilverback\u201d in societies until the turn of the century, the elderly should hold a special position of value as pillars of experience, wisdom, and intellect.\nIn conclusion, the elderly can make meaningful contributions to society and the economy if they are given the opportunity to do so. Instead of seeing them as a burden, we need to encourage elderly participation in certain sectors, recognize their value and efficacy in these sectors, and change sociocultural perspectives of the elderly. As the saying goes, \"With age comes wisdom\" and if we can leverage the experiences and abilities of the elderly population, they can be a significant force for good in our community.",
                "rited or not, it certainly reinforces the notion that elderly persons are economically irrelevant.\nHowever, I believe that the elderly can still contribute to society if they are given the opportunity to do so. One way to achieve this is to encourage elderly participation in the workforce. This can be done through policies such as age-friendly workplaces and re-skilling initiatives. Countries like Japan and South Korea have already implemented such policies to allow elderly persons to remain in the workforce, thereby increasing their contributions to the economy. Another way to change societal perspective is to shift from viewing the elderly as burdens to viewing the elderly as valuable sources of wisdom and experience. The elderly can provide insights into history, tradition, and culture that would otherwise be lost if they were excluded from active participation in society. Furthermore, they can pass on their knowledge and experience to the younger generation, which can then help to promote inter-generational cohesion.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly may impose some economic and emotional burdens on society, I believe that they can still contribute if we change our perspective and provide sufficient opportunities for them to do so. Policies which promote elderly participation in the workforce and promote inter-generational cohesion may help to ameliorate the negative views of the elderly as burdens and recognize the value that they can bring to society. It is important to remember that the elderly have much to offer if we give them the chance and change our mindsets towards them, ultimately making a stronger and more cohesive society.",
                "ant to be discriminatory or not, it is clear that the elderly may not be perceived as valuable contributors to society.\nHowever, I believe that the elderly should not be viewed solely as a burden. Rather, the elderly have much to offer to society if we change our perspectives and encourage their participation in the workforce and community. Firstly, the elderly can be valuable contributors to the workforce given their wealth of experience and knowledge. They have years of experience and through this experience, they may possess invaluable knowledge and wisdom which can only be gained through time. For instance, age could be an advantage in industries such as consulting where valuable advice is required given context and experience. Furthermore, senior citizens would be an especially valuable resource as they suffered through past economic crises, wars and political movements. They hold ideas that are resourceful in problem-solving, such as having tried and tested ideas that experience has taught them. Thus, if encouraged to participate in the workforce, the elderly could be valuable contributors and assets to society.\nSecondly, the elderly can also participate in community activities, and help in caring for the young and the vulnerable. In many societies, it is common for senior citizens to look after their grandchildren while their parents go to work. This support has been valuable in lessening the financial and emotional costs on working parents. Furthermore, elderly citizens can use their time, skills and expertise to volunteer in various community initiatives such as neighborhood watch, which contributes to safety, or acting as mentors for youths who need guidance and support. This way, some of their time can be spent productively and imbued with a sense of purpose, thereby reducing their dependency on public expenditure.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly may indeed require greater support and expenditure, it is important to recognize that they should not be seen solely as a burden. There are opportunities for the elderly to continue contributing to society, whether through participation in the workforce or through community initiatives. It is also important to change our sociocultural perspectives of the elderly and appreciate the value and knowledge they carry. With a rapidly aging population in many developed economies, we should encourage greater participation of seniors in the workforce and community, as they are still capable of being valuable contributors towards society.",
                "rited or not, it is clear that the elderly may be viewed as a liability and an obstacle to the continued growth of the economy. However, I believe that the elderly can continue to contribute positively to society and policymakers should therefore focus beyond the costs to also consider the potential benefits of the elderly.\n\nFirstly, elderly participation in the workforce can be encouraged by extending the retirement age, offering training programs to update their skillsets and incentivising firms to hire the elderly. The Singapore government recently announced that it will be raising the retirement age to 65 by 2030 to encourage elderly workers to continue working. Similarly, companies that hire the elderly can receive tax breaks and subsidies in many developed countries. This will help ensure that the elderly continue to contribute to the economy and to their own financial sustainability.\n\nSecondly, we need to change the sociocultural perspectives of society towards the elderly. Ageism is a prevalent issue and as a society, we need to recognise the immense contributions and value that the elderly bring. Elderly persons can bring about benefits and opportunities in certain sectors, such as the tourist industry which relies on their unique knowledge and experience to provide a memorable experience for their customers. Furthermore, the elderly can also act as mentors, role models, and volunteers, providing crucial support to their communities and society-at-large.\n\nIn conclusion, while the burden of supporting the elderly is real, it is important to recognise the potential benefits that the elderly bring. Instead of viewing the elderly as liabilities, we should focus on encouraging their participation in the workforce, changing sociocultural perspectives towards them and recognising their unique value. With an aging population in many developed countries, implementing such measures is crucial for ensuring the continued satisfaction of the elderly and the sustainability of the economy.",
                "ntally or physically discriminatory, it is highly prevalent in many societies and this further increases the perception that the elderly are a burden.\nHowever, despite the negative views of the elderly as burdens to society, it is vital that we recognize the value and contributions that senior citizens can bring to our communities and economies. One way in which the elderly can contribute is through their skills. Many senior citizens have a wealth of knowledge, skills and experience obtained through their years of work. This includes expertise in fields such as management and technical know-how. The older cohort also possesses more soft skills such as emotional intelligence and interpersonal communication which are valuable in many workplaces. By harnessing this practical experience, senior citizens can serve as mentors to younger workers, or provide consultancy advice to fresh startups. Singapore, for instance, has launched the National Silver Academy which offers seniors over 50 years old courses on IT skills, languages and arts. This encourages lifelong learning and provides opportunities for seniors to upgrade their skills and stay relevant to the current workforce.\nMoreover, the elderly can bring about benefits and opportunities in certain sectors. With an aging population, sectors such as healthcare and eldercare are likely to expand, hence leading to a rise in job opportunities in these fields. CNBC notes that the home healthcare industry is expected to balloon to a worth of $300 billion by 2020. Moreover, older adults are more inclined to volunteer for social activities than younger folks. A study by RSVP Singapore Volunteers which comprises of mainly seniors, demonstrated that volunteering among seniors was associated with enhanced cognitive, physical and psychological well-being. When more seniors volunteer, more elderly-related programmes can be established and this creates more job opportunities while alleviating societal burdens on the healthcare and welfare sector. Furthermore, consumer preferences may also shift as senior citizens become the largest age group, creating business opportunities for companies and organizations that cater to their needs.\nLastly, I believe that socio-cultural perceptions must be changed to address the overarching problem of negative stereotypes towards the elderly. While it is true that people are living longer, healthier and more active lifestyles than ever before, it is important to remember that aging is a natural biological process that every person will experience. The elderly should not be derided or viewed as a burden, but rather, as valued and respected members of our society who have earned the right to rest and enjoy their golden years. Public initiatives to promote intergenerational bonding, such as Silver Circles in Singapore, can be encouraged. These initiatives bring together elderly persons with youths and foster social integration and mutual understanding between the generations. Moreover, nurturing respect and acceptance of elderly persons takes time and effort as it requires a shift in societal perspectives. However, when communities start embracing and appreciating the elderly for their intrinsic value as individuals, it will lead to more opportunities for seniors to give back and contribute.\nIn conclusion, while the aging population presents societal and economic challenges, the elderly should not be written off as burdensome or extraneous to society. The elderly have the potential to be valuable contributors to society and the workforce. By providing opportunities for seniors to continue working, recognize the skills and knowledge they bring, and changing how we view the elderly, we can increase their contributions and outlook on aging.",
                "rited or not is another question, but it is clear that ageism is an issue in today's society. This leads to further isolation and limited opportunities for the elderly to continue contributing to society. Hence, the elderly are seen as less relevant and in many cases, a burden to the economy.\nDespite these perceived burdens, I firmly believe that the elderly can bring a lot of benefits to society if we change our perspectives on them. Firstly, the elderly can continue to contribute to the economy by participating in the workforce. In Singapore, the government has implemented initiatives such as the Silver Wage Bonus, the re-employment of senior citizens and the Senior Employment Credit to incentivize companies to hire and train older workers. These programs have proved to be successful, with more elderly being employed in recent years. By working, the elderly can not only support themselves but also contribute to the economy by providing tax revenue and keeping goods and services flowing. Companies can also benefit from their wealth of experience, which is invaluable in many sectors such as healthcare, retail, and customer service. For example, in Japan, where there is a severe labour shortage, companies are now tapping into the vast pool of elderly workers by hiring them as part-time or temporary staff.\nSecondly, the elderly can provide emotional and social benefits to society. With their life experiences and knowledge, they can offer guidance to youths and impart important values and morals. They can also provide care and support for their grandchildren and help to alleviate the financial stress of younger generations. Furthermore, the elderly can contribute to the preservation of traditions and heritage. This is increasingly important in today's rapidly changing world, where traditions and cultural practices are at risk of being lost. In Singapore, there are many active senior citizen communities who participate in cultural events, volunteer work and continue to pursue lifelong learning. In doing so, the elderly bring about intangible benefits to society and enrich cultural diversity.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the elderly may pose certain financial and emotional burdens to society, it is imperative that we change our mindsets and recognize the benefits that they can bring. We should not view the elderly as a problem but rather as an important resource in our economies and communities. By encouraging their participation in the workforce and recognizing their value in society, we can build a more inclusive and resilient society, where everyone can contribute regardless of age.",
                "rited or not, it is clear that many seniors in the workforce are not valued as much as younger workers. Given these issues, it is understandable why some may see the elderly as a burden to society.\n\nHowever, I argue that there is a need to change our perspectives of the elderly and recognize the immense contributions they can make. Firstly, the elderly can bring about benefits in certain sectors. For instance, in fields such as education, healthcare and social work, the elderly have valuable experience and knowledge which can be put to good use. They are able to provide guidance and mentorship to younger generations, and in doing so create a sense of intergenerational connection. Furthermore, as demand for healthcare services increases with an aging population, there will be growing demand for healthcare professionals, many of whom may be seniors. In Japan and South Korea, the trend of recruiting the elderly in the caregiving industry has gone mainstream, and this has proved to be a sustainable solution to tackling the issue of an aging workforce. Therefore, it is clear that the elderly can bring about benefits to certain fields.\n\nSecondly, encouraging elderly participation in the workforce can lead to a stronger economy. With the rise of the gig economy, there are opportunities for the elderly to take up part-time work in fields such as food delivery or ride-sharing services. Given that many Singaporeans are living longer and are healthier, the elderly are now more capable of staying in the workforce for a longer period of time. In fact, there have been calls in Japan for elderly workers to continue working to mitigate the effects of an aging population. If the elderly continue to work, they are able to contribute tax revenue to the economy and also stay active, which has been linked to improved mental and physical health.\n\nFinally, changing sociocultural perspectives of the elderly is important. It is high time we recognize the elderly not only as caretakers of solid cultural traditions, but also as individuals with agency and contributions to give. Institutions such as schools, community centers and workplaces can play an active role in changing the negative stereotypes of the elderly by promoting meaningful encounters and interactions with seniors.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable why some may view the elderly as a burden to society, there is a need to change our perspectives and recognize the immense contributions they can give. Encouraging elderly participation in the workforce, recognizing the benefits they can bring to certain fields, and changing sociocultural perspectives of the elderly are all steps that can be taken to ensure that our senior citizens are not only given the care they require, but also celebrated for the contributions they have made, and will continue to make."

            "human_gen_truncate": "esearch opens up the possibility for such research to be abused and exploited. Research done in stem-cell therapy, cloning, and organ transplants are experimental at best. The results have been inconsistent, and these procedures have not been widely accepted by the medical community. As a result, expecting such genetic engineering processes to improve one'squality of life is quixotic. Nevertheless, as scientists continue to dabble with research of questionable nature, hoping to make a ground-breaking discovery, there is a possibility that ethics and morality will be sacrificed. With the technology to precisely and accurately edit human genetic sequences within reach, designing humans are no longer just a science fiction fantasy. The arrival of CRISPR technology, though still in its nascent stage, has the potential to excise undesirable genes and insert favourable ones into gametes and embryos in a process called germ line engineering, allowing couples to select traits they wish their child to have and potentially turning the concept of designer babies into a frightening reality. Given that the eugenics movement, which essentially proclaimed that all were created equal, but some were more equal than others, had entered the mainstream consciousness as recently as the 19thand 20thcentury, research along these lines might be exploited by the most radical amongst us. Furthermore, the concept is also offensive to many religious groups who believe that it is wrong to \"play God\" by effectively creating and changing life, as well as opposing the law of nature. It can be evinced clearly that the sheer magnitude in terms of expectations placed on biotechnology, could easily raise ethical and moral concerns, especially if it threatens the very essence of human life.\nProponents of medical science would however argue otherwise, stating that faith placed upon medicine and health research is certainly not misplaced, given that it has brought about innumerable benefits to humanity. Its merits span from the early diagnosis and management of life threatening diseases, to the eradication of pandemics that once plagued the world. Admittedly, the positive impact of medical science has been long lasting, which may coax people into accepting it wholeheartedly. Medical science has successfully identified the causes of infectious diseases and destroyed the carriers of such bacteria and viruses. Dedicated research and experimentation have given rise to vaccines and antibiotics to combat such maladies. This was well-demonstrated in the cases of polio and smallpox, where in collaboration with the World Health Organization, medical resources were able to reduce the prevalence of such diseases. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative reduced the number of cases of polio by 99% and more than 2 billion children have been immunized. The negative effects of smallpox were also short-lived as it was officially eradicated in 1980. It has been estimated that at least 20 million people would have died of smallpox had it not been eradicated. People may also pin their hopes on pharmacogenomic research and the concept of personalized medicine, which is administered with the understanding that individuals may have different responses to drugs due to different genes. Medco Health Solutions, one of America'slargest pharmacy benefit managers until it was acquired by Express Solutions in 2011, was leading the way in making the provision of personal genomics services to the masses a reality. It had already achieved successes with personalized treatment of Warfarin, a widely used blood thinner to prevent clots, and Tamoxifen for breast cancer. Essentially, matching the right drugs to the patients not only has obvious clinical benefits, but also makes good economic sense. By reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis, long hospitalization periods and the need for follow up treatment, personalized healthcare can generate significant cost savings. All of these will ultimately allow patients to direct their own care to some extent, empowering them with a greater sense of freedom and self-reliance, truly heralding a breakthrough in medical science. Advances in personalised medicine would also allow for the treatment of rare disorders and allow the industry to track the development of diseases. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the National Healthcare System is collaborating with academia and industry to analyse the genetic material of persons with rare disorders through the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is hoped that such information will shed light on and save lives from disorders which were previously unknown. Indubitably, the public validation of medical science especially in keeping infectious diseases at bay and enhancing their health by providing personalized medicine is indeed justifiable and in no way a gross exaggeration of our gargantuan trust on medical science.\nIn sum, medical science remains essential and indispensable due to the benefits it has on the well-being of Man. As this branch of science continues to expand, evolve and develop, it is inevitable that mankind would place much of their hopes and utmost faith in it to provide them with enhanced longevity. However, past and present experiences have revealed that this may not necessarily be a wise decision, as it poses risks that may be catastrophic if not cured in time. It is imperative that ethical restrictions be present to act as a moral compass and ensure that our desires and trust do not tip the scale, lest we might find ourselves being reduced to soulless beings, stripped of our mental faculties and perhaps, depending on soma, in the near future.",

With rapid advancements in medical research, there is a growing pressure on scientists to produce innovative, groundbreaking procedures. This has led to a wave of untested, unproven medical methods being performed on patients who believe that they are getting the latest and best treatment available. This is evident in Japan, where a doctor was arrested in 2018 for developing a fraudulent stem cell therapy that claimed to cure heart disease. The treatment had not been subjected to any clinical trials or peer-reviewed research. It was only after five patients were hospitalised with critical medical conditions that authorities realised the danger of these untested treatments. Similarly, a woman in Thailand died after undergoing a stem cell treatment in a clinic, which was not registered with any medical authority in the country. In spite of this, a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center shows that 70% of Americans have a \"great deal\" of trust in medical doctors, with 67% believing that medical research is done in the public's best interests. However, what they fail to recognise is the fact that not all medical research is safe, effective or even scientifically valid, given the race to be the first to market a new treatment, which can ultimately harm the patient. This overconfidence in medical research and the belief that the latest technology trumps tried-and-tested methods has a potential to endanger people's lives.\nIn conclusion, while medical science has played a significant role in prolonging and improving the quality of human life, there are negative consequences to placing blind faith in it.

It is crucial that people who place trust in the medical industry realise that it remains a field that is constantly evolving, with new treatments and procedures emerging regularly. Hence, it is vital that they take the time to ask questions, do their own research, and seek second opinions from reputable sources before making any medical or health decisions.

Those who advocate for alternative treatments to cancer abound, with the internet being a hotbed of homemade remedies, teas, and diets, all clamouring to cure cancer. The danger with such untested theories is that it creates a false sense of hope which often, leads to disastrous consequences. On a similar note, a gene-editing tool known as CRISPR, has been championed as the future of medicine, with the potential to cure some of mankind's most pressing diseases such as sickle cell anaemia and cystic fibrosis, amongst others. However, the technology is still in its embryonic stage, with a lot of work needed before it can be deemed safe for extensive use. Despite this fact, rogue researchers have exploited the blind faith that people have placed in CRISPR and tried to experiment with it in untested ways leading to the unethical alteration of DNA in human embryos. This misinterpretation of the possibilities of medical science poses a threat to society, that could result in people being subjected to gruelling treatments that only end in increased pain, grief and even, death.\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there is the startling reality of medical distrust in certain conservative communities and anti-vaccination campaigns. Such communities have denounced medical science, at times, attributing certain sicknesses to religious factors leading to a lack of trust in medical practitioners. The black community in the United States is an example of a group that faces rampant discrimination in the healthcare sector, causing a lack of trust in the field. This mistrust has made members of the community reluctant to seek medical attention, even if it is due to ailments that could easily be dealt with, thereby trading their well-being for the comfort of fortifying their beliefs that health issues among their members are not common. Anti-vaccination campaigns are another case in point, with individuals purporting that vaccines are more harmful than good for their kids, painting medical science wrongly to be the cause of some autistic menaces that could easily be managed if properly handled. The spread of the measles in America due to a decrease in vaccination uptake is an example of the dangerous consequences of blindly distrusting medical science.\n\nIn conclusion, faith in medical science is necessary for our society but we must be aware of the potential consequences of being excessively reliant on it. The human body is inherently fallible, and although medical science has progressed considerably, it still has its limitations. People must be more open to lifestyle changes, such as healthy living, healthy eating and do away with drug culture. Medical science should not be viewed as the cure to all ailments but rather co-operate with it to foster a more holistic way of life. Blind faith in untested theories and treatments that are not regulated poses a threat to the entire health sector, and the general public. Trust must still be championed but in a regulated, reasoned, and informed manner.",
                "esearch can also be detrimental to patients. Such faith is usually the result of the media successfully hyping up the supposed groundbreaking experiments and trials that researchers and surgeons have conducted. This is particularly so when it pertains to cancer, Alzheimer's and HIV/AIDS research. In a race against time, desperate patients and families tend to jump at the opportunity to participate in treatments with razor thin safety regulations or take medication that has not been tested thoroughly. This was the sorry fate of Jesse Gelsinger, a promising 18-year-old in 1999, who volunteered to partake in a gene therapy trial. Instead of ridding him of his illness, the therapy aggravated it, leading to his death. The tragedy sent shockwaves through the medical community, prompting regulators to scrutinize and regulate trials way more rigorously. The public's overzealous faith in medical experiments can prove to be unruly and dangerous if proper measures are not taken to regulate the approval process.\nInterestingly, and perhaps contradictorily, there are also instances in which people have little faith in medical science. This happens when unpredictable circumstances crop up that cause the effectiveness of medical science to wane. These unexpected and unanticipated obstacles could be medical complications or discrepancies during surgeries, a lack of proper diagnosis or the emergence of a new strain of virus that has a resistance to existing vaccines, or a host of other issues. The confusion and uncertainty that arises from such scenarios can lead to the erosion of public trust in medical science, impacting the work of medical practitioners negatively. An example includes the egg contamination case in 2010, where German authorities erroneously blamed Spanish cucumbers for the outbreak of a particularly virulent strain of E.Coli bacteria, leading to food scares and adverse effects on the Spanish cucumber industry. \nIn conclusion, the increasing importance of health in the 21st century coupled with the ever-evolving medical industry has propelled people to place an inordinate amount of confidence in medical science. Some of the consequences pertaining to such trust include the blind reliance on drugs and treatments, the unhealthy obsession with cosmetic surgeries, and the misjudgment of untested medical experiments. Public trust in medical science needs to be regulated, and should not be too extreme to an extent that people ought to misplace their trust on the cutting-edge technology that it offers.",
                "esearch has also led to major ethical concerns. A notable example is the case of genetic engineering of human embryos using CRISPR, a revolutionary gene-editing tool. Advocates are pushing for the use of this technique to eliminate genetic disorders in newborns by manipulating the embryos' DNA before they are implanted into the womb. This technology could potentially eradicate certain disorders that have plagued humans for centuries. However, the idea of tinkering with the genetic make-up of a human is largely untested and carries significant ethical implications. Many people have raised concerns on the impact on future generations, the potential misuse and abuse of the technology, unequal access to the procedure and concerns over the \"slippery slope\" that this technology could lead us on. The lack of caution and disregard for long-term consequences in this rush to deploy technology to fix every problem bears testimony to society's misconstrued understanding of medical science's limits and potential hazards.\nOn the other extreme end of the spectrum, some people could be rejecting medical science due to various factors such as cultural or religious beliefs, fear or mistrust of medical professionals, or just a lack of awareness. Such people subject themselves to conditions that are easily preventable or curable, at the expense of their physical wellbeing. In Singapore, there is a community of people who have sought traditional Chinese medicine practitioners instead of conventional western medicine. While there are benefits associated with using traditional Chinese medicine, such as reduced side effects or fewer negative consequences, the lack of scientific research associated with its effectiveness leaves it open to debate. Such alternative medicine could be detrimental to the patient's health if they replace conventional medical treatments for life-threatening illnesses with traditional remedies. This attitude towards health poses a major problem, as it encourages a mistrust of modern medical science, and could lead to greater health risks by foregoing proven medical treatments.\nIn conclusion, society needs to strike an appropriate balance when it comes to the trust placed in medical science, neither shying away from it nor blindly embracing its every claim. It is important that society understands the limits of medical technology and not fall prey to the belief that they can cure all problems with medication and treatments, nor should they be skeptical of medicine because of untested, unproven beliefs. There needs to be a cautious, measured approach to medical science to ensure that we do not unnecessarily trivialise its significance or put blind faith in untested medical treatments. Medical advancements have played a vital role in improving human life, but this can only be sustained if society has a realistic understanding of its potential and limitations.",
                "esearch and treatments, without taking into account the potential consequences, could also result in negative ramifications. The recent controversy surrounding the genetic engineering of babies using CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology by He Jiankui, a Chinese scientist, elucidates the dangers of overconfidence in medical technology. An international panel of scientists released a statement in the wake of this scandal, expressed that there were \"crucial scientific uncertainties surrounding GERMLINE editing\" and called for an international moratorium to be established on such research. Such considerations may have been overlooked by the Chinese scientist, who proceeded to insert edited genes into several embryos, ultimately resulting in the birth of genetically modified babies. This act has sparked international outrage and concerns over unforeseeable consequences of genetic modification of human DNA. It is evident that over-reliance on medical technology carries serious risks and hence requires caution and restraint.\nTo conclude, the advancements in medical science has certainly changed our lives, leading to a longer lifespan and better medical treatment options. However, it is imperative that we as individuals do not place an excessive amount of trust in medical science, and supplement our reliance on it with a healthy lifestyle. It is also important that medical science's limitations and unpredictable outcomes are taken into account before engaging in risky treatments and procedures.",
                "emedies has also led to the undermining of well-established medical practices. A prime example would be the anti-vaccine movement that has been spreading like wildfire on social media, driven by fears of vaccines causing autism and other health conditions. This has caused parents to refuse vaccinations for their children, leading to outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles, mumps and rubella. The World Health Organisation expressed concern over the increasing number of measles cases globally, with a five-fold increase in cases reported in the first quarter of 2019, compared to the same period in 2018. This is a worrisome trend that demonstrates how public faith in medical science can have drastic consequences, especially when it comes to public health and safety. The backlash against traditional medicine is also evident in various cultures, where people opt for alternative treatments such as acupuncture and herbal medicines, which may not be supported by scientific evidence or proven effective.\nIn summary, the advancements in medical science have indeed provided many benefits, but the unbridled trust placed on it could lead to negative consequences such as overreliance on drugs, cosmetic surgeries, and alternative medicine, as well as underestimating the importance of preventive measures such as a healthy lifestyle and vaccination. Therefore, the balance between public trust in medical science and prudent caution must be kept in check to ensure that medical science can offer sustainable benefits to society.",
                "esearch and treatments within the medical field also poses a substantial risk to both patients and the field of medicine as a whole. The desire for immediate and permanent solutions has led to the increasing popularity of untested \"miracle cures\" such as stem cell therapies. Stem cell therapy, which utilises the body's own stem cells to regenerate damaged or diseased tissue, has garnered immense attention in the medical community due to its purported ability to treat a wide range of ailments such as diabetes, Parkinson's Disease, multiple sclerosis and even cancer. This enthusiasm has led to a sharp increase in stem cell clinics which offer unproven treatments for exorbitant prices, taking advantage of desperate patients who are willing to try anything. Even though there is yet to be conclusive research to support the efficacy of these treatments, people continue to flock to them due to their misplaced faith in medical science. An investigation conducted by the Centre for Responsible Nanotechnology found that most stem cell clinics in the United States lacked proper licensing and credentials, resulting in dangerous and unpredictable outcomes. In the worst case scenario, patients have even died from complications as a result of these treatments. This lack of oversight exacerbates risks towards patients and decimates the credibility of the medical community, demonstrating the dire consequences of trusting medical science blindly.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that medical science has greatly improved healthcare and the well-being of individuals worldwide, the unwavering faith that people place upon it can simultaneously result in negative outcomes. The belief that medical technology can cure all ailments and enhance the human body often leads to unhealthy lifestyles and increased reliance on medication, and the thriving cosmetic and stem cell industries amplify the risks associated with medical treatments. Therefore, it is imperative that individuals take responsibility for their own health, and that governments and regulatory bodies play a stronger role in overseeing the medical industry, rather than blindly trusting the field of medical science as an omnipotent remedy for all issues.",
                "esearch can also be detrimental. Medical science has been known to suffer from \"hype cycles, \" wherein a new product or device is raved about as a groundbreaking watershed moment, only to be discovered shortly thereafter that it does not deliver the promised results. The Theranos case is a prime example. The company claimed to have developed a revolutionary technology capable of running a comprehensive range of diagnostic tests from just a drop of blood, rather than using the conventional method of drawing blood from patients. Investors heavily backed the company, and it was valued at $9 billion, with Holmes named as the youngest self-made billionaire. However, the success of Theranos was built on fraudulent claims and deceit, and it was later exposed that the tests were grossly inaccurate and posed a potential threat to patient safety. The hype surrounding untested medical science can, therefore, result in adverse effects, including the loss of money and endangerment to patients. If medical science continues to be trusted blindly, there is a danger that it might bring about widespread panic and disrupt societal norms. \nIn conclusion, medical science has come a long way and has indeed benefited society by prolonging life and enhancing healthcare. However, the blind trust that many people place in it can be problematic. The overuse of medical treatments to correct problems that could have been avoided through simple modifications of lifestyle choices, the obsessive attention on cosmetic treatments to alter physical appearances, and the overhype of untested medical procedures could prove to be very dangerous. It is, therefore, important to approach medical science with a critical mindset and not as a cure for every ailment or problem.",
                "esearch has also resulted in unwarranted medical procedures. This is evident in the experimental treatments that dominate medical research. Medical science is a field that is constantly evolving, and through research, new medical procedures are created. These procedures are in their early stages may not have undergone the critical testing required to determine their safety and effectiveness. Yet, patients flock to be test subjects without considering the uncertain results that could ensue and the potential harm they could be exposed to. One such example is the human growth hormone treatment given to children who have no deficiency in the hormone. The treatment, which costs more than $20,000 in a year, is touted as a miracle cure for shortness. However, the treatment, which is currently not approved for medicinal use, possesses harmful side effects such as increased risk of developing cancer and diabetes. Another example would be the overwhelming enthusiasm among some cancer patients to undergo untested treatments. These patients are often aware that these treatments have not undergone the standard clinical trials and are often taken after struggling with the disappointment of chemotherapy failure. Despite the lack of evidence supporting the effectiveness of such treatments in curing cancer, patients put their lives at risk by agreeing to them. The dependence on untested treatments would not only expose patients to harm but would also divert health resources from tested and approved treatments which are reliably effective.\nIn the end, it must be noted that having trust in the advancements of medical science is not a bad thing. After all, medical science has cured and managed diseases that formerly led to death. Its ability to repair and modify certain aspects of the human body is also awe-inspiring. However, this trust should be balanced with a healthy dose of skepticism and caution. Ironically, treating medicine as inerrant in its cures and treatments could result in worse health outcomes, providing undeniable evidence of the fact that medical science is neither infallible nor perfect. It is only through striking a balance between trust and caution that patients, their loved ones and the medical fraternity can benefit from the potential of medical science.",
                "esearch that has not been rigorously scrutinised or adhere to scientific standards could also be perilous. Medical science is inherently unpredictable, with unanticipated effects that may result during clinical trials. This was observed in the disastrous clinical trial conducted at a French drug testing facility, which resulted in the death of a volunteer and the hospitalisation of four others. The trial was conducted on an experimental drug which was yet to be tested on humans. The eager participant volunteers hoped to make a quick buck from the trial that promised to pay them. However, the trial resulted in their lives being endangered, with one dead and four suffering from severe neurological injuries. The severity of such cases leads us to question the efficacy of the medical research conducted and the reliability of our supposed experts. Such incidents remind us that there may be hidden consequences, that may not be immediately apparent which accompany medical science at its utmost level of progress.\nIn conclusion, medical science has indeed proven to be a force of good, enabling the scientific community to offer relief to patients and their families by attending to their medical needs and demands. However, with progress come limitations and the need to accept what medical science is capable of achieving. The distinct possibility exists of misplaced trust in this field, with people substituting medical cures for a healthy lifestyle and relying on untested medical experiments to solve their issues. The need of the hour is to acknowledge the reality of medical science, its capabilities and its shortcomings so that we can ensure that it benefits us only in ways that we can fully understand and reliably predict."

            "human_gen_truncate": "hild-rearing. In France and the Scandinavian countries, which have some of the highest fertility rates in Europe, couples are greatly assisted by the government. A French mother has at least 16 weeks of paid maternity leave as well as guaranteed job security and \u2013 if she has a third child \u2013 a monthly stipend of up to 1,000 Euros for a year. Similarly, in Norway, women are entitled to 10 months of paid maternity leave at their full salary or a year with compensation being about 80% of their salary. Since the policies have been in place for decades, the country'sfertility rates are approaching 2.1, roughly the point where a population is self-sustaining, thereby reducing the need for immigration. Clearly, it is evident that boosting the fertility rate would have a far more pronounced effect on mitigating the effects of an ageing population in the long run.\nNext, there is a trend that is being observed in today'sworld, especially in developed countries and that is the company'swillingness to hire older people. Many organisations recognize that there is a wealth of experience in the elderly that generally goes untapped. Firms organize workshops and skills training programmes to help the elderly remain relevant in the workplace in order to tap on these existing skill sets. This, in turn, renders immigration unnecessary. Examples of such initiatives can be observed in the US, where an association of non-profit groups and the government hold seminars targeted at helping older people hone their skills to increase their employability. In addition, due to the array of retirement options that allow employees to transit gradually to retirement, along with other benefits such as flexible schedules, vetted back-up eldercare and low-impact exercise classes, the National Institute of Health (NIH) of the United States has consistently been ranked as one of the best companies for older workers. This could explain why more than half of their 20,000 workers are aged 50 years or older. These measures would prove to be superfluous, however, if the retirement age is not raised. Across the world, the statutory retirement age has different legal implications: in some countries like Singapore, the retirement age prevents older workers who have not reached the retirement age from being unfairly retrenched on the pretext of old age, while in others workers are guaranteed a pension if they retire upon reaching retirement age. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), many developed countries have already passed legislation that would increase the retirement age in their countries to at least 67 years from 65 by 2050. Ultimately, raising the retirement age will help to address the problem of a dwindling workforce as well as the impending pension crisis. The notion that the elderly can still contribute meaningfully to the workforce and the economy should be popularised, and the necessary changes should be made to re-integrate them back into the workforce.\nIt is also crucial that governments promote active and healthy ageing through public awareness campaigns and education. Indisputably, a rapidly ageing population will place greater demands on the healthcare system. The World Health Organization warns that the social impact of population ageing could be enormous. It predicts a big rise in cancers, coronary heart disease, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases related to ageing. Health experts are also worried that as people get older, they could become more prone to an increasing number of debilitating conditions unless they keep themselves physically active. In Singapore'scontext, research by the University of Washington'sInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggest that Singaporeans spent an average of eight years in ill health even as life expectancy increased to 82. Additionally, research by Duke-NUS Medical School suggests that the percentage of those over 60 years of age suffering from three or more chronic health conditions had more than doubled, from 19.8% in 2009 to 37% in 2017. What this necessarily means is that healthcare systems have had to devote more resources to addressing the needs of the elderly, many of whom will be in and out of hospices. To make matters worse, healthcare costs are on the steady rise and the elderly and their caregivers are struggling to afford essential treatments. Policies which place greater emphasis on community-based care and the prevention and management of chronic ailments are thus more pertinent than ever. Countries and their leaders have responded to this astronomical challenge by publicly funding the healthcare system, best exemplified by England. It subsidizes elderly patients\" medical care expenses through the National Healthcare System and has implemented various programmes like the National Retention Strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment for the elderly. Closer to home, Singapore'sMinistry of Health has introduced a slew of campaigns and financial schemes, such as the $3 billion Action Plan for Successful Ageing, co-payment insurance schemes like Medisave and Medishield to help the elderly cope with medical expenses for age-related ailments. These initiatives will indeed go a long way in addressing the social impacts of a rapidly ageing population.\nIn short, population ageing is in a state of flux today. It is also an intractable problem with no magic silver bullet to solve the issue. As many countries start to experience its pervasive effects, it is vital to consider mitigating the negative aspects of it via a multi-pronged approach, instead of relying on immigration solely to solve the problems associated with population ageing. While immigration seems like the fastest, most feasible way to replace the loss in working adults, in the long run, it may turn out to cause more harmful than beneficial, not to mention that a country cannot depend entirely on immigration as it may not be permanent. Other alternative solutions such as boosting fertility rates, encouraging skills upgrading and providing healthcare and financial support to the elderly should be employed in tandem. Notwithstanding this, immigration, at the moment serves as the most efficient and pragmatic way to supplement the ageing population, but ideally, it has to be complementary to other alternate solutions discussed to inculcate a culture where \"grey is the new gold\".",

This effect could be particularly pronounced in countries where the elderly population size is rapidly increasing. In these countries, a high influx of immigrants could help avoid a demographic catastrophe that could lead to the complete collapse of social welfare systems such as healthcare and pensions.\n\nHowever, there are also potential downsides to relying on immigration to address the problem of an ageing population. Firstly, there may be a negative perception of immigrants among the local population. This can affect their ability to integrate into society and could potentially lead to social unrest. Secondly, there may be a loss of cultural identity as a result of too many immigrants coming into the country. Thirdly, there may be issues related to the exploitation of migrant workers by employers that need to be addressed. Fourthly, the integration of some immigrants into society may prove difficult, particularly if there are language barriers, religious differences or cultural gaps.\n\nIn conclusion, immigration can be a key solution to the issue of ageing populations, but the effectiveness of this approach will depend on the specific circumstances of the country and its people. Immigration can help to bring in younger workers and replenish the workforce, whilst alleviating the cost burdens of an ageing population. However, in implementing this solution, policymakers must also take into account the potential downsides of immigration, such as the loss of cultural identity and resistance from local populations.

Countries such as France and Sweden have implemented pro-family policies, resulting in higher birth rates than other countries. Additionally, raising the retirement age can extend the working lives of older adults, thus offsetting the decrease in productivity due to a shrinking labour force. The retirement age has already been raised in many countries, including the United States, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Lastly, improving healthcare can mitigate the negative effects of ageing on the population. This can be done through the implementation of affordable healthcare standards, research and development into age-related illnesses, and emphasis on preventative healthcare measures such as regular health screenings. Singapore has been a leader in this area, with its strong public healthcare system and innovative approaches to care.\n\nIn conclusion, population ageing is a growing concern globally and governments need to address it with innovative solutions. While immigration is one solution, countries must be mindful of its potential negative effects on wages and social cohesion.

For instance, Singapore has put into place the Baby Bonus Scheme, where cash gifts and other benefits are given to parents to encourage them to have more children. This may not only lead to a larger population, but it would also help to create a larger and younger workforce in future. Furthermore, governments can raise the retirement age and implement measures to prolong active work life. With people living longer, we can no longer view retiring in one's early 60s as being reasonable. Reducing mandatory retirement ages and creating incentives for people to continue to work or return to the workforce after retiring could be viable solutions. Lastly, improving healthcare is another essential component. As populations age, there will be a greater demand for medical care. Governments will have to invest in healthcare facilities and train more healthcare workers to meet the increasingly high demand. Improved healthcare means that the elderly will be able to remain healthy and financially independent as well. In the long run, these measures will help to promote not only economic growth but also social and societal wellbeing that may not be possible with relying on immigration alone.\nIn conclusion, population ageing is an emerging issue with far-reaching consequences that governments have to take seriously and adapt to in their policies. While immigration has been touted as an effective solution for tackling the economic impact of an ageing population, it comes with a host of issues like wage depression, potential cultural conflicts, and social tensions. Thus, the best course of action would be a comprehensive approach involving a mix of strategies, such as promoting more births, prolonging active work life, and improving healthcare.

For example, Singapore has implemented schemes such as the Baby Bonus cash gift and the Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme to financially incentivise couples to have more children. Additionally, governments can explore ways to increase the retirement age beyond the current norm, keeping older workers in the workforce for longer and reducing the percentage of the inactive population. Raising the retirement age not only encourages employees to remain active in the workforce, but it can also help employers deal with severe labour shortages. Governments can also focus on improving healthcare to meet the increasing healthcare demands of an ageing population. Better healthcare facilities, medical technology and healthcare services will surely be necessary to attend to the ageing population. With the advance of new technologies and a greater awareness of healthy living, healthcare can become more efficient and effective. Trending topics such as telemedicine and robotics will revolutionise healthcare in the future, making healthcare more accessible and affordable to ageing societies.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of ageing populations is one that cannot be ignored. Immigration is only a part of the solution to the negative consequences of an ageing population, and it needs to be used cautiously. Other measures such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, and improving healthcare should be considered, and alongside with the necessary infrastructure and policies implemented, to ensure that in the transition towards an ageing society, there is minimal disruption to the economy and the social fabric. As such, governments need to adopt a multi-faceted approach, which is centred on people (and meeting their respective needs), family-friendly interventions, business-friendly measures, support for healthcare and empowering society as a whole.",

The French government, for example, has implemented generous family-friendly policies, which include subsidised childcare, tax credits for families and parental leave that lasts several years. These measures have resulted in an increase in the fertility rates in France from 1.73 to 2.01 between 1995 and 2015. Another possible solution is to raise the retirement age. As people live longer and healthier lives, they can work for extended periods, hence this represents a viable option for governments to address demographic challenges. For instance, in the United States, the retirement age is set to rise to 67 for those born in 1960 or later, a move that is expected to reduce the financial burden on the federal government and address the issues of an ageing population. Besides, governments can improve healthcare to increase life expectancies and ensure that seniors maintain good health which will reduce healthcare expenditure in the long run. As such, these solutions can go a long way to address the challenges faced by an ageing population, even as immigration policies remain a viable solution. \nIn conclusion, while immigration may have its benefits, it also has its pitfalls. The need for policies to address an ageing population remains crucial, and it is essential for governments to evaluate a range of solutions. While it is only prudent for governments to tap on the expertise of the immigrant pool to compensate for the ageing labour force, it is essential that they develop a comprehensive approach that balances the benefits against the potential challenges posed by immigration policies. Alone, immigration may not be sufficient to counter the adverse economic effect of a rapidly ageing population, and governments must consider alternative measures such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, and improving healthcare to meet the needs of their aging populations. The key to success lies in a multi-faceted approach that considers all possible solutions and adopts an integrated set of policies that will be proven effective in the long term.",

For example, Singapore implemented the Baby Bonus Scheme, which provides cash incentives for parents when they have a child, with increasing amounts for each subsequent child. The policy appears to have been effective in boosting birth rates, with the number of births rising from 37,100 in 2002 to 41,000 in 2018, although it is still not enough to offset the decline in the birth rate. Another solution would be to raise the retirement age, which would increase the number of workers in the labour force, as well as delaying the onset of retirement benefits. In Singapore, the retirement age has already been raised gradually from 62 to 65, and is set to increase further to 67 by 2030. This would help to maintain a larger workforce, while reducing the burden on the pension system. Finally, improving the healthcare system would be an effective way of coping with an ageing population. Expanding healthcare coverage and investing in research and development of medical technology would not only enable the elderly to live longer, healthier lives, but also reduce the overall healthcare expenditure. The government has to balance spending on healthcare with other competing priorities, such as education and defence, but a robust healthcare system is an essential aspect of any strategy to tackle the challenges posed by an ageing population.\n\nTo conclude, population ageing is a complex and multi-dimensional issue that requires a careful balance between various solutions. Immigration can be an effective way of supplementing the ageing population, but it comes with its own set of problems. It would therefore be useful for governments to implement a range of strategies, including encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, improving healthcare, and controlling the influx of foreign workers. No single solution is the silver bullet that can solve the problem of population ageing, but a combination of different strategies can help to mitigate its impact and ensure that society can continue to function effectively even in the face of demographic change.",

A recent example of this is Japan, where monetary incentives are offered to parents, alongside measures like increased access to childcare, in order to encourage couples to have more children. Additionally, another solution is to raise the retirement age in order to keep older workers within the workforce for longer. While this may sound unappealing to some, it is becoming increasingly necessary as people are living longer, healthier lives than ever before. Moreover, raising the retirement age could help alleviate the burden on social security institutions, such as the Central Provident Fund (CPF) in Singapore, which have to provide for these retirees. By keeping people employed for longer, governments can save on welfare spending and increase tax revenues. Finally, it is important to focus on improving healthcare standards, particularly in the area of geriatric care, in order to maintain health and well-being among the elderly. Better healthcare services not only maintain the workforce, but also ensure that people can lead longer, more productive and richer lives.\nIn conclusion, population ageing is an urgent issue that needs to be addressed by governments across the world. While immigration policies do present a solution, it is important to approach this issue with care and ensure that these policies do not result in other negative consequences. As outlined, alternatives such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, and improving healthcare standards, can also be considered and implemented alongside immigration policies to counter population ageing.

This can take the form of measures such as parental leave, subsidies for childcare, tax breaks for families with children, and public housing options that cater specifically to families with children. Such policies could encourage young couples to have more children and provide support to working parents who may need to balance work and family responsibilities. Additionally, raising the retirement age could also prove to be an effective solution. By extending the working life of individuals, the government can harness the valuable experience of the elderly population while reducing the financial strain on the national pension systems. This option has become increasingly popular as healthcare and medical technologies have improved, enabling people to work for longer. Finally, there is scope for improving healthcare options for the elderly. This can not only help in extending their lifespan but also improve the quality of life for those who are ageing. Governments can implement policies that focus on the prevention of chronic diseases, early detection of illnesses, and quality long-term care for the elderly. In conclusion, while immigration can be one of the solutions in addressing population ageing, it is not without its drawbacks. There are other solutions that can be pursued alongside immigration policies that can be just as or even more effective, such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, and improving healthcare. It is critical for policymakers to carefully evaluate the potential challenges and benefits of each solution and choose the one that is most appropriate for their society.",

For example, Singapore has introduced a series of measures such as the Baby Bonus Scheme, which grants cash incentives to parents who give birth to or adopt a child. Similarly, in countries like Sweden and Norway, generous parental leave policies have been implemented along with public provision of quality childcare services to ease the burden of raising children. Another solution would be to raise the retirement age. Rather than encouraging immigration, governments could allow citizens to work for a longer period of time thereby contributing to the economy and potentially reducing the impact of ageing populations. Lastly, improving the quality of healthcare, giving rise to an increase in life expectancy may also prove beneficial. By having citizens healthier for a longer period of time, they may be able to work longer, leading to continued economic growth. Furthermore, by encouraging healthy lifestyles, governments may be able to mitigate the healthcare burden associated with ageing populations.\nIn conclusion, there are numerous challenges associated with ageing populations. While immigration may seem an attractive option to supplement declining populations and workforce numbers, it is not without its challenges. Governments must thus approach the problem holistically, recognizing and taking into account the economic, social, and cultural problems arising from immigration, whilst also investing in social and healthcare measures, as well as ensuring that older citizens remain active participants in the workforce. In this way, countries may hope to overcome the challenges of an ageing population and emerge better for it.",

For example, Sweden has introduced a \"use-it-or-lose-it\" paternity leave policy, where fathers receive generous leave that can be taken only by them, making it more convenient for families to have children. In Singapore, the government has introduced a series of initiatives, such as the Baby Bonus Scheme and childcare subsidies to encourage couples to have more children. The effectiveness of such policies can be seen in countries such as France, where pro-natalist policies have resulted in an increase in the fertility rate from 1.7 in 1998 to 2.0 in 2018. Another possible solution to the problem of ageing populations is by raising the retirement age. This would allow older workers to remain in the workforce and continue to contribute to society. In many countries, the retirement age is either statutory or contractual, but there has been a growing movement to extend this age and push it back to accommodate for the ageing workforce. In recent years, countries such as Japan and the United States have increased their retirement ages to 65 and 67, respectively. Lastly, improving healthcare is critical to meeting the healthcare burden associated with ageing populations. Healthcare systems need to be equipped with the necessary infrastructure, healthcare facilities, and healthcare professionals to cater to the needs of the elderly and provide quality healthcare. Governments can invest in building more hospitals and aged care facilities, provide tax incentives to healthcare professionals to encourage them to work in this field, and allocate more funds towards developing new technologies to improve the quality of healthcare services.\nIn conclusion, addressing the problem of ageing populations is a complex issue that requires multiple solutions. While immigration is a viable option, it comes with its own set of problems, and other solutions such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, and improving healthcare systems need to be considered alongside immigration.

France provides a good example of a country that has implemented such policies, with the state providing subsidies of up to 80% of the cost of childcare for working mothers of children under the age of three. Additionally, the state also offers long maternity and paternity leave and generous child allowances, all designed to boost the population. Another option would be to raise the retirement age, as the issue of a shrinking labour force is inextricably linked to an ageing population. For this to be effective, it is important that the elderly who are able and willing to work should be given opportunities to do so, such as through training and re-skilling programs that could enable them to enter or remain in the workforce. This would not only improve their economic well-being, but could also contribute to intergenerational harmony by reducing the burden on the younger generation to support the elderly. Lastly, improving healthcare would be another crucial policy to address the challenges posed by an ageing population. This includes investing in research and innovation to develop treatments for age-related diseases and conditions, and providing the infrastructure and services needed to care for the elderly in a dignified and compassionate manner. Investment in these areas could not only improve the quality of life for the elderly, but also reduce the strain on the healthcare system as a whole.\nIn conclusion, while the issue of population ageing is indeed a daunting one, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Immigration is an option that can alleviate some of the negative effects of population ageing, but it is not a comprehensive solution, and can result in problems of its own such as labour issues and social tensions.

It also brutally exposes certain contradictions, hypocrisies and errors which public figures make, in ways that mainstream news stations cannot do. In an extreme case, actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen acted as fake interviewers in \"documentaries\" like \"The Ali G Show\" and \"Who Is America?\" to coax politicians out of their scripted messages.

In another episode, he convinces gun lobbyists in the US to support arming children as young as three years old. The use of comedy and satire in these cases show that humour can play a significant role in society in making news entertaining and accessible to people and even in some cases, more accurate.\nNonetheless, there is a time and place for everything and there are certainly occasions where humour ought to play a limited role, or no role at all. In extremely serious and solemn situations such as funerals and court cases, there is not much place for humour. Humour isalsoof little to no value when it is used inappropriately or insensitively.

It should be used to uplift and put people at ease, not tear them down or add to their existing struggles.\nIn conclusion, the impact of humour cannot be understated. It helps create connections and alleviate tension between people of different backgrounds, ages and political persuasions. It also makes education and news more relatable. That said, we must also be cognizant to use humour in the right way and not cause further offense or damage.

As a result, they have become a popular way for people to consume news and political commentary.\nHowever, it is important to recognize that not all forms of humour are harmless. The use of derogatory jokes and slurs can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and marginalize certain groups. In fact, comedy has once been called a \"weapon of the weak\", a way for oppressed people to turn the tables and mock their oppressors. Yet in modern society, where it is easy to offend someone with a joke or remark, it is important to use humour responsibly and respectfully.\nIn conclusion, humour is an integral part of our communications and plays a significant role in our lives. It is a source of entertainment and relaxation and can be used to break up tense or tedious situations. Additionally, it can be used to educate and inform people in an engaging way.

There is a thin line between humour and offensiveness, and different people have different thresholds for what they find funny or inappropriate. In recent years, we have seen controversies over comedians, such as Louis CK and Dave Chappelle, using racially charged jokes in their acts. While some defend them as pushing boundaries and challenging social norms, others find their jokes distasteful and insensitive. In addition to this, humour can also be used as a tool for bullying and degrading others. The prevalence of cyberbullying is a clear example of how humour can easily be taken too far and become hurtful. As such, it is important to be mindful of the type of humour we use and who our audience is, to ensure that our jokes do not cause harm.\n\nIn conclusion, humour is an important aspect of our lives and can bring value in various ways. It can help us relax, provide us with a common language, and even be used for effective communication and education. However, it is essential to remember that not everyone appreciates the same type of humour, and we need to be careful not to cross the line into offensiveness or bullying. Thus, we should strive to maintain a balance between humour and sensitivity, using it as a tool to bring people together and lift them up rather than tearing them down.",

While it can be used to great effect in many situations, it can just as easily be used to hurt, offend or render people insensitive to serious issues. Stand-up comedians, for example, have long pushed the boundaries of what is considered good taste for a joke, often to the point where audiences and critics alike have accused them of being insensitive or downright cruel. The use of racist, sexist or homophobic language for comedic effect is also a source of tension and debate within and outside of the comedy industry. Moreover, humour in the workplace can also be a source of contention. While it can help to lighten the mood, it can also be a way for those in positions of power to assert dominance over their employees through joking in a manner deemed harmless by them.\nIn conclusion, humour clearly plays a very important role in our daily lives in Singaporean society. It can provide us with entertainment and relaxation, as well as educate us on important issues.

This is especially true for humour that is insensitive or inappropriate, such as making jokes about someone's physical appearance or personal struggles. In those cases, humour can be more damaging than helpful, leading to hurtful and unnecessary comments that could potentially hurt the person's mental and emotional well-being.

            "human_gen_truncate": "outdoors and for those who live in remote region. Although the plan to promote self-empowered education was promising, on hindsight, there were many doubts that arose regarding the development of the initiative in rural areas. For example, in Peru, over 800,000 low-cost laptops were distributed to children, but the direct benefits were not felt due to a myriad of problems, from ill-prepared rural teachers who were unable to fathom, much less teach, with the machines; software bugs that were not fixed affecting the learning; to the lack of electricity in the rural areas and schools to power the laptops. These concerns mar the alluring prospect that technology could potentially eliminate the problem of poverty, and highlight the importance of addressing the other issues that exist on the fringe of the main issue of poverty, such as providing basic infrastructure reassessing the government.\nAs aforementioned, the quality of the government has to be assessed before tackling the problem of poverty, as the reality is that the existence of corruption within most bureaucracies of developing countries makes the elimination of poverty an intimidating task. A country led by inept leaders generally suffers from greater instability and has poorly developed infrastructure. Under their governance, there is mismanagement of resources, resulting in poor and inadequate public services such as healthcare and education, which are vital aspects for a country'sdevelopment. In addition, even if technology were to assist in providing aid in times of need via social media platforms and the Internet, the donations and resources channelled from developed countries to the developing countries might not directly help the poor who need them the most. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, a significant proportion of food, medical, and monetary aid failed to reach the victims of the disaster as the Indonesian military looted the essential supplies to sell them in the black market at inflated prices, while the government pocketed the money. The ineffectiveness of technology in eradicating poverty is further reiterated here, what aid offered to poorer countries can be siphoned by the leaders to improve their wealth and status. Therefore, apart from technology, a call for action is certainly required in this instance, to exterminate corruption and put in place proper policies to ensure that aid is rendered to the poor, lest the impoverished be mired further in poverty.\nNext, international alliance and collective will play a major role in improving the current state of poverty. Various governmental and non-governmental organisations at national and community levels can work in tandem to tackle some of the major issues faced by the poor, such as healthcare concerns, and the lack of basic education, as these will eventually go a long way in assisting them to secure jobs, equipped with skills and also in the pink of health. Furthermore, by providing the poor with basic necessities, they would be able to utilize technology appropriately and to its fullest capabilities. UNICEF has been building national capacities for primarily healthcare. Around 270 million children, just over 14% of all children in developing countries have no access to healthcare services. As such, a global leader in vaccine supply, UNICEF purchases and helps distribute vaccines to over 40% of children in developing countries. It has also provided oral rehydration salts for 10 cents per packet to children suffering from dehydration. This two-pronged approach in engaging government aid families is still adopted by UNICEF today, reducing child mortality for those under 5, by almost 50% to date. Initiates to promote education have also been taken as they are key signifiers of positive economic development. The MacArthur Foundation, the Mastercard Foundation and the Human Dignity Foundation are collaborating through partnership in strengthening Innovative Practice in secondary education, issuing a second call for proposals to support lifelong learning opportunities and life skills for underserved youth between the ages of 12 and 19 in East Africa, Nigeria, and India. It is an indisputable fact that in the long run, education would serve well in providing people with better economic opportunities, higher agricultural productivity and cultural thinking skills to help them revenge their current plight and escape the straitjacket of poverty. Clearly, such measures would stand poverty-stricken people in good stead and enhance their quality of life, making it far more effective solution to the problem of global poverty.\nWith all of the above in mind, it must be noted that ever since its use to prominence in the early 20thcentury, technology has been a key aspect in our day-to-day lives, strengthening communications, and bringing work productivity to levels unparalleled in the last century. While technological developments have indeed contributed to mitigating poverty to some extent, the presence of other factors such as corrupt governments and lack of basic education and infrastructure impedes its progress in making a profound difference in the lives of the poor. As such, technology alone cannot be the only solution to the problem of global poverty, because if the root causes of poverty are not addressed, technology can and will only play second fiddle to the battle of poverty. What the poor require is not the complete removal of technology from their lives, nor is it the bombardment of technology in their society. They need to be exposed to technology at a gradual pace, along with other complementary external aid and reform actions, such as increased education and communication in the government. Essentially, a more calibrated approach towards tackling the problem would produce a desired outcome in the decades to come.",

Digital payment systems, such as mobile money and electronic benefit transfers, have enabled cash transfer programs, providing economic support to families, elderly people, and other vulnerable groups. The use of biometric identification systems has also helped ensure program integrity, reducing fraud and improving targeting. Additionally, technology has enabled the creation of monitoring and evaluation systems, enabling governments and organizations to track program performance and measure impact.\n\nDespite the potential of technology, however, it is not the complete solution to ending global poverty. There are numerous challenges that need to be addressed for technology to be effective in poverty eradication. One of the key challenges is the digital divide, which refers to the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not. Many people in developing countries lack access to technology due to factors such as cost, infrastructure, and digital literacy. This limits their ability to benefit from the opportunities offered by technology, perpetuating poverty.\n\nAnother challenge facing technology in poverty eradication is the issue of inequality. While technology has the potential to reduce poverty by creating new opportunities, it can also exacerbate inequality by creating winners and losers. For instance, those who lack the skills or resources to capitalize on new opportunities offered by technology risk falling behind, while those who are better equipped to take advantage of technology gain a competitive edge. This can further widen the gap between the rich and poor, and undermine efforts to reduce poverty.\n\nIn conclusion, technology offers immense potential in the fight against global poverty. It can enable economic growth, improve health and education outcomes, and create effective social safety nets. However, it is not the complete solution to ending poverty, as it is constrained by challenges such as the digital divide and inequality.

Technology has enabled these children to be exposed to the same educational resources that students from urban areas of developed countries have access to, presenting opportunities for a better future. However, similar to the previous point, the introduction of technology through initiatives like One Laptop per Child campaign is not a catch-all solution to the problem of global poverty. Such projects would still be impeded by other causal factors such as lack of basic infrastructure like electricity or even basic literacy to use the gadgets.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has the potential to contribute towards combating the issue of global phenomenon, it is limited by several macro and micro factors that prevent its effects from being maximised. It should be borne in mind that technology is not a substitute for proactive policies, education and good governance, which together constitute vital measures in effectively resolving issues of poverty.

With the integration of technology, online education has become the norm, where learners are not limited to traditional brick-and-mortar classrooms, and they have no need to spend time travelling to their learning environments. As a result, learners from poorer communities can do their own self-learning online at their own pace, reducing the cost of education. However, providing access to technology is not enough, as many of these communities lack the skills needed to effectively use them, hampering their potential benefits in curbing poverty. This highlights the need to also provide education or training to ensure that such resources can be utilized to their fullest potential.\nIn conclusion, while technology may seem to be the solution to global poverty, its utility is subjective and must be weighed against other factors. Greater consideration should be placed on the environment and control factors, such as better governance and education, to ensure that technology can be utilized to its full potential in lifting people out of poverty. Technology should be used to complement other approaches to solving the problem of poverty, rather than being the sole solution. With this multi-pronged approach, we can address the complexities of global poverty from all angles, ensuring that the poor have access to essential amenities and future promising prospects for better lives.",

It has also been noted that by giving access to technology for the youth of these areas, it will help to break the cycle of poverty as it provides them with a wider range of job and educational opportunities. However, it is important to note that access to the internet is still limited among the world's poorest, with close to 3.6 billion people still not having access to it. Moreover, the implementation of these initiatives may be hindered by local politics and social issues, such as cultural differences between developed and developing countries, as well as religious barriers towards certain types of technology. Therefore, it can be seen that although technology has helped to alleviate global poverty, more needs to be done to fully maximise its potential.\nIn conclusion, technology has brought about numerous benefits in addressing the problem of global poverty, but it is not without its limitations. As pointed out earlier, it would be prudent to examine poverty from a multi-pronged approach, where technology, governance, education and other factors are taken into consideration. While technology has the potential to enable greater access to basic necessities, it must be implemented in a way that is sustainable and accessible to the majority of the world's poorest. Increasing technological advancements such as genetic modification and social media connectivity have further proved that technology is indeed useful in tackling global issues, including poverty. Nevertheless, it is still important to recognise the various challenges that come with it and work towards effective solutions if technology is to truly wield its \"magic\" in transforming the world.",

It is hence crucial for governments to provide the necessary resources to enhance accessibility of such advancements to all strata of society.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that technology has the potential to improve the living conditions of the poor and combat global poverty. Nevertheless, while it is a powerful tool, it is not a panacea; its effects are limited by factors such as governance, education and lack of resources. Thus, in order to tackle global poverty, a multi-prong approach involving governance and humanitarian aid has to be taken, with technology as a secondary aid to these approaches, rather than being relied on as a one-stop solution to the issue.",

The advantages that technology brings about should not be overlooked. However, such advances need to go hand-in-hand with the proper education and sustainable governance, as well as efforts to eradicate corruption, in order to be effective and truly take root in the lives of the impoverished.

Not everyone has access or the resources to own a personal computer, internet or smartphone. This could potentially widen the disparity between the rich and poor, as the poor continue to be unable to access vital information or be employed in highly technical jobs. In addition, there are also issues of corruption in the allocation and distribution of aid. Sometimes, donors' funds are squandered by greedy officials or find their way to the hands of the rich, instead of the intended beneficiaries of the aid programme. Hence, the issues mentioned above must be addressed before technology can fully benefit the poor.\nIn conclusion, while technology has brought about many benefits and has the potential to aid in the fight against global poverty, it is not without its limitations. To ensure the holistic growth of a nation, it is important to consider a multi-pronged approach that includes promoting good governance and education, which will, in turn, help the poor utilize the benefits of new technology. At the same time, local and international authorities must be vigilant to prevent any abuse of power or lack of competence among government officials that may lead to a misallocation of resources. If these measures are put in place, then technology can indeed work its \"magic\" and truly assist in alleviating the problem of global poverty.",

Therefore, despite the significant impact technology has on aiding poverty, it is evident that there needs to be a more comprehensive approach in addressing the root causes of poverty, as well as to acknowledge the limitations of technology as a solitary solution. \n\nIn conclusion, technology undeniably has the potential to serve as a solution to global poverty, but its implementation is often more complicated than it would seem. Governments, NGOs and private entities should not rely solely on technology to address poverty, as there are limitations to its effectiveness in various contexts. A more holistic approach to addressing poverty, one that seeks to address social and economic issues, with the aid of technological advancements, is necessary to tackle poverty effectively. At a fundamental level, investing in grassroots-level education and creating opportunities for economic mobility may be key to solving poverty. In this way, synergies may be created to yield greater impact in the fight against poverty.",

Despite the potential of this campaign to bridge the gap between the rich and poor in terms of education, it has yet to be fully realised as not all countries are equipped with the necessary infrastructure to make use of such technologies.\nWhile technological advancements have certainly increased access to basic necessities and help to raise awareness about poverty, they are not a silver bullet to completely eradicate poverty. Factors such as poor governance and lack of education remain major stumbling blocks to making poverty a thing of the past. The poverty trap that persists in many less developed countries is not something that can be instantly solved through technological advancements alone. It requires political and social will, and improvement in access to basic necessities like healthcare and education, as well as the creation of jobs that provide a livable wage. These essential building blocks will help ensure that the poor will receive better care, and that their lives will be better equipped to reach their full potential.\nIn conclusion, technology certainly has made an impact in tackling the problem of poverty, by providing impoverished communities access to basic necessities and opportunities to learn and connect. However, its potential is limited by a variety of factors, and it should not be the only solution used to combat poverty.

In Germany, millions of dollars are pumped into vocational training annually, which the majority of post-secondary students pursue instead of university degrees. As a result, they are equipped with the experience and practical skills desired by employers, and this has helped keep youth unemployment at bay at 7% as compared to other European countries with an average of 40%, as of 2015. Therefore, it is not completely accurate to claim that formal education has not done enough to help students become ready for today'seconomic challenges, because one must take into account the fact that formal education is similarly evolving to adapt to these challenges.\nFurthermore, in light of the increasing racial and religious divides present throughout the world today, formal education is in fact doing its part in minimizing or at least, reducing, these divisions in culturally diverse societies. Most educational systems considers the holistic development of students in all levels of education, implementing various programmes and encouraging students to take up extra-curricular activities. At the elementary level, the Child Development Project (CDP) is a programme spanning multiple states in America, which aims to foster children'sethical, social and intellectual development. Reports have shown that students in CDP schools are more skilled at resolving interpersonal conflicts and engage in more pro-social behaviour. Additionally, extra-curricular activities such as sports, performing arts or community clubs not only help build resilience and resourcefulness, but also help inculcate soft skills such as teamwork amongst students as well, which are definitely vital for surviving in an economy that no longer guarantees job security. However, a more important purpose of these programmes is that they help foster social integration, as students gain a sense of pride and belonging to their community and its people. They also become more tolerant of citizens who are racially, ethnically or religiously different from themselves, which play a part in reducing the alienation of the minority. This is especially important in today'sdangerous world, where terrorism has spread in a large pan due to the isolation of misunderstood or stereotyped communities. These programmes are a part of formal education, and thus it cannot be claimed that formal education has done little to ready the students for today'ssocial challenges as well.\nTo conclude, there is a certain truth to claims that some traditional formal education that focuses only on educating students knowledge have become outdated, and hence irrelevant in readying students for the current globalized world plagued with uncertainty and threat. However, there are other aspects of formal education in several societies \u2013 from the elementary to university levels \u2013 that have also evolved to tackle these social and economic challenges and have revealed considerably encouraging outcomes.

The ability to manifest emotional intelligence, resilience, and a sense of personal responsibility, while critical, is often missing from formal education systems.\n\nHowever, there is a glimmer of hope. While formal education may have its limitations, it is only one facet of a vast range of educational opportunities. In the contemporary world, individuals with access to digital platforms and the internet can access a wealth of educational resources from several sources that can help bridge the gap in their formal education.

In school, students learn to work with others, build relationships and networks, and navigate social dynamics in preparation for future workplaces where soft skills like these are crucial. The chance to develop these interpersonal skills in a supervised and supportive environment may be less available in workplaces, where the costs of mistakes are often higher. Therefore, academic environments are essential for preparing graduates for future employment, especially those operating in increasingly complex and diverse settings. With formal education, students also have access to knowledgeable instructors who are experienced in their fields and can use their insights to inspire them to think creatively and critically.\nIn conclusion, while the current education system does face significant challenges like an oversupply of graduates and inadequate skills development, it remains crucial in providing a foundation for individuals to develop interpersonal capabilities, understanding of the changing global economy and opportunities for exploration.

There is still much that formal education can improve, but to claim that it has failed to keep up with the times is a myopic view that overlooks the complexity and progress made in adapting to the changing needs of society and individuals. \n\nAnother criticism against formal education is that it does not teach skills and attributes that are valuable beyond the workplace. Critics claim that the emphasis placed on standardized tests and high grades, combined with a disjointed curriculum that focuses mainly on academic performance, stifles creativity, critical thinking, and personal growth. The lack of opportunities for experiential learning or exploration of diverse interests can also limit the development of social and emotional intelligence, which are increasingly recognized as important characteristics for personal and professional success in the current era. These concerns are valid, but such criticisms are not a reflection of inherent failures within formal education as a whole, and rather should be taken as areas for improvement. Formal education can only be effective in developing well-rounded individuals if it prioritizes access to diverse experiences and promotes holistic development instead of having a singular focus on academic performance. \n\nIn conclusion, the role of formal education in preparing individuals for the challenges of the world has come under great scrutiny, particularly in the face of an evolving global economy and increasing competition. While there are certainly areas for improvement, it is unfair to assert that formal education has failed to adapt to changing societal and individual needs. The ongoing efforts to diversify curricula and provide more personalized and experiential learning, as seen in countries like Singapore and Germany, show that formal education is an evolving entity that continues to adapt to the ever-changing needs of society.",

Furthermore, the internet has allowed for more accessible and flexible learning through Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), where traditional university courses are available for free online, democratizing education. In essence, formal education has not only kept up with the changes of the global economy, but has also innovated to remain relevant and accessible, providing students with the tools necessary to adapt to the increasing competition in the workforce.\nIt is also important to note that formal education serves a key function beyond simply preparing students for the job market. Education equips individuals with critical thinking, problem-solving and communication skills that are valuable irrespective of the job or future path. Formal education provides socialization, teaching students how to interact with others from different backgrounds, cultures and beliefs, preparing them for civic life and to be active participants of society. Education also encourages people to explore their creativity, to develop a sense of curiosity and exploration and to be lifelong learners. By doing so, education makes individuals more empathetic, tolerant, and ultimately, better citizens.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that formal education has a significant role to play in preparing students for the challenges of an ever-changing world, both in terms of job preparation and citizenship. While there are certainly challenges and criticisms that have arisen, it is important to recognize the multitude of initiatives and innovations that have been undertaken to address these issues. Ultimately, it is up to the students to make the most of their formal education by taking advantage of the opportunities presented to them, and by recognizing the broader value and importance of education beyond just the acquisition of credentials."

            "human_gen_truncate": "ially important in a global economy that is gradually shifting from industrialization to more knowledge-based production. Moreover, having a society which is open to diversity attracts the investments of large multinational companies since it means that they are able to send in their professional expats much more easily. This explains why today'smost prosperous cities such as London, Singapore and New York are so welcoming to immigrants. Hence, since the trend towards diversity is what will drive future economic development in the world, it is a positive development.\nOn a more microscopic note, diversity in industries meaning competition as opposed to a single monopoly, is healthy. Competition drives producers to deliver better products and services and keep costs down. The liberalization of telecommunications in Singapore, for example, served to include Starhub and M1 together with Singtel. This move was to the ultimate benefit of consumers who received more choice and better quality. Therefore, diversity in industries improves efficiency in economies and is a positive development.\nAt first glance, one might think that the trend towards diversity in societies is beneficial because the cultural interactions between people can promote a greater understanding and respect between people of different races and religion. Indeed, the shift from ethnocentrism and stereotypes to a more global and multicultural society is a step in the right direction. However, it will be too optimistic to claim that everyone has understood one another and everyone is living harmoniously together. The influx of foreign cultures and values have alarmed cultural preservationists, leading to tensions and conflicts within societies. Radical Hindus, in India for example, have felt that western public displays of affection are unacceptable to traditional Indian culture so they annually harass or even attempt to forcefully marry young couples on Valentine'sDay. The French Law that bans headscarves and face veils in schools has also alienated many of France'sfive million Muslims. A few years back, rioting broke out in a Paris suburb when a police officer checked the identity papers of a fully veiled women. Indeed, social diversity brings about its own set of challenges and these problems are not easily solved. Therefore, while diversity may increase cultural understanding, the social strife it might cause does not make the trend towards diversity a necessarily positive one.\nIn essence, the movement towards diversity may be beneficial politically and economically but the social aspect needs to be examined more closely. Governments will have to embrace diversity but at the same time remain cautious at its negative aspects if they were to truly enjoy the fruits that diversity bear.",

The trend towards diversity can result in conflicts and misunderstandings. People from different backgrounds may hold different values, beliefs, and attitudes, which can lead to disagreements that may escalate to hostility and division. Furthermore, a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding can exacerbate conflicts. For example, a caricature of a Prophet can lead to tensions among religious groups. Misunderstanding of cultural norms can also lead to conflicts such as wearing headscarves or any form of cultural dress.\n\nIn addition, diversity can lead to the marginalization of certain groups. In a diverse society, some groups may dominate others, leading to an imbalance of power and privilege. For example, in some countries, foreigners or minorities may experience discrimination in the workplace. It must be acknowledged that diversity is not a panacea for addressing societal inequalities entirely.\n\nNotwithstanding, the drawbacks of diversity can be minimized if addressed properly. Sensitivity training, cultural awareness programs, and policies promoting inclusivity can make interactions among diverse groups more positive, productive, and meaningful. Effective communication and empathy techniques can be incorporated into these programs to foster understanding among individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, governments can provide policies that protect minority groups and promote their equality and access to opportunities. \n\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity is a positive development. The benefits of diversity, such as inclusivity, equity, personal growth, and development, creativity, and innovation, make it an essential component of modern society. However, we must acknowledge that diversity can also result in conflicts, misunderstandings, and marginalization and take necessary measures to mitigate those effects.

Hence, the rise of diversity and creative thinking is a positive development.\nHowever, diversity also presents challenges to society. One significant issue is the potential for clashes between different cultures and beliefs. The more diverse a population is, the more likely there will be misunderstandings, cultural clashes, and possibly discrimination. For example, in Singapore, ethnic tensions flared up in the 1964 race riots that had to be quelled through the imposition of martial law. That is why there are initiatives in Singapore now to promote racial harmony, such as the annual Racial Harmony Day in schools and the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles, which aim to build bridges between different races and religions. Besides, there have been concerns that having too many foreign workers in Singapore may lead to opposition against them. While Singaporeans are generally welcoming of foreigners who are willing to integrate into society, they are less willing to accept people who come to Singapore with no intention of assimilating or even disrespecting the country.\nIn conclusion, diversity is a positive development that can lead to creativity, better decision-making in politics and workplaces, and a broader appreciation for different cultures and beliefs. Nevertheless, diversity can also pose challenges, including misunderstandings, cultural clashes, and discrimination, that society must be ready to address.

The world today is facing numerous complicated issues in climate change, technological development, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, terrorism and global governance, so bringing together people from diverse backgrounds who can provide varying perspectives is essential.\n\nHowever, diversity does come with its challenges. One of them being the potential for miscommunication, misunderstandings, and tensions. People from different backgrounds may have different communication styles, values, and norms which can lead to conflicts. For instance, cultural misunderstandings can arise when people from different backgrounds are unaware of one another's beliefs and practices. This can result in stereotyping, prejudice, and even racism if not handled properly. Another issue is that of a lack of shared identity. When people come from different backgrounds, there may be a lack of common cultural experiences that can bond them together. Therefore, it becomes important for people to work to build a shared identity, which might require individuals to learn about the different cultures and values of the people around them.\n\nIn conclusion, diversity is a trend that is gaining increasing importance in today's world. While there are challenges to diversity, such as miscommunication, multiculturalism, and a lack of shared identity, the potential benefits of diversity far outweigh the costs.

Disagreements can escalate into conflicts, particularly when individuals feel like they are being attacked or their cultural identities are threatened. This can lead to a fracturing of relationships and a breakdown of communication. There is also the possibility of discrimination and bias against certain groups, which can further fracture relationships and cause individuals to feel marginalized.

Furthermore, a team that has been exposed to diverse perspectives is more likely to be able to adapt to changing circumstances and therefore stay competitive in the long run. Therefore, it can be argued that diversity plays a crucial role in promoting creativity and innovation. \n\nHowever, diversity also brings about its own set of challenges. For instance, communication can prove difficult when people from different backgrounds speak different languages or have different cultural norms. This can result in misunderstandings which may impact work productivity and lead to unnecessary conflict. Additionally, people may feel more comfortable working with those from their own culture and may be more resistant to change when it comes to integrating with colleagues from other cultures. Such difficulties can be minimized if there is an effort made to promote cultural understanding and respect in the workplace. At the same time, this can also be seen as an opportunity for individuals to broaden their perspectives and learn from one another. \n\nIn conclusion, while diversity does come with its own set of challenges, it is ultimately a positive development for society. Being exposed to people from different backgrounds helps us become better global citizens and broadens our perspectives on the world.

In this way, diversity can help drive excellence and progress across all fields of human endeavor.\n\nHowever, despite these benefits, diversity does have its downsides. One major challenge posed by diversity is communication difficulties, which can lead to misunderstanding and conflict. When people from different cultures come together, there may be differences in language, norms, and values that can make it difficult to work together effectively. Such misunderstandings can lead to miscommunication and personal conflicts which, if not resolved, may cause social disruption. For instance, different cultural attitudes towards time and punctuality may lead to difficult situations when managing projects and deadlines.

A lack of diversity in the workforce may cause 'groupthink' to occur. This is when a group makes faulty decisions because group pressures lead to a deterioration of \"mental efficiency, reality testing, and moral judgment\". However, when people with different perspectives, experiences and expertise work together, they challenge each other and provide each other with new insights and perspectives which may not have been possible alone. This is where creativity can thrive as different ideas and approaches are synthesized to create something that has never been done before. And when companies innovate and stay ahead, it is the customer that ultimately benefits. Therefore, the trend towards diversity in the workplace has led to more innovation and creativity and we should celebrate this diversity rather than just tolerate it.\nHowever, while diversity may lead to innovation, it may also cause some unintended consequences. Sometimes, when groups of people with different racial or religious backgrounds live together, it may lead to an 'us versus them' mentality. This has been seen in many countries where racial tensions exist between different ethnic groups. This is why some advocate for the need to acknowledge and celebrate diversity while still maintaining a shared sense of identity as a country or community. The key is not to ignore the differences between people, but to recognize and respect them while finding a common ground that brings people together. Therefore, diversity, while largely positive, has to be managed in a way that both acknowledges and respects differences while recognizing and celebrating the commonalities that bring people together.\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity is largely a positive development, but we must also be aware of its potential downsides. There is no doubt that diversity allows for greater exchange of ideas, creation of innovation and dislodging of the status quo. However, we must also be aware of the potential for 'us versus them' mentality and work towards creating a shared sense of identity that acknowledges and respects differences while also finding common ground.

For example, cultural misunderstandings or language barriers can lead to miscommunication, making it difficult for individuals to work together effectively. This can lead to tension and conflict, which may ultimately hinder progress. Additionally, stereotypes and prejudices can also create barriers that hinder effective collaboration. For instance, if someone believes that individuals from a certain race or gender are not capable of contributing meaningfully to a project, they may be less likely to listen to their ideas or take them seriously. This can potentially limit the scope of the project and ultimately hinder its success.\nIn conclusion, while diversity can bring about many benefits, it is important to remember that it is not without its challenges. Effective management of diversity is key to achieving the full extent of its potential benefits.

This is particularly advantageous in a world where change is accelerating so quickly that innovation is key. Therefore, diversity can help cultivate fresh ideas, thus promoting creative growth.\nHowever, despite its many benefits, diversity can present challenges as well. When different people come together, there can be conflict if they do not share the same values or beliefs. This can lead to misunderstanding, lack of communication, and ultimately, stalemates or even physical violence. The recent rise of nationalism is an excellent example of the negative effects diversity can have where people are often ill-informed about another country or culture they believe they have the right to interact with. In extreme circumstances, this sort of attitude can give rise to discriminatory policies or, in the worst cases, genocide. Intolerance can also manifest the kind of pressure difference in views may put on individuals, leading to stress and anxiety. Even in the workplace, diverse teams may struggle to find common ground, leading to delays or impediments in completing tasks. Therefore, while diversity can exponentially improve creativity and communication, it can be challenging if not managed correctly.\nIn conclusion, diversity is a frequently overlooked feature.

This may lead to a change in many designs, building houses and commercial buildings shorter to prevent collapse, or using new, stronger materials in the building process.\nFurthermore, buildings of the future should be built to be as eco-friendly and sustainable as possible. Incorporating solar panels into the roofs and sides of buildings and creating systems where water is reused for a variety of purposes are currently underway. However, more can be done to increase the effectiveness of these systems, such as designing buildings to capture maximum sunlight, or incorporating localised water purification and collection plants, so that water can constantly be reused and recycled. Designers may even consider incorporating ways of collecting wind energy, placing these turbines at higher floors to capture large amounts of wind. These efforts to encourage sustainable living will gradually help to reduce our carbon footprint, hence restricting our impact on the environment, and reducing the negative impact of global warming.\nFinally, the rise of greying populations worldwide as well as growing urban populations means that cities of the future have to be built with greater inclusiveness for those with disabilities, as well as the elderly. The building of cities that incorporate the needs of the disabilities involve minor structural inclusions such as ramps and lifts to allow those in wheelchairs to move around easily, or even making doors slightly translucent, so that the deaf will be able to determine if someone is behind a door, before opening it. Although these are already present in some buildings, they need to be incorporated into all cities and spaces. Designers should be able to anticipate the needs of the people that will be living in the cities, and those with disabilities should not be overlooked. Cities of the future will need to have signs in Braille for the blind, larger walkways so that the deaf are able to walk side-by-side and sign to each other at the same time. Current cities are only being built to cater to 99% of the population, but we need to remember that the 1% is a crucial part of our communities and societies as well. Similarly, with our growing elderly population, urban designs should provide areas with high elderly populations, more hospitals and palliative care centres should be built, to cope with the greater demand for them. There have been trials in Europe merging childcare and eldercare centres, and this has been proven to be beneficial in the mental wellness of the elderly, as social interaction lowers the risk of dementia and depression. The merger and incorporation of these seemingly different facilities is indeed radical, but has proven to be beneficial to the most overlooked segments of urban cities today.

            "prompt": "\"ENTERTAINMENT, NOT TRUTH, IS THE PRIORITY OF THE MEDIA TODAY,\" COMMENT.",
            "human_gen_truncate": "ut the Yemeni humanitarian crisis. Clearly, para-journalists pay little heed to more important issues in their bid to feed the insatiable need of their audience for entertainment and gossip. Against the backdrop of a parliament flailing in the face of Brexit, tabloids like the Daily Express have instead chosen to cover Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and her many controversies, even touting her as \"Duchess Difficult\". Are these media sources at least accurate in their reporting (never mind their obsession with covering the glitzy and glamorous) or do they compromise the truth in their pursuit of pleasure? It appears that tabloids often pay lip-service to the notion of truth \u2013 the feud narrative between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton has been thoroughly debunked by Buckingham Palace, and rumours about her being difficult with staff have not been verified with empirical evidence. It appears that parajournalism is a form of media which has taken its desire for entertaining material to the extreme, and completely forsaken the truth in the process. Unlike mainstream media, which often pushes a political agenda to further their own interests, para-journalists simply benefit from a readership that constantly desires entertainment. It would thus make sense for such forms of media to prioritize entertainment over telling the truth.\nFinally, I venture to argue that New Media, which refers to interactive digital media that incorporates two-way communication, tends to prioritise telling the truth over the amusement of its readership. Whether it successfully does so is another question. Alternative media like Wikipedia and Wikileaks for instance, have presenting the truth at the heart of what they do. Wikipedia allows its curious readership to discover the truth about a wide range of topics under the sun, whereas Wikileaks publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources with the intention of challenging narratives peddled by mainstream media. Evidently, rather than creating a fictional narrative that is meant to amuse, alternative media prefers to challenge conventional narratives with the intention of eventually uncovering the truth. This is because Wikipedia profits off telling the truth as users who trust its reliability and believe in its purpose donate an amount of USD $15 on average. That being said, social media platforms, which are also included under the umbrella term of \"New Media\", are also in danger of compromising the truth for entertainment. The nature of social media platforms and their business model means that algorithms pick up on the preferences of individual users, and thereafter promote articles or advertisements that it believes these individual users are inclined towards. This extends towards other issues in the public sphere when algorithms used by social media platforms contribute to confirmation bias; users are fed articles that reaffirm their existing views, which to a certain extent reaffirms them and brings about pleasure, be it in the form of self-righteous anger or otherwise. 47% of Conservatives are likely to see Facebook posts aligned to their own views, according to a Pews Research report. Again, as mediums under the umbrella term of \"New Media\" are so diverse in their motivations, whether New Media prioritises the truth over entertainment depends on how these motivations fit into their business model and align themselves with the profit incentive.\nIn a world where large media platforms seem increasingly obsessed with the hilarity of the trivial, and increasingly eager to broadcast their interest, it may appear that entertainment value has displaced the truth as a priority of the media. I venture to argue, however, that media networks are diverse and like individuals, cannot be tarred with the same brush. Their priorities are predicated on the priorities of their readership and their priorities as profit-generating businesses; if the public desires entertainment over truth, this is what the media will provide, for after all, we get the media that we deserve.",

Consequently, media outlets resort to sensationalizing news to attract more viewers, prioritizing entertainment over the truth.\n\nMoreover, social media has played a significant role in the prioritization of entertainment over truth in the media. News no longer needs to be factual to grab the attention of the audience. People tend to share exciting or controversial news stories on social media platforms without any fact-checking, and the news goes viral. As a result, media outlets prioritize producing sensational and clickbait news to amass large followings on social media platforms.\n\nDespite the above-discussed issues, some media outlets still uphold the principles of journalism and prioritize truth over entertainment. These news organizations operate with a core objective of providing reliable and factual news to the public without any biases. They respect the journalistic ethics and integrity and strive to hold accountable those who deviate from it. However, such outlets often have fewer viewers and generate lower revenues as compared with entertainment-oriented news media.\n\nIn conclusion, the media has indeed prioritized entertainment over truth in recent years. The reason for this shift is multifaceted, ranging from competition, reliance on revenue from advertisements, social media, and the unwillingness of audiences to consume news that is not sensationalized. However, it is crucial that we recognize and address this issue since it affects the growth and sustainability of any society. The media should reevaluate its core principles and ensure that truth is back at the heart of journalism. Only then can the media regain its credibility and fulfill its primary responsibility of serving society, ensuring transparency and accountability.",

                "ut the Rohingya crisis. This form of para-journalism is ultimately less about informing people than it is about providing a quick fix for their emotions. This type of para-journalism is arguably more harmful because it purposefully hides the truth and leads readers to form erroneous opinions about complex issues.\n\nFinally, New Media, which includes digital media portals and social media platforms, appears to prioritize entertainment even more over the truth. This is because New Media is often unregulated and anyone can post news, regardless of its validity. As a result, clickbait titles and sensational headlines are used to generate clicks and views. A perfect example is fake news, which has generated a lot of buzz globally, in particular in political arenas. This type of media prioritizes entertainment over truth because sensational and shocking news has a greater potential to go viral and generate views, regardless of whether it accurately represents the truth. However, at the same time, New Media is also the platform where investigative journalism and news that do not fit in with mainstream media agendas are reported. Indeed, alternative news portals like the Intercept and the Guardian are only able to continue doing their work thanks to a new media business model that prioritises viewer traffic over advertising revenue. Therefore, although New Media may bring along with it a greater potential for sensationalism and fake news, it is also home to a more diverse set of voices that do not toe a mainstream media line.\n\nIn conclusion, the media is a complex entity, and it is a gross oversimplification to assign a single priority to it. While mainstream media and para-journalism may be guilty of pushing entertainment over the truth, New Media provides hope that the media in general is capable of catering to its audience interests as well as to a broader societal responsibility to bring about the truth. Ultimately, the media will always reflect larger societal trends, and as long as society is more interested in entertainment than the truth, the media will continue to follow suit.",
                "ut the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. It is unlikely that para-journalists who cover such stories have any interests in the truth of the matter at hand, but rather they simply seek to attract readership by any means necessary. In this case, it is the curious readership who wants to read up on the glamorous lawyer and her fashion choice, and the fact that it is tangentially related to a human rights issue merely serves as a hook. Para-journalism lacks the seriousness of mainstream media, and is often not taken seriously by most readers except by the small niche communities they cater to. \nLastly, the New Media, which refers to the digital forms of media which have emerged recently, has a broader scope than mainstream media and para-journalism. It prioritises the needs of its diverse audience, which includes the desire for both entertainment and the truth. The emergence of citizen journalism is one manifestation of this trend. Social media platforms are important sources of information about current events and can serve to highlight unpopular views, giving a voice to the marginalised. However, while it is arguably the most democratic form of media, New Media can also be the most dangerous precisely because of its lack of regulation and professional standards. Anyone with an internet connection can and does produce \"news\", and dissemination occurs at an incredible rate. The speed and disruptive power of New Media is both a big plus and a disadvantage, in the sense that it increases access to information and amplifies civic engagement, but it also undermines authoritative sources of news and affords equal platform to credible and sensational content. Addressing the balance between entertainment and public interest in the realm of New Media therefore becomes particularly crucial.\nIn conclusion, while there is some truth to the idea that media has skewed towards entertainment at the expense of truthful reporting, the relationship between the two is not simple or one-dimensional. Ultimately, all forms of media have to balance profit-making with journalistic responsibility, and this is no easy task. Perhaps the greatest responsibility thus lies with the consumers, to take care in verifying sources and to be aware of the potential biases of each media outlet, instead of simply accepting blindly what is presented to them.",
                "ut genocide in the Sudanese region of Darfur in 2017. Such a focus on personal attire seems distant from the serious and impactful nature of the legal proceedings. Para-journalism sources also frequently publish articles that only present one-sided views, driven by the opinions and biases of individual reporters rather than an objective evaluation of all sides of an issue. This is done precisely to garner emotions and clicks, leading to greater revenue. As such, para-journalism is largely about entertainment, with little concern for bringing the truth to the public.\nFinally, the newer phenomenon of New Media, which refers to the online mediums for news, information and entertainment, provides a more nuanced interpretation. In line with the trends of online viewing, New Media sources prioritise online visibility - think clickbaits - over other forms of media. As online popularity is directly linked to revenue, New Media sources may present a wider range of interests and concerns, such as comedy or sports, alongside public interest affairs. Instead of relying on standardised \"templates\" of news coverage like mainstream media or the heavy emphasis of opinions like para-journalism, New Media sources have minimal restrictions on the particular inclination of the news published. As such, while New Media sources undeniably use entertaining angles to present public affairs, they do so in a manner that is reflective of the interests of the public as well, thereby making them less guilty of prioritising entertainment or the truth over each other. Nonetheless, the demise of online credibility due to the rise of \"fake news\" is a cause for concern and remains an issue to be addressed. \nThus, it is clear that media is not a homogenous collective, and its various forms have different priorities. While mainstream media is not immune to degradation of the truth, media sources continue to espouse ideals of journalistic integrity and are not always so simplistic as to be labelled as mere \"public entertainment\". Para-journalism, however, is much more guilty of prioritising entertainment over the truth. New Media, on the other hand, may use entertainment angles to present public affairs, but they do so in a manner that caters to the interests of the public while realising the need for credibility. Ultimately, the elephant in the room seems to be the financial stability of news sources. Until and unless this issue is addressed, the balance between entertainment and the truth will remain precarious at best.",
                "ut genocide. This sensationalist and irrelevant news is characteristic of para-journalism. It is clear that such reporting is motivated by the objective of generating profit through the sale of sensationalist news, which in turn targets a readership that prioritises entertainment over truth or public affairs. However, while para-journalism places more emphasis on entertainment, it does not necessarily mean that it compromises the truth. It simply means that the truth is not their priority. The stories they report are often accurate; it is the subject matter itself that is less substantial.\n\nIt is interesting to note that the New Media, while having little traditional frameworks, possesses a unique set of incentives and constraints. New Media sources like BuzzFeed, Vice, and social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter have been accused of prioritizing entertainment at the expense of truth. Buzzfeed is notorious for its \"listicle\" format, quizzes, cat videos, and sensationalist headlines. This kind of content has gone viral because it appeals to the public's insatiable appetite for entertainment. However, New Media sources are also capable of prioritizing truth. \"Crowdsourcing\", or the pooling of citizen journalism, allowed people to come together as a group and report on news events. During the Ukraine crisis in 2014, users of social media sites like Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit were able to collectively report and provide continuous coverage of the events that traditional media was not able to cover. This situation facilitated the spreading and sharing of accurate information in a way that relied on the power of individuals instead of large media corporations.\n\nIn conclusion, media cannot be reduced to a simple dichotomy between entertainment and truth. Mainstream media has agendas that prioritise both entertainment and the truth depending on how it fits into their objectives. Para-journalism prioritises entertainment but often reports accurately. New Media has the capacity to prioritize the truth but may also prioritise entertainment. It is therefore important to be discerning of media, and not blindly accept everything that is reported, and to read and support media sources that are balanced, nuanced, and considered in their reporting.",
                "ut genocide in Iraq by tabloids like Daily Mail, all while her crucial legal work was relegated to a footnote. This type of para-journalism is often seen as unprofessional and is subject to criticism for sensationalising and trivialising issues that are of public importance. It is not so much that these para-journalistic sources are concealing the truth, as much as they are not concerned with the truth, except insofar that it helps sell their publications. Therefore, para-journalism sources tend to prioritise entertainment over the truth.\nNew Media, which refers to digital media comprising websites, mobile applications, blogs, and social media platforms, has arisen as a new player in the media landscape. New media is often perceived as a refreshing alternative to mainstream media, more likely to prioritise the truth in their bid to gain a following with trust in their brand, rather than entertainment. In fact, the greatest advantage of new media platforms is their ability to communicate the truth in an accessible, yet nuanced way that resonates with its demographic. The New York Times' dialectic podcast \"The Daily\" or independent media outlet, The Middle Ground's coverage of major news pieces in Singapore are some examples of the viability of new media to produce engaging content in the service of truth. However, because these new media sources depend on their audience to generate income, this means that they prioritise the needs and desires of their demographic over the truth. Extreme right-wing sources, like Breitbart News, that deliberately fan the flames of division and use conspiracy theories to gain attention and revenue are perfect examples of how new media can take advantage of their audience's desire for novelty and affirmation. In other words, new media sources are not necessarily immune to entertainment and profit pressures either.\nIn conclusion, the idea that the media either prioritises entertainment or truth is somewhat of an oversimplification. It would be more accurate to say that different forms of media place a different amount of emphasis on entertainment or truth based on the media source's agenda, audience, and revenue flow. The only way to ensure that a proper balance is struck between truth and entertainment in media is for media consumers to critically evaluate their sources of news and for media companies to recognise the importance of a well-informed public in a democratic society.",
                "ut the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria(ISIS) in 2017 by tabloids such as TMZ and Daily Mail. This is an example of how para-journalism prioritises amusement over public interest. The priorities of para-journalists, who tend to package news as celebrities, events and features meant to delight or satisfy readers, hardly coincide with those of the mainstream media which is to uncover the truth. Because para-journalism is specifically tailored to a demographic that wants to be entertained, and because para-journalists are not hindered by professional and ethical concerns of traditional journalism, they are able to flout journalistic standards to maintain and even expand viewership. As such, para-journalism prioritises entertainment over the truth to a greater extent and must be viewed as an entirely separate entity from mainstream media.\nNew Media sources, which include social networking sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, are a new phenomenon which facilitates the ability to share news articles and stories much more easily. The priorities of New Media appear to be different from that of mainstream media and para-journalism in that New Media platforms do not possess the infrastructure to generate content. Instead, it functions asa platform for content to be shared freely; this means that users can share stories of events that mainstream media might ignore. Additionally, since most New Media sources are not dependent on advertisement revenue, they are not swayed by the whims of their viewing public. Facebook is an example of one such platform that raises questions about the nature of how news is disseminated. Facebook's lack of editorial policy opens up the possibility of news reports of suspect credibility to get shared and further propagated as truth. In this sense, the priority of New Media appears to be truth with a degree of recklessness thrown into the mix.\nIn conclusion, the media is not a homogenous collective, and the priorities of the media cannot be reduced to a simple dichotomy between entertainment and the truth. The priorities of the media are both diverse and influenced by the medium, target audience and platform in which they are presented.",
                "ut the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar, rather than for her work as a lawyer. This is a prime example of how para-journalism prioritises entertainment and sensationalism over the truth. Para-journalism is also known for pushing an agenda that might not necessarily reflect the whole truth. For instance, the issue of climate change is often covered with extreme bias by para-journalists, many of whom are funded by oil and gas companies with vested interests in maintaining their profits. In this case, entertainment is used to push an agenda that does not accurately reflect the truth of the matter.\nNew media, which refers to digital media that can be accessed through an internet connection, challenges our conventional understanding of media priorities altogether. New media platforms such as social media offer a space where anyone can become the media, and where truth and entertainment are less easily distinguished. The focus of these platforms tends to lie in getting \"likes\" and views, which drives the amount of traffic they receive. New media platforms such as TikTok are filled with entertaining videos, both harmless and harmful in content. However, new media cannot be painted with a broad brush as not all content is harmless and entertaining. User-generated content on social media can play a crucial role in creating awareness on social issues that mainstream media ignores, with #MeToo being a prime example. Disadvantaged groups, such as African Americans, use Twitter to voice out opinions, concerns and stories of discrimination that mainstream media does not afford them. In this sense, new media rivals the idea of para-journalism as it pushes a genuine agenda for social justice. Nonetheless, new media can still suffer from the same shortcomings of mainstream media and para-journalism insofar as it can also be driven by an agenda that prioritises entertainment over truth.\nIn conclusion, while it is easy to assume that media sources are preoccupied with entertainment over truth, it is more accurate to say that media outlets tend to prioritise an agenda, which can either prioritise entertainment or truth depending on how it fits with that agenda. The media is not monolithic, and our understanding of its priorities should reflect this diversity.",

These tabloids have thus pushed their agenda almost completely towards the production of entertaining articles for the public\u2019s consumption, and indeed they make a good deal of money off this approach.\nLastly, New Media, which covers all forms of media they obtained through the internet, is much harder to definitively place in this dichotomy. Ironically, New Media itself is a very broad term, encompassing everything from individual blogs to dedicated news sites, and even traditional media sources that have developed an online presence. For instance, The Straits Times, which we previously analysed as a mainstream media source, also possesses a substantial online presence. YouTube-based news channels like Vox.com and Philip DeFranco have also become increasingly popular, with excellent use of infographics and animations, the latter of which is known for its segments with catchy and entertaining titles such as \u201cWhy Starbucks Failed In Australia\u201d. On the other hand, individual YouTubers and bloggers are known for their candid and sometimes graphic recounts of their personal lives, with little regard for the truth, and have unapologetically invited their viewers into the spectacle of their own existence.\nIn conclusion, the priorities of media sources are highly dependent on the type of media at hand; mainstream media is motivated by profit and a commitment to the truth, with entertainment taking a role based on how it fits into the priorities of the media outlet, while para-journalism welcomes sensationalism, and seeks primarily to entertain. New Media is diverse and difficult to categorise, and so its priorities will be diverse as well. Ultimately, it is up to the audience to determine what is most important to them in a news source.",
                "ut human rights abuses in the Maldives, which demonstrates the growing trend of para-journalism to prioritise sensationalism over news that strictly concerns the public. This has implications for our understanding of current affairs because para-journalism has a tendency to colour news in a particular light or slant, which removes objectivity from the equation entirely. It is not difficult to see how para-journalism can then be weaponised by entities with vested interests in order to shape public opinion and disrupt democratic processes. \n\nFinally, there is the New Media, which refers to all forms of media that have emerged or evolved since the advent of widespread access to the internet, including blogs, social media, and mobile applications. As a product of the internet age, the New Media has a very different set of priorities than the former forms of media. Unlike mainstream media and para-journalism, which rely on advertisement revenues or major political affiliations, the New Media largely relies on user-generated views and clicks, which in turn generates revenue through advertisements or user donations. This creates a unique relationship between the New Media and its audience, one in which the New Media seeks to be the desired destination for those audiences, with entertainment of one form or another playing a critical role in this goal. It's easy to see how click-bait headlines and sensational images can tempt users to engage with the New Media source. However, the New Media can also use this same logic to bring the truth to light in its reporting, by providing a platform to new or marginalised voices that have been lost or overlooked by mainstream sources. Sites like Bellingcat and Wikipedia, made possible by the internet age, are examples of how the New Media can provide a platform for unfiltered truth-telling. \n\nIn conclusion, it is important for us to recognise that there is no single media agenda that dominates. Different forms of media have different motivations and priorities that shape how they interact with their audiences. It is our role as citizens of a democratic society to be discerning of the multiple messages and read beneath the surface of what is being reported. We must question the value of what is being peddled as \"truth\" or \"entertainment\", because the line between them is often a blurry one. Ultimately, it is a reminder that we must remain vigilant in our desires for information and content, so that we can best discern what is truly in our public interest.",
                "ut war crimes. Such coverage is indicative of para-journalism's tendency towards sensationalism and a focus on entertainment rather than public interest. It is understandable, considering that para-journalism operates on a different logic from mainstream media. Unlike mainstream media, para-journalism does not have the resources to engage in investigative journalism and providing accurate facts. Consequently, para-journalism often relies on an individual writer's opinions and speculations, which often results in crudely sensationalised accounts of worldly events. Indeed, the readership of para-journalism is not invested in the pursuit of truth or objective information; instead, they may simply seek entertainment. \n\nNew Media, which refers to digital technologies such as social media and online platforms that allow for the distribution of information, occupies a unique position in that it allows anyone or any group to produce and disseminate information and is less beholden to the profit logic of mainstream media and para-journalism. However, this has given rise to a proliferation of fake news and post-truth claims, which threaten the very foundations of democracies and trusted journalism. In general, New Media seems to demonstrate a higher commitment towards entertainment and sensationalism rather than truth. The aim of New Media is not always to provide for the public interest, but to generate online traffic and gain advertisement revenue. As such, New Media outlets may resort to clickbaiting articles with misleading headlines in order to capture the interest of internet users. This can be seen in the proliferation of tabloid-style celebrity gossip sites, content farms that produce articles based on search engine trends, and social media influencers who produce content that aims to generate likes, comments and shares. While New Media offers a breadth and diversity of information, the lack of gatekeepers or mechanisms for quality control has led to a growing public distrust of online media's ability to provide accurate and reliable information.\n\nIn conclusion, media sources often face competing pressures and interests, from generating profits to appealing to consumer desires. While all three forms of media - mainstream media, para-journalism and New Media - may prioritise entertainment over truth at times, it is not always the case. It is important to remain vigilant in recognising media sources' agendas and to demand quality journalism focused on the public interest."

            "prompt": "\"THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF RELIGION DID NOT EXIST.\" WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "e earlier argument that religion promotes division and gives rise to a \"us versus them\" mentality needs to be balanced by the fact that religion plays an important role in our world today as a unifying force, creating to hold people together in communities where individuals feel safe, accepted and respected. Organized religions foster a deep sense of community among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people who hold similar values. Religious festivals such as Thaipusam, Hannukah, Easter and Hari Raya witness people coming together in a show of solidarity and community bonding. As a consequence, religion does provide a measure of civil order by nurturing a sense of belonging among people, which is far more desirable in preventing violence and conflict than societies with no central guiding principles save that of materialism and self-centredness. Indeed, many religions advocate practices that place helpful limitations on the behaviour of their adherents. Teachings such as the Ten Commandments in the Torah and the Bible, and the Middle Path in Buddhism, reject extremism and embrace moderation, leading many to view them as positive influences which potentially protect adherents from the destructive or even fatal excesses to which they might otherwise be susceptible. Many, if not all, religions promote peace, and the unfortunate fact that conflicts take place in the name of religion is more a reflection of how a minority of believers have misconstrued and distorted certain doctrines in their religions either out of misguided teachings or to serve their own narrow and selfish agendas. This is therefore an indication of our innate human nature rather than an indictment of religion as an institution in society. Hence, religion can and does serve a useful purpose in modern society in this aspect.\nIn addition to the role that religion plays in the areas of community identity and moral guidance, religion also has a cherished place in society because of the positive impacts which are manifested in practical and concrete ways. By championing the universality of humanity as a race with shared values, dignity and respect, religion often brings out the \"human\" side of mankind in the areas of charity, compassion and altruism for the betterment of humankind. The  2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami witnessed international aid coming from non-Muslim organizations like the Salvation Army in the well-intentioned provision of humanitarian aid; Christianity is noted for the founding of many missionary orphanages and schools; Buddhist welfare organizations are often at the helm providing food and medical supplies to the needy. In fact, the most well-known international humanitarian organizations \u2013 the Red Cross and the Red Crescent \u2013 were initially established as religious outfits to provide humanitarian aid and comfort in a suffering world. Offshoots of organized religion, such as A Rocha'sEcochurches in the United Kingdom, also lead efforts to promote conservation of the natural environment. Formal research also suggests that religion can be a force for good as it promotes a sense of engagement with the community. Research conducted by the Religious News Service suggest that religious people are three to four times more likely to engage in civic activism, be it volunteering with grassroots organisations or donating money to a selected social cause. In today'sworld which places great emphasis on profit-making, personal and corporate goals, selfish materialism, it can be argued that religion is more needed than ever to teach us to think and act beyond the narrow confines of our own comfortable worlds.\nBesides the positive functions of religion at the societal level, religion also meets many needs for the individual. Although much has been made about how religious faith is at odds with rational analysis, many famous thinkers and intellectuals actually found their way to God through the path of cognitive evaluation and rational analysis. Prominent figures such as C.S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, and Antony Flew have written extensively on how the teachings of religion most closely describe the realities of the world we live in, with both Lewis and Flew being staunch advocates of atheism before converting to Christianity after weighing the historical and intellectual evidence for the existence of God. Beyond cognitive reasoning, religion also taps into the emotional wellspring of our existence by providing deeply-satisfying emotional experiences. From the singing of traditional hymns to the practice of solitary meditation; from the trance-like states produced in such practices as the Whirling Dervishes to the graceful motions of yoga; believers of religion are able to find emotional relief and fulfilment by participating in such rituals and acts. But it is at the spiritual level that religion most attend to the needs of people. Through postulating a reality which includes both the natural and the supernatural, both the seen and the unseen; both the temporal and the eternal, religion helps man in his search for meaning and answers to life'sfundamental questions that science, technology and materialism have not been able to provide adequate answers. Why do we suffer? Why are we here? What happens after death? Such issues as the human condition, the purpose of human existence on earth, the afterlife, can only be answered by religion and faith in God that transcends our finite, material and physical existence,  providing hope in an eternal life. But even in this life, religion also fills a spiritual gap that gives believers strength and resilience in the difficult times. Abraham Maslow'sresearch after World War Two revealed that Holocaust survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs, suggesting it helped people cope in extreme circumstances. This was most famously enunciated in Viktor Frankel'smoving book entitled \"Man'sSearch for Meaning\", detailing his experience with the importance of religion in his survival of the concentration camps of the Holocaust. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, what shone through was that instead of renouncing religion bitterly, many turned to God for solace and comfort. As can be seen, in today'sworld wrought with conflict, disasters, and uncertainties, religion has not declined in relevance, but instead increased as it becomes embraced as a coping mechanism for people in their grief and despair.\nFinally, in our current frantic pace of life, religion provides an avenue for the fatigued and the frustrated. As a result of technology and globalization, a whole slew of health-related problems have emerged in modern society, with depression, stress and burnout being just a few of them. Many stressed-out individuals have been known to take time off from their hectic work schedules to be alone for reflection and contemplation, often turning to religion for respite. In Singapore, retreat centres such as the Catholic Spirituality Centre and the Maranatha Retreat are becoming increasingly popular among working adults who seek havens to rest, recharge and restore their personal ecologies in a world away from the everyday busy routine of life'sdemands and stresses. Catholic churches, Buddhist temples, Hindu temples are also witnessing more people entering their sacred sanctuaries during lunchtime on a workday or after work to pray and seek rest and comfort. Thus, religion can be said to provide a much needed stabilizing and calming effect in our society that is fast being deprived of assurance, direction and security.\nIn a world where the winds of globalization are blowing strong and the domination of science is growing deep, we desperately need religion as an anchor to provide a sense of identity and community and as a compass to guide us and offer navigation in the uncharted waters of new scientific discoveries. Granted, religion has been used to justify much tension, violence and human suffering but we do need to also acknowledge the many positive benefits it has brought to mankind both at the societal and individual levels. Getting rid of religion would not only fail to solve many of our current problems, but would remove a much-needed institution in a world increasingly fraught with fear and insecurity and marked by a culture of excess.",

In the Middle East, for example, Islam serves as the glue that holds communities together, irrespective of their political affiliations or economic status. Similarly, in India, Hinduism has been the foundation of cultural practices that transcend social divides, such as the caste system. Without religion, societies would be more fragmented and less cohesive.\n\nHowever, critics of religion argue that it has been the source of much violence and conflict around the world. Religion has been used to justify wars, genocide, and persecution. The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and the partition of India and Pakistan are just a few examples of the violent confrontations that have been fueled by religion. Furthermore, religious fundamentalism has been blamed for many terrorism incidents, such as the 9/11 attacks by Islamic extremists. All these incidents have tarnished the image of religion and led to much strife and human suffering.\n\nHowever, the root cause of such conflicts is not religion per se but rather the misinterpretation of religious teachings by fanatics. Religion itself espouses peace, compassion, and respect for one another, and it is the extremist\u2019s interpretation that creates violence. Furthermore, while many religions have been implicated in violent acts, it is important to recognize that religion is not the only source of conflict. Ideological, political, and economic differences have also been the source of many conflicts around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that the world would not be a better place without religion. Religion provides a spiritual dimension to people's lives, inspires humanitarian initiatives, and fosters social cohesion. While it is true that religion has been the source of conflict and violence, this is not a problem inherent to religion as an institution, but rather a consequence of extremists' misinterpretation of religious teachings. In sum, religion, in its pure form, has the potential to make the world a better place by providing meaning to life, fostering humanitarian initiatives, and promoting social cohesion.",

                "e benefits of religion are also manifold. Religion can unite people, providing a sense of community and a shared identity. The rituals and practices that are associated with religion can bring people together and foster a sense of belonging. This is especially important in today's fast-paced, globalised world where social interactions are becoming increasingly superficial. Religion can also provide a sense of purpose and meaning, and it can inspire people to work towards a better future. The various religious organisations often engage in charitable work, providing aid to the less fortunate. Religious institutions have also played an important role in shaping society, with religious leaders often being at the forefront of social and political movements. Religion has been pivotal in the fight for civil rights, with the likes of Martin Luther King Jr leading the charge. Similarly, religious organisations have been known to champion causes such as environmental protection and poverty reduction.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that religion has often been a source of conflict, and that it is not always compatible with modern secular ideals, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion is misguided. The benefits of religion are numerous, both to the individual and to society at large. Religion provides a moral compass, and it can inspire people to live better lives. It can also foster a sense of community and identity, and it has the potential to work towards a better future. While we must guard against the excesses of religion and ensure that it does not infringe on the human rights of individuals or create divisions, it would be a mistake to overlook the value of religion entirely. Rather than dismissing religion altogether, we should strive to find a balance between the demands of tradition and the needs of the modern world, and work towards harnessing the positive benefits of religion to create a better future for all.",
                "ere is also a strong argument to be made that religion plays an important role in bringing people together and fostering social cohesion. Across the world, there are countless examples of communities that are bound together by shared religious beliefs and practices. These communities provide individuals with a sense of belonging and identity, and can help to break down barriers between different ethnic, cultural and socio-economic groups. Religious institutions also carry out numerous charitable activities, from running soup kitchens and homeless shelters to providing aid to victims of natural disasters and conflicts. Religion thus provides a way for individuals to contribute to society and make a positive difference in the lives of others.\nMoreover, religion has a long and rich cultural history that has shaped human artistic expression, literature, architecture, music and more. From the grand cathedrals of Europe to the intricate calligraphy of Islamic art, religion has inspired some of the most beautiful and enduring creations of human civilization. Even secularists who have little interest in religion cannot deny the influential role it has played in shaping our cultural heritage.\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly valid concerns regarding the role of religion in society, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion is too simplistic and ignores the nuanced ways in which religion has shaped and benefited human civilization. While we must always remain vigilant against abuses of religious power, we should also recognize the many positive contributions that religion has made to individuals and society as a whole. Ultimately, the debate over the value of religion in a modern world is one that will continue to be fiercely contested, but it is one that is too important to be reduced to simplistic caricatures and ideological posturing.",
                "e positive impact of religion is also undeniable. Many religious organizations play a vital role in providing much-needed social services to underprivileged and marginalized communities. They channel resources to provide education, healthcare and other forms of assistance to the needy. Religious institutions also play a crucial role in fostering a sense of community and social cohesion. They provide a space for people to come together, and offer a sense of belonging and support, especially for those who feel isolated and disconnected from mainstream society. Furthermore, religions have been instrumental in promoting respect for diversity and tolerance. The Golden Rule, which can be found in all major religions, enjoins us to treat others as we ourselves would like to be treated. It is this fundamental belief in the dignity and worth of every individual that forms the basis of interfaith dialogue and cooperation, and which helps to promote mutual understanding and respect among different religious and ethnic groups. Without religion to act as a catalyst for social action, there would be fewer institutions truly devoted to serving others and promoting social harmony. \nIn conclusion, while there are undoubtedly valid criticisms that can be made of religion and the negative effects it can sometimes have on individuals and society, it is important to recognize that there are also many positive benefits that religion confers. In today's complex and rapidly-changing world, we need all the moral guidance and social support we can get, and religion can play a vital role in providing these. Rather than arguing for the elimination of religion from the public sphere, our focus should be on promoting interfaith dialogue, understanding, and cooperation so that religions can work together to promote the common good and create a better world for all.",
                "e role of religion cannot be underestimated in terms of its positive impact. Take for example the massive charitable work done by religious organizations the world over. From running soup kitchens for the poor, to building schools and hospitals in impoverished countries, the contribution of religious institutions to society is immeasurable. The holy pilgrimage for the faithful to Mecca is not just a religious rite, but a source of commerce for the entire region. More broadly, in secular societies like Singapore, religious harmony is a key tenet of social stability, enabling different religions to coexist in the same space. If not for religion, it is impossible to see how the differing beliefs and practices of different believers could be accommodated or reconciled. In Singapore, even though there are street-level conflicts between different races and religions, most religious leaders come together in official ceremonies to endorse inter-religious harmony. The fact that this is done in the name of religion is telling, and underscores the point that religion can be a powerful unifying force in society.\nIn conclusion, the claim that the world would be a better place if religion did not exist is too simplistic and fails to appreciate the multiple benefits of religion in society. While it is true that religion has often been a source of conflict, it is also a source of solace, comfort, moral guidance and hope for many millions of people. Further, religion plays a critical role in ensuring that advances in scientific research do not outstrip moral boundaries, while at the same time contributing significantly to social welfare and inter-religious harmony. As such, we should not be so quick to dismiss religion as irrelevant, but rather, we should be reminded of the many different roles religion continues to play in our world today.",
                "e role of religion is also paramount in promoting social cohesion and integration. In many countries, such as Lebanon and Nigeria, religious affiliations serve as the primary marker for individual identity and can be a source of communal pride. Religion can also be a source of charity and philanthropy, as evidenced by charitable donations by religious organizations and individuals following natural disasters and humanitarian crises. This has the positive effect of binding people from different walks of life under a common cause, and promoting solidarity. Additionally, religion has provided the impetus for some of the world's greatest works of art and architecture, such as the Taj Mahal and Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel. Such works reflect the elevation of the human spirit and the expression of man's deepest thoughts, feelings and longings. All these serve to enrich the cultural fabric of our society and are things that should not be casually disregarded or easily dismissed.\nIn conclusion, while it is easy to blame religion for the many societal problems that humanity has faced throughout the ages, it is not fair nor accurate to paint religion as the sole cause of conflict and discord. Religion certainly has its drawbacks and excesses, but it also has its benefits, and can act as a guiding force for the betterment of mankind. Given its prominent role in shaping human affairs over the course of history, it is unlikely that religion will disappear anytime soon. What is important is that we do not let our biases and prejudices interfere with the potential good that religion can do for society. Ultimately, the role of religion in our lives is a deeply personal one, and we must allow for the diversity of beliefs and traditions that constitute our humanity.",
                "e benefits of religion are also manifold. Religion has often functioned as a social glue that has held societies together, uniting various groups of people with shared values and beliefs. This is particularly true for developing countries where secular institutions may be weak or non-existent. Religious organizations, whether churches, mosques or temples, often play an outsized role in providing social services, education, healthcare and disaster relief. In the aftermath of natural disasters for instance, we often witness religious groups rushing in to offer aid and support to those affected. In the United States, faith-based organizations account for a significant portion of all nonprofit groups engaged in charitable works, such as caring for the homeless, providing food assistance and offering counseling to troubled families. Religion also provides a sense of meaning and purpose to people's lives, giving them a source of hope and motivation to face life's challenges. It can also serve as a reminder to people not to become too fixated on material possessions or money, something that is becoming increasingly relevant in today's consumerist, capitalist culture. Finally, religion can also serve to inspire art, music and literature, providing a rich cultural heritage that has enriched our lives in countless ways.\nIn conclusion, while there is no doubt that religion has often been the source of conflict, division and prejudice throughout history, this is not reason enough to dismiss it altogether. The many positive benefits that religion brings to individuals and societies should not be ignored or forgotten. In an increasingly complex and uncertain world, we need religion as much as ever to provide a moral compass, inspire us to lead lives of purpose and meaning, and enrich us with culture and art. Rather than rejecting religion outright, it is important that we continue to dialogue with different faiths and strive to find common ground and shared values for the betterment of all humanity.",
                "e view that the world would be a better place without religion is also a short-sighted one as it ignores the many benefits that religion brings to the community. By providing a strong sense of community and shared identity, religion has the power to bring people together, bridging divides of race, class and culture. The building of places of worship for people to come together to practise their faith creates a sense of belonging, as well as opportunities for social interaction, networking and mutual support. Religious communities often provide a safety net for the most vulnerable members of society, such as the poor, elderly and those in need of emotional or financial support. Examples of such organizations established by religious groups include the Salvation Army, St. Vincent de Paul and the Jewish Association for the Physically Disabled. Religion therefore has a unique capacity to foster a sense of social responsibility and provide a framework for the betterment of society as a whole.\nFurthermore, religion is often a force for positive change, even in the face of much societal opposition and highly entrenched beliefs. In the United States, the civil rights movement of the 1960s was heavily influenced by Christian principles of equality, non-violence and social justice, culminating in the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination on the grounds of race, color or religion. More recently, religious groups such as the Interfaith Network for the Syrian refugees, backed by Muslim, Christian and Jewish communities alike, have played a significant role in providing shelter, support, and hope for the countless refugees fleeing from the conflict in Syria. Without the commitment and collaboration of religious groups, these efforts would have been much harder to achieve. Thus, by serving as a bulwark against social injustice, religion can transcend individual differences, muster collective strength and become a potent force for social and political change.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that religion has often been a source of division and conflict, the suggestion that the world would be a better place without religion is overly simplistic. Rather, we should acknowledge and appreciate the wide-ranging benefits that religion brings to individuals and society, particularly in terms of moral guidance, social cohesion, and positive change. As such, the challenge lies not in abolishing religion altogether, but in finding ways to harness its positive potential and use it as a force for good in our increasingly complex and interconnected world.",
                "e role of religion also cannot be underestimated. Religion has often played a vital role in bringing people together and fostering a sense of community and belonging. Places of worship such as churches, temples and mosques act as important social centers, where individuals from all walks of life come together to worship and interact with one other. This is especially crucial in multi-racial and multi-religious societies like Singapore, where religion serves as a unifying force that cuts across racial and cultural boundaries. Furthermore, religious organizations frequently spearhead charitable and welfare programs, providing assistance and support for the less fortunate in society. These efforts help to alleviate social inequalities and provide much-needed aid to society's most vulnerable groups. On a macro level, religion has often been a driving force for social change and activism throughout history. This can be seen in the Civil Rights movement led by Martin Luther King Jr, who championed racial equality in the face of staunch opposition. The abolition of slavery in the British Empire was also achieved in large part due to the efforts of the influential Christian anti-slavery movement. These examples demonstrate the power of religion to unite people for a common cause and bring about positive social change.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that religion has been the cause of much conflict and strife throughout history, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion does not hold up under closer scrutiny. Religion provides individuals with a sense of meaning and purpose, offers moral guidance in a world that is increasingly complex and provides a critical voice that can act as a check against scientific progress that may be detrimental to humanity. Furthermore, religion plays a vital role in fostering community, providing aid and support to the less fortunate and driving social change. Ultimately, the role of religion in society may differ depending on one's personal beliefs and experiences, but it cannot be denied that it remains a significant force in shaping our world today.",
                "e role of religion cannot be underestimated. Religion has traditionally been a source of community identity and cohesion, and this remains true even in modern times. Religious organizations provide a space for people to connect with like-minded individuals, to share their beliefs and to participate in acts of charity and service. Many religious charities and organizations provide aid to the most vulnerable and destitute members of society, and many religious leaders advocate for social justice and human rights. In particular, the Catholic Church, through its social teachings, has been an advocate for protecting the poor and marginalized in society. Religious communities can also provide a sense of belonging and support during times of difficulty and crisis. Despite the flaws inherent in human nature and religion, it cannot be denied that religion has also played a significant role in promoting positive values of compassion, empathy, and social responsibility. Without this sense of shared identity and shared values, society may become fractured and divided, with individuals feeling untethered and disconnected. Religious traditions can act as a unifying force that promotes social cohesion and cooperation, which are necessary foundations for any peaceful and just society.\n\nIn conclusion, while religion has certainly been a source of conflict and division in human history, it is too simplistic to assert that the world would be a better place without religion. Religion has played and continues to play an important role in providing moral guidance, community cohesion, and social responsibility. While there are certainly flaws and shortcomings in the practice and interpretation of religion, it is ultimately up to individuals to reflect on their own beliefs and actions, and to strive towards creating a more tolerant, compassionate, and just world.",

Religion encourages people to care for the poor and those in need, and to treat others the way they would like to be treated. This is the common thread that runs through all religions, and is what makes it such an important force for social good. Beyond this, religion also provides a sense of community and belonging that is often missing in our society today. In a world that is becoming increasingly fragmented and individualistic, religion serves as a powerful antidote to this trend. It brings people together and fosters a sense of shared identity that is important for building strong and resilient communities. Additionally, religion plays a critical role in charity and social welfare.

This includes things like education, healthcare, and emergency relief. Without religion, many of these services would not exist or would be severely compromised.\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly many examples of religion being used to justify violence and intolerance, it would be shortsighted to argue that the world would be a better place without it. Religion plays an important role in our society, providing a moral and ethical framework that is essential to navigating the complex moral issues we face today. Beyond this, religion also provides social cohesion and community, and serves as a powerful force for good in areas such as charity and social welfare.

            "human_gen_truncate": "Liberia observed that recidivism rates for former mercenaries decreased when they were offered employment opportunities and resources Indeed, because economic gains often translate into less poverty and less desperation which then leads to greater social security, it can be argued that achieving economic gains should be a top priority for the government.\nHowever, despite the fact that economic gains do bring about a higher standard of living, more effective political governance and greater social stability, there is also a need to recognise that rapid economic growth can, and does, also generate certain negative side-effects that governments do well to take note of. Critics, for instance, highlight the fact that although Singapore has an impressive economic growth track record, it also has one of the world'shighest Gini coefficients, which is a figure that measures the income inequity levels of countries. The income disparity in Singapore is further accentuated by statistics which reveal that the bottom 10% of Singaporean households earn $570 a month, while the top 10% of Singaporeans earn $13,581 a month. Yet, while it is true that this wide gulf is partly caused by the Singapore government'sbreakneck pursuit of economic gains, it must also be noted that the government does recognize this issue and has channelled much of Singapore'sfinancial gains from past decades back to helping the needy and disadvantaged in recent years. A good example of this is how in the economic recession of 2008-2009, the Singapore government was able to dip into its reserves to draw S$4.9 billion to fund two extraordinary measures such as the Jobs Credit and a Special Risk-Sharing Initiative to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn.  Singapore'sBudgets of the last few years also have also kept the social needs and welfare of the people. The budget allocated to ministries such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth has increased by 100%, from $15 billion in 2009 to $30 billion in 2018. New schemes such as Careshield Life have been steadily introduced as their primary focus the social needs and welfare of the people, with billions of dollars being harnessed to fund community initiatives such as ComCare to help to address the diverse needs of Singapore the needy. In light of this, it can be argued that economic gains actually do lead indirectly to social stability as the monies generated provide the means to look after areas of society that the government is obliged to look into. Therefore, economic gains should be the main concern of the government, even as it acts to ensure that those who may not be benefiting from the economic gains are given the help and assistance that they require.\nOn another note, detractors of the position that economic gains should be the primary concern of the government opine that, more often than not, these economic gains come at the expense of the environment. When governments make industrialisation and modernisation a top priority, environmental concerns and conservation inevitably almost always become marginalised. A prime example of this would be India, which has enjoyed a GDP growth rate of 6 to 7% since 1991. Yet, although it has one of the world'shighest rates of economic growth, India is also notorious for the vast environmental damage that economic development has wrought within the country. As of 2019, 22 of the world's320 most polluted cities are found in India; and life expectancy has decreased by 2.6 years due to air pollution. The Ganges river is one of the most polluted in the world, and close to 640 000 die every year due to water pollution. Similarly, 40% of China'slakes and water sources are contaminated with chemicals from factories; numerous species of wildlife have become extinct, most notable among them being the Yangtze River Dolphin. But thankfully, in contrast, the situation in Singapore is more optimistic. While it cannot be denied that economic progress at times come at the cost of the environment, the Singapore government has assiduously worked hard to balance this tension between pursuing economic gains and pursuing environmental protection by using the financial gains it has amassed through sound economic policies to map out and implement strategies to ensure sustainable living within the country. For instance, since 2012, the Housing Development Board has rolled out a $31 million drive to install solar panels in 30 neighbourhoods, and it is currently in the process of turning its youngest townships such as Punggol, Bidadari and Tengah into real-time test beds for the newest energy-saving innovations. The Solar Energy Institute of Singapore is leading the research and development in the solar energy sector, with the support of the Economic Development Board and the National Research Foundation of Singapore, among others. Many of these initiatives to protect the environment can only come about because of the economic gains that the Singapore government has achieved for the country which then pave the way for these projects to be adopted.\nIn the final analysis, while we acknowledge that the government has a duty to look into legitimate concerns that economic gains can lead to undesirable consequences, it must also be recognized that governments must first and foremost ensure the economic viability of the countries they lead.  This is for the simple reason that without economic security being achieved in the first place, essential services cannot be provided. A strong argument can therefore be made for economic gains to be the main concern of the government, as this gives it the financial and political means to implement policies which address other aspects of society such as income inequity and environmental conservation, as the case of Singapore has adequately shown.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "economic growth has led to unsustainable levels of resource depletion, pollution, and climate change. In Singapore, our government has recognized the importance of environmental sustainability and has taken steps to protect our natural resources and reduce our carbon footprint. For example, we have invested heavily in public transport infrastructure to reduce reliance on private cars, and we have introduced various incentives to encourage businesses to adopt eco-friendly practices. These policies not only benefit the environment but also improve the quality of life for our citizens.\n\nFinally, cultural preservation is an important aspect of a government's responsibility to ensure the well-being of its citizens. In Singapore, where a diverse range of ethnicities and cultures coexist, it is crucial that the government preserves our unique heritage and traditions. Our government has implemented policies to promote the arts, protect historical landmarks, and preserve our national identity. These policies not only enrich our cultural heritage but also increase our sense of national pride and cohesion.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic gains are undoubtedly important, governments should not be solely concerned with them. Policies that prioritize economic growth at the cost of social welfare, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation are ultimately unsustainable and can lead to negative outcomes such as inequality, environmental degradation, and cultural erosion. Instead, governments should take a more holistic approach to policy-making, addressing the needs of all citizens and balancing economic gains with broader societal concerns. In my country, Singapore, the government has recognized the importance of pursuing a sustainable and inclusive development model, which has benefited both our economy and our society. This approach can serve as a model for other nations to follow, as they strive to balance economic growth with a wider range of concerns.",

                "Liberia found that economic gains played a significant role in rehabilitating former combatants and reducing the chances of re-recruitment into armed groups. The program provided participants with transfer payments, vocational training and start-up capital for small businesses, which ultimately led to more stable livelihoods. By extension, this also contributed to the maintenance of overall social stability. Therefore, it is clear that economic gains can directly and indirectly lead to social stability and security.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is crucial to be mindful of the potential unintended negative consequences of pursuing economic growth, the government's top priority should continue to be the pursuit of economic gains. The development of a country'seconomy ensures that the physical and material well-being of its people is taken care of, and it also leads to political and social stability. As a Singapore Junior College student, I recognize that the government's relentless focus on achieving sustained economic growth has enabled Singapore to achieve and maintain its status as a prosperous and stable nation, and I believe this path should be continued and reinforced.",
                "Nigeria found that the program's success depended on the availability of economic opportunities in the areas where ex-combatants returned. When a lack of economic opportunities persisted, the returning fighters were more likely to revert to violence and insecurity. Hence, it is clear that economic gains cannot be ignored as a key concern of government policies, as it plays an integral role in promoting social stability and reducing the risks of social unrest.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are legitimate concerns about the potential negative impacts of pursuing economic gains at all costs, it is undeniable that economic progress must remain a primary objective for any government if it is to ensure the well-being and stability of its citizens. The examples of Singapore, China and many other countries all demonstrate the potential benefits that come with a strong and growing economy, offering the opportunity for improved public amenities, infrastructure, and standards of living for its citizens. For these reasons, I firmly believe that a strong economy should be the primary concern of government policies.",
                "Sierra Leone noted that the most influential factor in decreasing recidivism rates among ex-combatants was the provision of gainful employment opportunities that enabled the former combatants to seek legal means of earning their livelihoods, rather than resort to criminal activities or acts of terror. Hence, it can be argued that economic gain should be the foremost goal of government policies as it directly leads to social stability by reducing poverty rates and thereby decreasing crime rates.\nIn conclusion, while it is essential that governments stay mindful of the potential downsides of pursuing economic growth such as income inequality and environmental degradation, it remains clear that economic gains should be the main concern of government policies. Without the foundation of an economically secure and prospering state, any potential pursuit of social justice and political openness becomes virtually impossible. On the other hand, a thriving economy leads to improved public amenities, infrastructure, social stability and political legitimacy - all factors that contribute to an overall better standard of living for the citizens of the country.",
                "Liberia found that the primary factor in reducing the likelihood of ex-combatants resorting to violence was the availability of economic opportunities, which provides these individuals with an alternative to going back to criminal activities or joining extremist organizations. \n\nFurthermore, economic gains also indirectly relate to social stability by providing a solid foundation for the implementation of social welfare policies. Governments are more likely to have the resources to develop more comprehensive and effective social programmes when the economy is performing well. For instance, Singapore's social programmes such as the SkillsFuture initiative, which helps Singaporeans upgrade their skills, and the Silver Support Scheme, which provides support for low-income elderly citizens, are funded by the government's healthy budgetary surpluses arising from a thriving economy. A strong economy also provides the government room to experiment with advanced technological solutions to help solve social problems such as healthcare, housing and transportation. \n\nIn conclusion, the measure of a civilised country is more than simply how it treats its weakest members, but this cannot be achieved without the country first attaining economic stability and prosperity. The government should therefore continue to prioritize economic gains as the primary concern of its policies, as seen in Singapore's and other thriving economies' relentless pursuit of economic progress. By doing so, we lay the foundation for a more stable, efficient, and forward-looking country, with social policies that can benefit all of its citizens.",

Economic growth will help to maintain the country's prosperity, increase political stability, and provide the citizens with a better standard of living and an increased sense of social security. Therefore, it is safe to say that economic growth should be the primary objective and the ultimate concern of government policy, resource allocation and decision-making.",
                "Sierra Leone, found that it was the increase in employment opportunities, and the promise of a better standard of living that motivated ex-militants to renounce violence and reintegrate into society. Hence, it is evident that economic gains should be the primary concern of government policies as these are crucial for creating social stability within the country, and reducing the potential for unrest in society.\nIn conclusion, the notion that economic gains should be the main concern of government policies is ultimately one that rests on the undeniable truth that the current state of a country's economy is one of the most fundamental pre-conditions upon which other policy initiatives can build. Without a thriving economy, neither welfare policies, long-term infrastructure plans, nor any other human needs can be effectively addressed. Once a government performs the crucial role of economic growth, it in turn leads to a more stable social and political environment, enabling the government to address other pressing issues that affect its citizens. Economic gains may not be the only responsibility of the government, but no other objective can be achieved without it. Hence, ensuring economic development is paramount for any government to meet the fundamental needs of its people.",

Therefore, a stable economy leads to a stable society.

Having these basic needs met, Singaporeans have little reason to feel disadvantaged economically or socially, ensuring a stable society in the current and for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while there certainly are valid arguments why economic gains should not be the be-all and end-all of government policies, I believe that a strong economy sets the foundation for all other objectives to be met, be it good governance or social stability. It is the panacea that allows a government to function in the best interest of its citizens. Therefore, while the government should not be blind to the potential side effects that come with economic growth, it should nevertheless prioritize a healthy economy as its main concern.",
                "Rwanda found that the most significant factor influencing the success of the programme was the level of economic growth experienced in the communities in question. In other words, the presence of economic opportunities acts as a deterrent towards the engagement in illicit activities that disrupt social stability. Furthermore, on an indirect level, economic gains can also be said to have a positive impact on social stability through the provision of better education and healthcare infrastructure, which makes for a healthier and more educated populace. As the writer Branko Milanovic has shown, economic growth is a necessary condition for the progress and reduction of poverty rates in the long-run. Hence, it is reasonable to conclude that economic gains, whatever their source, should be the foremost concern of government policies.\nOf course, some might argue that the pursuit of economic gains at the expense of other equally important issues such as environmental protection and income equality is a shortsighted approach. Income inequality might threaten social stability, while environmental degradation might threaten public health, resulting in long-term costs on the economy and society. While I do agree that these issues should not be ignored, the fact remains that these issues must first be viewed in the context of any country's economic viability. Only countries with a strong and growing economy can afford to undertake the challenges of preserving the environment and income equality. Moreover, it is not just about making economic gains, but how these gains can be used and redistributed to ameliorate these issues while ensuring that the economy, businesses and jobs are not adversely affected. In Singapore'scase, the government has been meticulous in ensuring that environmental policies and conservation are factored into its economic agenda. As Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has said in an interview with the Straits Times in 2017, the \"greatest challenge to Singapore's continued success is resources\", and that the need to \"balance the economic interests with long-term environmental sustainability is a constant effort.\" Similarly, in China, the government has implemented sustainable infrastructure projects and launched an \"ecological civilization programme\", which is aimed at promoting a greener, low-carbon development model. Hence, it is not that economic gains are necessarily at odds with care for the environment, but rather that it is a delicate balance between these two aspects that must be sought. \nIn sum, the measure of a civilised country is indeed how it treats its weakest members, but a prosperous and growing economy is a necessary precondition for any country to be able to address its social problems and protect its environment. Economic growth and stability facilitate the provision of amenities, resources, jobs and education that are essential for a good quality of life, and the absence of which is likely to lead to social and economic instability. As importance as environmental and income inequality concerns are, they too require a country to be economically stable to be able to afford their implementation. The question then is not whether economic gains should be the main concern of governments, but how these gains can be achieved and used to best benefit society.",
                "Sierra Leone observed that it had a positive impact on reducing crime rates and improving social stability in the country. Therefore, ensuring strong economic gains should be a key policy objective of government to promote social stability within the country.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the potential pitfalls of economic growth need to be acknowledged, and mitigation measures implemented accordingly, ultimately a strong and growing economy should be the main concern of any government. This is because only with a strong and growing economy can a government propose and implement effective policies, ensure political stability and social security, and create a high standard of living for its people. In short, a healthy economy is the bedrock upon which any good governance is built.",
                "Sierra Leone found that economic opportunities were a key factor in preventing ex-combatants from returning to violence. Without the stability that economic growth brings, there is little hope in building a cohesive and productive society.\nOn an indirect level, economic development has an even greater role to play in social stability as it allows for the government to enact social policies that can benefit a wide range of citizens, including those who are most in need. In contrast to countries with weak economies where there may be insufficient financial resources to adequately support social programs, a prosperous economy provides the government with the necessary leeway to expend resources on social goals such as universal healthcare, education and affordable housing. As Singapore has demonstrated through its own implementation of social programs such as the Community Development Councils and the Housing Development Board, these initiatives have far-reaching positive effects because they provide the necessary means for social mobility and lifelong learning, keeping the society harmonious and united.\nIn view of the above arguments, it is clear that economic gains should remain the priority objective for the government. While concerns such as issues of income inequality and environmental sustainability cannot be ignored, the necessary policies to address these concerns can only be implemented once there is a robust and growing economy that provides a secure foundation for all other social and governance goals to flourish. It is an undeniable fact that the measure of a successful country is how well it attends to all its members, but in the context of the Asia-Pacific region where Singapore exists, the measure of success often includes economic progress as well. In all, the government should seek a balanced approach that ensures economic well-being while addressing critical social issues in tandem, creating a win-win situation that ensures a secure and prosperous future for Singapore."

Such policies are necessary to ensure that our economic growth does not lead to the loss of our unique cultural identity.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic growth is important, it should not be the sole priority for government policies. Policies that address social welfare, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation are just as important and necessary for long-term development. In Singapore, our government has recognized this and implemented measures to ensure that we have a balanced approach towards development. It is important for other countries to do the same to ensure a sustainable and equitable future for all.",
                "economic growth has led to environmental degradation, climate change, and the depletion of natural resources. This is why policies that promote environmental sustainability are increasingly important. In Singapore, our government has recognized the importance of protecting the environment and has implemented various policies to reduce carbon emissions, promote recycling, and conserve our natural heritage. By prioritizing the environment, the government is not only protecting our planet for future generations, but also ensuring that economic growth can be sustained in the long run.\n\nFinally, cultural preservation is also an important consideration for government policies. Singapore is a multicultural society with a rich heritage and diverse traditions. As we continue to modernize and urbanize, there is a danger that our cultural heritage may be lost or forgotten. To prevent this from happening, the government has implemented various policies to promote cultural preservation, such as the preservation of historic buildings and monuments, the promotion of local cultural events, and the support of traditional arts and crafts. These policies help to foster a sense of national identity and pride, while also attracting tourists and promoting economic growth in the tourism industry.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic growth is important, it should not be the only priority for government policies. Other concerns, such as social welfare, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation, should also be taken into account. In Singapore, our government has recognized the importance of these issues and has implemented various policies to address them. By balancing economic growth with these other concerns, the government can ensure a more sustainable and equitable future for all Singaporeans."

            "prompt": "\"YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.\" IS THIS TRUE OF YOUR COUNTRY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "se of the financial sector, and research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis go as far as to suggest that these millennials might be unable to accumulate sufficient wealth for retirement. Younger millennials born in the 1990s and 2000s have to contend with economic uncertainties like the US-China trade war, the implications of climate change on supply chains, and rapid unprecedented rates of technological disruption to traditional industries. This is a vast contrast to the situation in Singapore'searly days of economic development in the 1960s and 1970s which saw the creation of large numbers of jobs in the rapidly growing manufacturing industry, and strong and sustained economic growth rates. Furthermore, with the winds of globalization blowing strong today, competition between economies has intensified, making it imperative for local employees to constantly upgrade themselves to ensure that they can continue to value-add to their companies in order to remain employed. Young people in Singapore today thus face greater pressure to remain competitive and employable, contrary to the perception that they lead smooth-sailing lives with their whole lives charted out for them.\nAdditionally, while young people today are generally more educated than past generations, the overall increase in education standards means that there are greater expectations to do well academically and it is even more difficult for one to stand out amongst a sea of university students, especially when 4 in 10 Singaporean youth will eventually be degree holders. Moreover, the influx of foreign talents in recent years has raised the bar for many graduates, making it more competitive in getting jobs. As a result, young people, despite being given more education opportunities, now face greater difficulty in getting their desired jobs, and often have to make do with jobs that do not match their qualifications or aspirations. A recent research study conducted by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute suggest a pernicious, worrying underbelly of underemployed millennial graduates, some of whom are earning less than $2,000 a month from their full-time jobs despite their education qualifications. This suggests that young people in Singapore may not necessarily be better off compared to past generations when we take into consideration the increasingly competitive and uncertain job landscape in which they have to survive and thrive in today.\nBesides, the steadily rising costs of living in Singapore is another reason that Singaporeans today may not enjoy an easier life compared to previous generations. Soaring Certificate of Entitlement (COE) for the purchase of motor vehicles and sky-rocketing property prices are but a few of the indicators of inflation. Singapore'sheadline inflation has gradually been on an upward trend, and the cost of purchasing a home or a car in Singapore far exceeds that in other countries. Increasingly, Singaporeans are finding themselves having to tighten their belts to cope with this. Although it is undeniably true that all Singaporeans, both young and old, are affected by the high living costs, young people are more likely to bear the brunt as costs continue to climb, which means they may have to work even harder and longer hours than their parents and grandparents. Today, young people in Singapore take on part-time jobs and freelance gigs such as driving for Grab or Gojek in order to supplement the income from their full-time job, and this presumably complements the observation that millennials in Singapore work 49 hours a week, with 1 out of 4 working two jobs at a time. As a consequence, health issues such as stress, fatigue and even depression could well ensue. In this sense, the higher standards of living that young Singaporeans enjoy today must be viewed in the light of the heavier financial burden imposed by rising living costs.\nIn our world which is increasingly fraught with fear, insecurity and uncertainty, the young are living in a Singapore that is beset with novel challenges that previous generations did not have to grapple with. As the famous historian R G Collingwood once said, \"every new generation must rewrite history in its own way\". In this light, when assessing this or any generation, both the positive and the challenging aspects must be taken into account. Therefore, notwithstanding the better education or job opportunities available to this generation, it would be inaccurate to say that the young in Singapore never had it good if we understand also the myriad issues surrounding today'sgeneration.",

Singapore has excellent public transportation, modern hospitals, world-class shopping centers, and parks, among other things. With low crime rates and a clean environment, we enjoy a high quality of life that is enviable to those living in other parts of the world.\n\nDespite these advantages, we must also acknowledge that not all young people in Singapore have equal access to these opportunities and privileges. Income inequality in Singapore is a persistent issue, and some young people may be unable to access the same resources as their more affluent peers. Education and technology may be available, but not everyone has the financial means to make the most of them. For example, not everyone has access to the latest devices and the internet at home, which can hamper learning and opportunities for self-improvement.\n\nFurthermore, mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety, are prevalent in our society, and young people are not immune to these challenges. The pressure to succeed, particularly in academics, can take a toll on a young person's mental health, and there may not be enough resources available to address these concerns. While mental health awareness has improved in recent years, more needs to be done to destigmatize these issues and provide accessible mental health support for all.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that young people in Singapore have never had it so good in certain aspects, there are still many challenges that we face as a generation. It is essential to recognize that not all young people have equal access to these opportunities, and society must work to level the playing field. As we continue to progress as a society, we must not lose sight of the issues that still need to be addressed and work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive environment for all.",

In Singapore, retrenchments and wage stagnation are realities for many young people, who, despite having a good education, find it difficult to secure a good job that will provide them with a comfortable standard of living. This puts them in a precarious financial position, especially when they are also carrying a significant amount of student debt. This economic climate has also led to the rise of the gig economy, where young people are being forced to piece together multiple jobs to earn a decent wage, often with little job security and benefits. \n\nFurthermore, the rapid pace of technological development that Singapore and the world are experiencing has also brought about new challenges for young people. The easy access to and reliance on social media and technology has led to a heightened sense of anxiety and a constant need for validation that can be difficult to manage. This has resulted in many young people feeling disconnected from reality and struggling to form relationships outside the digital realm. In addition, the prevalence of fake news and the blurring of lines between news and opinion on social media platforms have made it increasingly difficult for young people to access trustworthy news sources and form well-informed views on the world around them. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that Singaporean youth today enjoy a higher standard of living and greater access to education than previous generations, it is essential to recognize that our young people face their own unique set of challenges. These range from economic uncertainty, the pressures of social media, and the blurring of lines between news and opinion. These challenges require young people to develop resilience, adaptability, and critical thinking skills to navigate the world in which they live. Therefore, the notion that youth today have it easier than the generations before them is one-dimensional, and we must recognize that Singapore's young people face a new set of challenges that require a new set of skills to overcome.",

Moreover, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence has given rise to fears that many of today'sjobs may become obsolete in a few years' time and young people need to be adept at learning new skills and adapting quickly to the changing job climate. \n\nIn the social sphere, the rise of social media and the internet has given young people access to unprecedented amounts of information and connectivity. However, there are also downsides to this increased connectivity. Cyberbullying, social media addiction, and online radicalisation have become real risks that young people need to contend with. Moreover, the perpetuation of idealised beauty standards and the rise of cybercelebrities have made many young people feel the need to keep up with unrealistic standards of beauty and success, leading to issues with self-esteem and self-worth.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that young people in Singapore never had it so good fails to account for the complex set of challenges that they have to face in today's rapidly changing world. While it is true that young people today enjoy greater access to education, higher standards of living, and greater access to information, these advantages come with the added burden of dealing with economic uncertainty, job insecurity, increased connectivity, and unrealistic societal expectations. It is, therefore, essential that we acknowledge and work towards addressing these issues through better policies and increased social awareness.",

Those who graduated from university during this period would have experienced the full brunt of the uncertain job market as well as the aftermath of the Great Recession. Many were left overqualified and underpaid, and had to take up jobs that did not match their qualifications, all while grappling with the high cost of living in Singapore. This phenomenon of career stagnation and insecurity is pervasive across the world and has been coined \"jobless youth\" by the United Nations. A 2018 report by Deloitte showed that an overwhelming number of millennials (95%) express concerns that they might not be able to achieve the same standard of living as their parents, and this feeling of inequality has spurred many young people to demand for a fairer and more just society. \n\nIn the political arena, many young Singaporeans have also become more politically aware and are taking a stand on issues that are important to them. In 2018, the town council elections in Singapore saw an unprecedented level of youth participation. More than 80% of young voters aged 21 to 35 turned up at polling stations, demonstrating a desire to be heard and to shape the future of their hometown. Many young Singaporeans today also have a greater sense of social responsibility and are involved in various causes from climate activism to advocacy for human rights.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be true that young people today in Singapore have better access to education opportunities and higher standards of living, we must not overlook the fact that they face a different set of challenges and uncertainties. Economic insecurity, joblessness and political and social issues are pervasive and complex, and young people in Singapore today are not immune to these problems. Rather than dismissing the struggles of the younger generation, it is important to support and empower them, and to recognise their efforts in shaping a brighter future for Singapore.",

This situation has only been compounded by the rise of automation and artificial intelligence, which threatens to disrupt many traditional industries and displace a significant proportion of jobs. The rise of the gig economy and the increasing prevalence of contract work has also led to a loss of job security for many young people, exacerbating fears surrounding the economy.\n\nAnother set of challenges that young people in Singapore today face is in the area of politics and social change. The ascent of populist politics and the growing polarization of societies across the world has led to demands for social activism and greater political engagement amongst the young. This comes on top of the often-thought-of negative effects of social media, which can breed insecurity, social comparison and division amongst youth. Pressures to conform to societal expectations, such as getting a degree, securing a stable job, and settling down with a family can further exacerbate this situation. Combined, these challenges make navigating adolescence and adulthood a more complex and trying endeavour than ever before.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that young people in Singapore today have access to greater education opportunities and higher standards of living than their predecessors, they also face a range of challenges unique to their generation. These challenges manifest in the economic, political and societal domains, and cannot be dismissed as insignificant. Therefore, we must avoid labeling today's youth as \"strawberry\" or \"Generation Me\", and instead acknowledge and support them in their quest to carve out meaningful and fulfilling lives for themselves.",

The situation today is no less dire, with the COVID-19 pandemic causing an economic crisis and the heightened competition in the global market, making it increasingly difficult for young Singaporeans to secure employment opportunities. While the education system today provides a wider range of courses to cater for different talents, it does not necessarily translate to a better job market. Youth unemployment rates continue to be high despite the increased emphasis on skills training and apprenticeships. Job insecurity and underemployment remain concerns for many young Singaporeans today.\nSocial issues also persist in the current generation of young people in Singapore. Many Singaporeans view the prevalence of social media as both a blessing and a curse. Whilst it allows for greater communication, social media has also been observed to contribute to the rise of cyberbullying, negative self-image and addiction. The pressure of living up to the expectations portrayed on social media can also cause significant psychological distress. Moreover, issues such as mental health, gender and identity discrimination are also concerns that the younger generation have to contend with, which previous generations may not have experienced as intensely.\n\nIn conclusion, although the young people in Singapore today have access to a plethora of educational and material resources, they face a distinct set of challenges in a world that is constantly evolving. It is also important to note that material comforts do not necessarily equate to happiness or ease of life. It is, therefore, crucial to have a nuanced understanding of the situation and push for policies that adequately address the needs and challenges of young people, recognising the diversity within their experiences and circumstances.",

Forward-looking graduates are also facing intense competition in the job market brought about by digitalisation, automation and artificial intelligence. The speed of technological advancement in recent years has also brought about more precarious work arrangements and the so-called gig economy, which are characterised by short-term or freelance contracts with no job security and protections. These developments undoubtedly make life more challenging for young people in Singapore today, who have to navigate their way through increasingly complex and dynamic labour markets.\n\nSocially, young people today also face new challenges and pressures that have surfaced in a more open and interconnected world. Social media and instant messaging applications have become ubiquitous, allowing like-minded people to connect and forge communities easily online. However, the highly curated and manicured world of social media can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and exclusion for those who are unable to keep up with the perceived standards of beauty, success and happiness set by social media influencers. Cyberbullying, harassment and cybercrime also pose challenges to young people who are more digitally connected than ever before. Even in the political domain, young people are confronted with challenges that are unique to their generation. The rapid rise of right-wing and extremist tendencies globally underscores the importance of critical thinking, cultural understanding and moral values like empathy, tolerance and mutual respect. These are values that our young people should embrace more fervently, especially in a world that is becoming more heterogeneous and varied.\n\nIn conclusion, while it might be true that young people in Singapore today have access to better education opportunities and higher standards of living, the existence of new challenges and uncertainties has made it more difficult for them to thrive. In this light, it is imperative that we do not fall into complacency and recognise that the \"strawberry generation\" or \"Generation Me\" stereotype is more complex than simply being a product of a privileged and comfortable environment. Ultimately, we need to foster a culture of resilience, empathy and inclusivity that will enable our young people to overcome challenges and adapt to the rapid changes in today's world.",

In the face of these challenges, the younger generation has to grapple with the fact that they might not have the same quality of life as their parents. Singapore society also grapples with the widening income gap between the rich and the poor, resulting in an even greater challenge for youth from lower-income families to break out of their socio-economic circumstances.\nIn the social and political spheres, the current period is marked by heightened concerns over issues like climate change and diversity. For young people, these issues are pressing and demand action, while the lack of urgency elsewhere has been disheartening for many. The commitment of younger generations to causes such as climate-based activism and social justice movements reflect the heightened seriousness of these issues that they face. The increasing number of social and political movements led by young people are also indicative of enhanced engagement and involvement on social and political causes that matter to them, which suggests that the younger generation is not apathetic or entitled as some critics have alleged.\nIn conclusion, while the economic and social conditions that young people in Singapore face today are in many ways quite different from those of previous generations, they are no less challenging or difficult. Additionally, the young in Singapore have demonstrated significant commitment to causes they believe in, as well as increasing levels of engagement in socio-political and economic affairs.

In the political sphere, young people today have to deal with complex issues such as political polarisation, foreign interference and the erosion of democratic norms.

In some cases, factors such as socioeconomic background or educational level can create barriers that prevent individuals from progressing and achieving their full potential.\n\nFurthermore, the fast-paced and highly competitive nature of modern society can also lead to increased stress and pressure among young people. The constant need to excel and achieve can create a culture of burnout and anxiety that can adversely affect our mental health and well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that while young people today do have many advantages and opportunities that were not available to earlier generations, it is important to recognize that access to these privileges is not universal. As we continue to progress as a society, it is crucial that we strive to ensure that all young people have equal access to the opportunities that will enable them to reach their full potential."

Until recently, much faith has been placed in costly climate-change solutions such as solar panels, biofuels and carbon capture technology. Yet, these examples of green technology have not proven to be the panacea that they are touted to be. As long as wind turbines and solar panels remain more expensive than fossil fuels while working only intermittently, they will never be the solution to our energy woes. As of 2016, Germany, the world'slargest per capita consumer of solar energy, produces just 6.6% percent of its energy. And to achieve this number one status, the country has invested $130 billion in return for $12 billion worth of energy. The net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the century? Just 23 hours. Similarly, biofuel production is now consuming 40 percent of the US corn harvest, even though it supplies only 4 percent of the transport fuel used in America. Around the world, the turn to biofuel crops is resulting in higher food prices \u2013 and hence increased hunger. It is estimated that if the European Union were to derive 10 percent of their transport fuels from biofuels, the price of food could increase astronomically by 76% or deprive an additional 600 million people of food. Indeed, the prevalent belief in green technology to save our earth has proven disappointing and constitutes yet another reason for explaining why it has been so difficult to save the environment. But this should not lead us to despair as there is now a growing consensus that we should divert some of the attention and resources on green initiatives to producing solutions for more obvious and needy problems, which would hopefully generate positive knock-on effects for the environment. World Wide Fund for Nature in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand has introduced blockchain technology to track the migration of tuna, allowing scientific researchers an insight into global fishing, vessel traffic, and the potential effects of overfishing. The World Research Institute has also incorporated an open-source online forest monitoring and alert system which depends on data contribution from users on the ground to investigate forest health and deter illegal logging. Poco a poco, these small steps which are dependent on mass collaboration and effort have had a transformative effect on the way in which we tackle the effect of anthropogenic activities on the environment.\nTurning to the domestic level, a crucial aspect to understanding why it is so difficult to save the environment is local politics, and the lack of political will on a local level. In the United States, the world'ssecond largest emitter of greenhouse gases, politicians often ride into office on a ticket sponsored by large corporations with considerable vested interests. Corporatism is literally entrenched in the American constitution and in its politics. Profit-seeking corporations often hope that the politicians they endorse will implement policies that allow them to make more profits, and politicians are thus beholden to their powerful backers. As such, politicians are unlikely to implement policies that can help the environment but which may hurt businesses, for fear of offending their corporate sponsors and ruining their political careers. For instance, it is well-known that many Washington politicians have links to \"Big Oil\" \u2013 influential companies dealing in oil and energy. During his first month in office, President George W. Bush appointed Vice-President Dick Cheney to head a task force charged with developing the country'senergy policy. The group \u2013 which conducted its meetings in secret \u2013 relied on the recommendations of Big Oil behemoths Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP America and Chevron. It would be the first of many moves to come during the Bush administration that would position oil and gas companies well ahead of other energy interests with billions of dollars in subsidies and tax cuts \u2013 payback for an industry with strong ties to the administration and plenty of money to contribute to congressional and presidential campaigns. However, the good news is that in many countries, \"green parties\", which are political parties who campaign on the platform of environmental conservation are slowly but steadily gaining popularity and votes among the electorate who is also becoming more well-informed about environmental issues thanks to greater media attention and coverage. Millennial politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have placed environmental advocacy at the forefront of their political agenda and have proposed drastic measures like the Green New Deal, suggesting a paradigm shift towards greater political will to solve pertinent environmental issues.\nIn the final analysis, while history has shown us that the obstacles to saving our planet are real and formidable, recent changes in mindsets, policies and practices provide us with hope that they are not insurmountable. In time to come, the optimist in me believes that these hurdles can be removed as we work towards a cooperative yet realistic stance on saving our environment both at the international and local levels.",

Therefore, it is evident that technological innovations have made it possible to develop sustainable solutions that can save the environment.\n\nFurthermore, environmental conservation is not just about saving the planet. It also has economic benefits. For instance, eco-tourism provides an alternative source of revenue for countries that rely on natural resources. Tourists are willing to pay to visit natural habitats, such as national parks and nature reserves, providing income for local communities. Sustainable agriculture is another example of how environmental conservation can have economic benefits. By promoting sustainable farming practices, farmers can reduce their impact on the environment while increasing their crop yields, leading to higher profits. Therefore, environmental conservation has economic benefits that should not be overlooked.\n\nHowever, environmental conservation efforts have not been without challenges. One significant challenge is the lack of political willpower. Environmental conservation often requires significant policy changes that can be politically difficult to implement. For instance, policies that require corporations to reduce their waste production can face significant opposition from business interests that prioritize profits over the environment. Lack of financial resources is also another significant challenge to environmental conservation efforts, as it can be costly to implement eco-friendly solutions. Public attitudes towards environmental conservation can also be a challenge, as some people may view it as an inconvenience rather than a necessity. Addressing these challenges will require significant effort and collaboration between various stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument that we should stop trying to save the environment is not valid. The environment is a critical component of the planet that has a significant impact on our lives. Man-made activities, which pose a significant threat to the environment, make it necessary to continue environmental conservation efforts. Technological innovations have made it possible to develop sustainable solutions that can help save the environment while also providing economic benefits. However, challenges such as a lack of political willpower and financial resources must be addressed to make significant progress in environmental conservation efforts. It is clear that saving the environment is not a futile effort, and we must continue to make every effort to protect it.",

The sad fact is that the environment has traditionally been viewed as an issue of marginal importance in politics. Many politicians view the environment as a niche issue that commands little attention from voters, and they are often reluctant to take tough and unpopular decisions that have a direct impact on voters' current quality of life. Some even oppose environmental measures as unnecessary interference that hampers businesses, thereby affecting livelihoods. This reluctance or resistance to do as much as is necessary in the pursuit of environmental conservation is manifest in the lack of political will. This is often brought to the fore through governmental red tape and bureaucracy which leads to delayed implementation of environmental policy. All these political realities suggest the need to change the way we approach environmental conservation, and to place the issue front and center of global politics. One way in which this has been done recently is through the coming together of various governments and organizations to sign the Paris Agreement in 2015, an unprecedented global pact to fight climate change and limit global warming. Although the treaty was not without its detractors, the fact that 195 countries signed on to it underscores the global political will to tackle the problem of environmental decline.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that the challenges of saving the environment are numerous and immense, it is important for us not to give up hope. Through concerted international effort, informed economic policies, and a greater commitment from political leaders and stakeholders, we can start to tackle environmental problems head on. It is essential that we not lose sight of the big picture \u2013 that the environment is a nested system that is integrally connected to our lives and livelihoods, and that our stewardship of the planet is a collective responsibility that we owe to future generations.

Politicians are often reluctant to take bold actions that would potentially cost them political capital. Decision-makers face the challenge of balancing seemingly competing interests of various stakeholders and groups within their countries. This has resulted in many countries failing to meet their environmental commitments, such as the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration. However, with increasing public awareness and protests, politicians are being held more accountable for their actions and inactions towards the environment. Several countries such as Costa Rica, Bhutan and Germany have put in place environmental policies that have contributed to their high rankings in the Environmental Performance Index. Electoral victories by politicians who have a stronger track record of environmental conservation and promises to take climate change seriously are also an encouraging sign, signaling a change in societal values and priorities.\nIn conclusion, the difficulty in saving the environment cannot be pinned down to a single cause, but rather, it is a complex interplay of factors that require a multifaceted approach to address them. While global cooperation on the issue is essential, countries must also find ways to balance economic growth with environmental conservation, and politicians must be willing to take bold steps to address the issue. It is important to recognize that incorporating environmental considerations into a country's development plans does not necessarily detract from its economic growth, but can be a catalyst for a more sustainable future. With continued effort and collective action, we can hope to reverse the trend of environmental decline and create a better world for future generations.",

Many politicians are too preoccupied with short-term goals such as economic growth and winning elections to prioritize long-term environmental concerns. In addition, environmental action is oftentimes seen as an unnecessary cost, as many people fail to see the direct link between environmental problems and their daily lives. This skepticism has been exacerbated by business interests, especially those in the fossil fuel industry, disseminating misinformation to the public to undermine the scientific consensus and sow fear and doubt about climate change. This has eroded the public's confidence in scientific experts and hindered the public from realizing the real urgency of the situation. Fortunately, the views of those who deny climate change are becoming less and less mainstream, and people are beginning to take note of the damage that has been done. Governments and civil society alike are using various methods to raise awareness of environmental causes, including social media campaigns, climate change marches, and public lectures by climate leaders. Through these various avenues, people are beginning to see that environmental conservation is every person's responsibility and that even small actions can lead to positive change.\n\nIn conclusion, while the problems facing the environment are complex and multifaceted, sustained and collective effort has the power to affect positive change. At the global level, it is important for nations to realize the shared responsibility we have in combatting climate change and to find ways to work together. On the economic front, we must recognize that economic growth and environmental conservation can go hand in hand. Finally, at the domestic level, there is a need to raise awareness and foster political will for environmental conservation. Together, we can make strides to save the environment and ensure that future generations will inherit a more sustainable world.",
                "adually encourage more corporations and countries to realize that it is imperative to strike a balance between economic growth and environmental conservation, and that they should take conscious and concerted action to achieve this balance.\nAt the domestic level, political factors have also made it difficult to save the environment. In many countries, environmental concerns have often taken a backseat to winning votes and securing power. Environmental policies have been sacrificed on the altar of electoral expediency, as governments prioritize the provision of short-term economic relief over long-term environmental stability. For instance, in 2017, President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the Paris Agreement, a global pact aimed at combating climate change, citing that the agreement undermined US competitiveness and sovereignty. Likewise, many politicians often regard environmental activism as a fringe issue that lacks popular support, and are often wary of affecting existing industries that contribute significantly to the economy. Such complicated political decision-making has contributed to the inability of countries to agree on global environmental standards and limits. However, the increasing prominence of the environment as a key concern in many countries in recent years has put pressure on political leaders to not neglect this issue any longer. In Singapore, for instance, the 2015 transboundary haze that emanated from Indonesian forest fires galvanized a large group of individuals towards environmental activism. This pressure from civil society has coincided with a time when political leaders across the globe are waking up to the urgent need to take action, in the face of dire environmental consequences.\nIn conclusion, the question of why it has been difficult to save the environment is a multifaceted one that involves complex economic, political and social factors at the global, national and individual levels. However, as we can observe, there are positive signs that more countries and corporations are recognizing the urgent need to balance economic growth with environmental protection. We need to continue to push for change and demonstrate the urgency of this issue, and we can remain hopeful that sustained and concerted efforts would pay off in the long term, resulting in a healthier and more sustainable planet.",
                "adually translate into policy changes both at the corporate and national levels and pave the way for more sustainable economic activities that simultaneously promote environmental protection.\nDomestically, it is often argued that the failure to save the environment is due to a lack of political will from governments to prioritize this agenda. Indeed, this point cannot be overstated enough given that spearheading environmental protection is often electorally unpalatable and involves difficult trade-offs with regard to budget and resources allocation. Nevertheless, it is also true that many politicians have been able to achieve significant results through the mobilization of public opinion on environmental issues. European politicians who led the charge in implementing the Paris climate agreement provide a good example of this. As the Financial Times noted, one reason behind the unprecedented success in global co-operation on climate change \"is the resounding support that the Paris Agreement received from the global public, parliaments, businesses, faith leaders, cities and civil society\". With pressure from different groups and stakeholders, politicians have to take environmental conservation seriously and include this in their policy agenda. Similarly, the ongoing climate change strikes led by young activist Greta Thunberg has garnered much global attention and led to the public shaming of leaders who fail to act on this critical issue. These groups of vocal activists provide a critical reminder that politicians are accountable to their constituents and that people power can bring about change when leaders are unresponsive to public concerns.\nFinally, one of the biggest obstacles to better environmental protection is the apparent apathy of many individuals who do not see how their individual actions can change the state of the environment. This fatalistic view is understandable given that the problem of environmental degradation seems so vast and insurmountable. However, as individuals, we do have a role to play in the protection of the environment. We can start by practicing small, environmentally conscious habits such as reducing plastic usage, taking public transportation, and conserving energy at home. By incorporating these practices in our daily lives and inculcating environmental consciousness in younger generations, we can start to shift the culture towards better environmental stewardship.\nIn conclusion, saving the environment remains an enormous challenge, requiring concerted efforts from many stakeholders at different levels. While detractors may argue that it is impossible to prioritize environmental protection over economic development, that the issue is best addressed through multilateral collaboration, or that individual actions make no difference, the examples cited above show that these obstacles can be gradually overcome. If we continue to work together, we can certainly find ways to protect our planet and ensure that future generations are able to thrive in this beautiful and bountiful world.",

For example, the lack of political backing in the United States has hindered efforts to make environmental protection a national priority. President Donald Trump's announcement in 2017 to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement has undoubtedly set the fight against global warming back by years. Similarly, in countries like Malaysia and Indonesia, the struggle against air, water and land pollution is confounded by political corruption and lack of accountability. In Malaysia, for instance, the recent discovery of illegal dumpsites that spread pollution across Selangor and Johor state was only uncovered after long public protests. Although there is no quick solution to such entrenched problems, it is imperative for civil society to hold politicians accountable so that they prioritize environmental protection and promote more effective governance. For instance, engaging in citizen science, activism and public awareness campaigns can pressurise elites to take environmental concerns more seriously and commit to more sustainable practices. Grassroots efforts and community-led initiatives have also shown their potential to successfully galvanize state efforts to address environmental degradation.\nIn conclusion, there are a multitude of factors that have hindered our collective efforts to save the environment. However, as the above discussion has illustrated, we should not be discouraged from taking collective action on environmental conservation. It is essential to continue the drive towards greater international cooperation, increased awareness of the complementary relationship between economic growth and environmental protection, and stronger political will at all levels. Although every campaign to save the environment may seem like an uphill climb, we have to climb the hill we see in front of us. There is no nobler goal than protecting the earth we inhabit for generations to come.",

Governments often succumb to the temptation of using environmental policy as a tool in domestic political games, as opposed to for the greater good of the international community. For example, US President Donald Trump's decision to pull out of the 2015 Paris Climate Accord is a clear demonstration of his prioritizing domestic political considerations over the importance of collective climate change action. Moreover, it is worth acknowledging that many countries have been slow to make much-needed changes on their own because doing so may be met with public opposition and an unhappy electorate. This has often led countries to shy away from drastic action, due to concerns over protecting their votebanks. Nonetheless, the sustained activism of environmental organizations and climate change advocates around the world has proved instrumental in increasing the public focus on environmental challenges over the last few years, forcing governments to take the issue of climate change more seriously. With movements spearheaded by activists such as Greta Thunberg that have gone mainstream, it is increasingly difficult for governments to remain intransigent on this front. We can see this shift in the UK, where the Climate Change Act (2008) was implemented following a long-drawn campaign against the government's delay in acting on climate change. Thus, while politics undoubtedly remains a hindrance to environmental activism, the global response and awareness of environmental issues suggest that public pressure can play a pivotal role in pushing governments to act on the growing environmental hazards.\n\nTo conclude, the challenge of saving the planet from environmental disaster is complex and multifaceted. It requires a shift in public attitudes towards accepting that conservation and economic growth are not mutually exclusive and the need for collective approaches to tackle a looming crisis. All nations, both developed and developing, must be willing to take responsibility for the shared responsibility of environmental stewardship, while individual citizens must continue to put pressure on governments to take appropriate and necessary action. These moves are imperative if we have any chance of arresting the environmental decline that is currently threatening the health and wellbeing of our planet.",

One major problem is the widespread apathy and denialism surrounding environmental issues. Many people simply believe that environmental preservation is not a pressing concern, or that it is something that only activists and environmentalists need to worry about. This mindset can be attributed in part to a lack of education and awareness on the subject. Environmental education programmes are often underfunded and under-resourced, and not enough is being done to encourage people to adopt sustainable lifestyles. Additionally, political factors such as the short-termism and lack of political will may also be hindering progress. Elected officials, especially those in democratic societies, are often more concerned with winning votes and pandering to the electorate than with addressing long-term issues such as environmental conservation. This is further compounded by the consequences of big businesses' influence on politics, as they seek to protect their interests by ensuring that regulations and laws do not impact their bottom lines too significantly. As a result, effective policy-making on environmental issues may be delayed or sabotaged altogether.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges of saving the environment are myriad and complex, stemming from problems at both the international and domestic levels. Nevertheless, it is important to remain optimistic and keep pushing for progress. Encouragingly, there are signs that the rift between developed and developing countries over environmental responsibility is narrowing, and that economists are beginning to recognize the complementary relationship between economic growth and conservation efforts. At the domestic level, more needs to be done to raise awareness and spur action on environmental issues, and pressure must be exerted on political leaders to prioritize policies that protect the environment for future generations. It is only by working together, across national borders, socioeconomic strata, and different political philosophies, that we can hope to overcome the challenges and achieve a sustainable future for all.",

On one hand, governments tend to adopt a top-down approach, using regulations and policies to effect change in society's environmental behaviours. This approach is arguably necessary as individuals and corporations might not have the incentives needed to reduce pollution or conserve energy without government intervention or intervention through penalties. On the other hand, government intervention can be too intrusive and inefficient, leading to unintended negative consequences. A well-known example of this is the Singapore government's 1992 decision to introduce the Central Provident Fund (CPF) vehicle class in order to curb air pollution when it was found that diesel-fueled vehicles were major contributors to Singapore's air pollution. The subsequent heavy taxation of diesel vehicles led to the collapse of the diesel taxi industry, creating serious social impacts on drivers and car-owners. People then called for more nuanced environmental policies that were tailored to specific conditions and that also took into account social factors. As such, a balance needs to be struck between government policies and the need to take into account the interests of individuals and businesses. Educating the public on the benefits of conservation efforts and the costs of environmental degradation can serve as crucial means to gain their cooperation, as seen in various public education campaigns. Furthermore, as individuals, we can also play an active role in promoting environmental conservation by reducing our own carbon footprint, through simple lifestyle changes such as using public transport, taking steps to reduce energy consumption at home, and reducing plastic waste, among others.\nTo conclude, there are multiple reasons why it has been difficult to achieve environmental conservation. Nonetheless, it is heartening to see that efforts both internationally and domestically are underway, and that we are now starting to recognize the importance of balancing economic development with environmental conservation. It is my fervent hope that we will continue to strive towards this delicate balance between growth and conservation, and that through collective and sustained efforts, we can arrest the negative downward trend of environmental decline.",

Consumers are more aware of the negative impact of their purchases and carbon footprint on the environment than ever before, but many still continue to make choices that contribute to environmental degradation. This is due, in part, to the fact that people are often more willing to take actions that are convenient and inexpensive for them instead of more inconvenient but eco-friendly alternatives. In order to change this behavior and make environmental protection more appealing to the masses, interventions such as government subsidies for green products and public campaigns that emphasize the immediate benefits of environmental conservation need to be implemented. For example, in Singapore, the government has implemented numerous initiatives, such as the Green Mark scheme, the annual Clean and Green Singapore campaign, and the mandatory carbon emissions reporting for companies, to raise public awareness about environmental degradation and educate its population on how their individual actions can have a positive impact. While these initiatives have had varying degrees of success, they remain critical in effecting individual behavioral change, which is vital for saving the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, saving the environment is not an insurmountable challenge, but one that requires concerted efforts at the global, domestic, and individual levels. At the global level, nations need to come together and take collective responsibility for environmental conservation, recognizing that their interests are intrinsically linked. At the domestic level, governments and individuals need to take a more proactive and sustained approach to changing their behaviors and attitudes. Finally, at the individual level, we need to acknowledge our role in environmental degradation and take action to adopt green habits that can make a difference.

The environment's value cannot be underestimated, and with man-made activities continuing to pose a significant threat to its survival, it is necessary to continue with environmental conservation efforts. Furthermore, technology has made it possible for us to develop sustainable solutions that can help save the environment.

            "prompt": "\"SPORT UNITES MORE THAN IT DIVIDES\". HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "football on the battlefield. This unexpected show of unity between men who at that point had been trying to kill each other for months is a clear example of the power of sport to bring communities together and give even the most hated of enemies a means of escape from the cycle of hatred that pervaded those times. In fact, the Olympic Truce can trace its origins to the 9th century, where Iphitos convinced other rulers to end any conflict for a week before and after the Olympic games in the spirit of sportsmanship and universal peace. The amazing unifying ability of sport to allow individuals to cast aside their differences and come together in the spirit of the games amplify the unique place sports occupy as an instrument for unification that is strong enough to bring people together even during the most divisive times in human history.\nHowever, when passion for sport is taken too far, it can lead to an excessive and unhealthy rivalry amongst athletes and their fans which could have a divisive effect on the community instead. When passion is taken to extremes and transforms into unwarranted hatred and violence amongst rival fans and players, this can lead to an incredibly divisive and unstable atmosphere that could lead to hostility and even violence. This was unfortunately seen during the 2016 European Championships in France where rival fans took their sporting rivalries too far and engaged in violent brawls with opposing fans throughout the tournament leading to many being thrown behind bars and even more ending up in hospitals due to the mass violence and chaos that these confrontations caused. Instead of being a time for fans to come together over the spectacle that was supposed to be Euro 2016, the hyper-intensified passions and rivalries of these fans caused the tournament to be marred by violence and resulted in divisive sentiments amongst the different countries and their supporters, who pushed the blame to one another for the outbreak of the violence. Thus, when taken to excess, passion and rivalry in sport can transform into mass hysteria and violence, leading to the division of sporting communities as they begin to clash over their loyalties and overzealously express their support through violence.\nFurthermore, when sport is exploited to push political agendas, it can be used as a tool to create divisive sentiments, which goes against the true spirit of sportsmanship. Despite many believing that sport and politics should remain at arm'slength from each other, political agendas and sentiment often creep into sport as governments sometimes see it as one of the easiest and most publicly visible avenues to drive ideas and agendas, some of which are detrimental to harmony. One example of this exploitation of sport can be seen through the recent denial of visas for two Pakistani shooters to enter India to participate in the shooting World Cup. This was attributed to India'sbelief that Pakistan has not done enough to tackle the violent militias hiding within its borders. This fuels the international and domestic narratives that India is trying to champion, which is that Pakistan is a terror state and that it should not be trusted. This blatant use of sport as a political tool disregards the rights of athletes to free and fair competition. It also uses sport to push political agendas in a highly visible public setting, leading to the rise of division as these actions are debated and even championed by some in the public. When governing bodies go against the spirit of sport and use it for their own political gain, it can lead to greater divisions in society as the use of such a publicly visible medium often riles up support for these actions and in turn causes people to see these divisive acts as justifiable and necessary.\nUltimately, sport on its own is designed to unite communities through the shared values and interests associated with sport. Sport allows individuals to grow and learn together, giving people an avenue to interact while leaving all preconceived notions and animosities at the door, allowing them to see past their differences and bond as human beings with the same shared interests. However, if the competitive nature of sport is taken too far without restraint, or if sport is used as a means to a political end in particular, we detract from the inclusive nature of sport, and inadvertently promote divisive violence and animosity throughout society. Thus, despite the fact that sport does unite much more than it divides, if left unchecked and allowed to continuously be exploited, sport could become one of the greatest tools to divide communities around the world.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " that can be applied both on the field and off the field. For example, teamwork plays a significant role in sports like football and basketball. It is important to understand your role and work well with teammates to achieve common goals, positively affecting not only the team's performance but also their personal growth. Participating in team sports also teaches individuals the importance of discipline, hard work, and perseverance. It is not just about winning and losing, but understanding strengths and weaknesses, working on them, and continuously striving to be a better player and a more well-rounded person.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not to assume that sports cannot become a source of division. When competition is intense, emotions run high and sometimes, result in conflicts. Rivalry between teams, whether it be rival football clubs or national teams, has been known to result in violence and discord. For instance, the Division I league finals in football, dubbed the El Clasico between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, has been known to ignite deep-seated hatred among fans and has even caused conflicts between Spanish regions.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that sports serve as an essential means of bringing people together. Sports do not discriminate nor do they care about race, gender, or religion. It is a universal language, with its rules, and traditions uniting people across nations and borders. Sporting events have the potential to transform relationships, mend political relations between countries and create bonds of friendship that last for lifetimes. While there is no doubt that sports can sometimes be a source of conflict, it is negligible compared to the numerous benefits that sports bring. Sport promotes values of respect, teamwork, and discipline, instilling essential life skills in individuals that allow them to become strong-willed men and women who can endure any challenge that comes their way. Ultimately, sports unite individuals from different backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs, bringing them together and thereby creating a just and equal society.",

The game provided a brief reprieve from the fighting and gave the soldiers a chance to bond over their love of sport, leading to a moment of peace and brotherhood in the otherwise bleak and violent war. In the midst of the partisan conflict in South Sudan, the non-profit organisation Peace and Sport organized a football tournament in the capital city of Juba which saw players coming from across the country to participate. The tournament was a resounding success, with players from both sides of the conflict coming together to bond over their love for the game amidst the violence and chaos that surrounded them. This illustrates the powerful ability that sport has in uniting people and providing a semblance of normalcy and unity even in the most tumultuous of times.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are those who argue that sport can sometimes be divisive and disruptive, the fact remains that sport has an unparalleled ability to unite people from different backgrounds and bring together individuals based on their shared interest and love for sports. Whether it be by bringing different racial groups together or blurring geo-political boundaries, or even just providing a brief respite from conflict and war, sport has the power to transcend divides and show us the commonalities that bind us all together as one human family.",

Another example is the unifying power of sport in 2013 following the Boston Marathon bombings where runners from all around the world came together to pay homage to the victims and send a message of solidarity to the people of Boston. The marathon was followed by other sporting events which brought people together in support of the cause. Thus, in times of extreme chaos and violence, sport has the ability to bring people together and help heal the wounds of a strife-torn society.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are some instances where sport has been used to drive divisive ideologies and destabilise communities, such as the 1936 Berlin Olympics which were used by Adolf Hitler as a tool to further his Nazi ideology, the overall impact of sports on facilitating unity outweighs its negative impact. Through its power to allow people to see past race, religion, and political differences to focus on their shared love of sport and its ability to blur geographical boundaries, sport has and will continue to bring people together, making it a powerful tool for global peace and understanding.",

It has been able to mend torn bonds of mistrust and tension between the different communities and achieve reconciliation within the society. This goes to show that sport can act as a beacon of hope in times of darkness and its ability to unite people from all backgrounds during difficult times.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that there are instances where sport has been used to divide people and promote hatred, the fact remains that the positive impact of sport in bringing people together far outweighs its negative impact. Sport's unique ability to transcend racial and religious boundaries, blur geographical lines, and create moments of peace in times of chaos has cemented its position as being the ultimate unifier of societies.

It is a powerful reminder of how sport allows individuals to find common ground and come together in a spirit of unity and peace, even when the world around them is consumed by violence and chaos.\nIn conclusion, while sport may have been used in the past to fuel divisive agendas and fuel rivalries and hatred, it remains a powerful tool for bringing together individuals and communities by breaking down racial and geographic barriers, forging new understanding across cultures and ideologies, and creating a common sense of belonging around shared passions and interests.

Therefore, it is evident that sport has the unique ability to unite people even in the most extreme circumstances.\nDespite some arguments that suggest sport is divisive, it is clear that the benefits it provides far outweigh any potential negative impacts.

The Christmas truce showed how sport can stop even the most bitter of fights, and have the potential to become a basic human need in times of extreme violence and chaos. During the Syrian War, which has sprawled across the country since 2011, sport is being used as a means to bring relief and some respite from war, with Syrian national football matches becoming a rallying point for communities, and temporary ceasefires being initiated to allow matches to be played. This demonstrates that even in times of great conflict, sport can bring people together, counteract acts of violence and offer healing bonds when needed the most.\nIn conclusion, sport is far more likely to unite people than it is to divide them. It has an extraordinary ability to break down barriers both physical and ideological, and has the power to bring together people from all backgrounds and all walks of life. While there are occasional cases of sport being used to push divisive ideas and promote propaganda, these are outliers, rather than the norm. Sport remains the only platform that can unite people from a variety of backgrounds, to celebrate and experience a universal passion.

Thus, sports can be a source of unity even in times of great hardship and division, providing a path to heal wounds and promoting acceptance of people from all walks of life.\nIn conclusion, while it may be true that there are times when sports can be used to divide and drive home divisive ideas, it remains an undeniable fact that sport plays a crucial role in bringing individuals and societies together through a shared passion and common interest. Regardless of race, religion, nationality or level of ability, sports have the unique ability to unite individuals on a larger scale, often serving as a beacon of hope for greater understanding and acceptance among people.

Therefore, sport serves as a powerful tool that can be harnessed to bring people together in the wake of chaos and violence, highlighting the fact that it has the potential to promote social cohesion in even the direst of circumstances.\nAll things considered, while there may be instances where sport has had the opposite effect, resulting in further polarisation and tensions within and between communities, the overall impact of sport on social cohesion has been overwhelmingly positive. Much of this stems from sport's ability to bring people together through a shared bond of passion and zeal. Additionally, sport's unique location between culture, people, and geography enables it to serve as a uniting factor, rendering individuals more open-minded and tolerant to diversity. Ultimately sport has the capability to build bridges between people who are segregated by a range of factors, including race, religion, and politics, and even triumph over hardship to achieve unity and togetherness."

            "prompt": "IS THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY WORTHWHILE?",
            "human_gen_truncate": " found, like a wild flower, all over his dear country\". This suggests that individual freedoms are worth fighting for, and as established earlier, the erosion of the right to privacy ultimately cumulates into the erosion of individual freedoms, and should thus be decried. The right to have a life that is private and non privy to the prying eyes of the state is thus essential despite the risks it entails as without privacy, individuals will not be able to live their lives the way the want and express their true selves, effectively destroying the uniqueness and imaginative joy that makes life worth living.\nHowever, with the rising threat of crime and violence, the protection of privacy might not be as worthwhile as the need to protect people from acts of mass terror and violence may outweigh this. The ability to monitor individuals would allow states to better address the issues of rising crime and terror by giving them an avenue to better track individuals with a greater risk of being involved in criminal activities. States will also be able to set up alert systems to highlight any actions by individuals that could possibly lead to potentially damaging terrorist or criminal activity such as the planning of crimes of terror attacks by people within their borders. Allowing governments access to sensitive information would have allowed law enforcement agencies to prevent many of the attacks perpetrated by radicals and criminals such as the shooting at a mosque in Christchurch in March 2019 and the multiple school shootings that have taken place in America over the years. In fact, concerns about privacy have actively impeded pre-emptive measures and investigations. Former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief James Comey argued that encrypted messaging platforms, meant to safeguard the privacy of individual users, deprive governments and intelligence agencies of crucial information, \"giving terrorists a tremendous advantage against us\". Letting go of the desire for privacy might be the necessary sacrifice that will allow governments to finally get a step ahead of these criminals and extremists as the individualised nature of international terrorism and crime today makes it harder and harder for defence agencies to track and protect us against these threats, which could come from anywhere, even from the people living right next door. Relinquishing the right to privacy might be the only way to allow states to properly address the ever changing and complex network of international crime and terror, and protect us from the many different threats that are brewing just under the surface of society.\nThe protection of privacy is furthermore not worthwhile, as it may prevent people and states from taking responsibility for the actions and being held accountable. While privacy is largely individual, it also extends to states when they are being scrutinised by other nations. Allowing both states and individuals to hide behind the shield of privacy allows people of power to basically go about doing whatever they please without fear of condemnation, if they have significant enough means to keep news of their actions contained. For example, countries such as China have long been using the argument of privacy and national sovereignty to prevent the international community from properly investigating accusations of human rights violations against Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang that have been made against them. The country has used its power in the international community and political red tape to assert that what happens within the country is a private Chinese matter that the international community has no business in. Examples such as this illustrate how the idea of privacy can be used in order to prevent entities from being held accountable for their actions, instead hiding behind privacy as a means of burying and news about their actions. Thus, the protection of privacy is not worthwhile when privacy is just used as a tool to conceal the actions of people and states from the outside world in order to shield themselves from having to deal with the eventual repercussions of these actions, and continue to carry out these atrocities without fear of condemnation due to the protection that privacy give them.\nOverall, whether the protection of privacy is worthwhile depends heavily on the degree that our privacy would be taken away should we choose to stop defending it. Although the relaxing of privacy could have beneficial impacts to society by stopping people and countries from using it as a shield and be held accountable for their actions, and lead to states being more prepared and capable to address the threats that terrorism and crime have towards their communities, the complete relinquishment of privacy might in the long run lead to the loss of all individual freedoms and cause the countries of the world to descend into dystopian police states of our own making.",

We should not abandon our right to privacy simply because it is inconvenient or difficult to maintain.\n\nImportantly, there are many steps that individuals and organizations can take to help protect privacy. For example, companies can implement strong data protection policies, collect only necessary information, and be transparent about how data is used. Similarly, individuals can use tools like encryption and firewalls to protect their personal information online, be mindful of what they post on social media, and limit the amount of information they share with others.\n\nOne of the most important steps, however, is for societies to recognize the value of privacy and work to protect it - not just at an individual level, but also through legal and policy frameworks. This means ensuring that privacy laws are up-to-date and reflect the changing nature of technology, increasing transparency around government surveillance programs, and protecting the rights of individuals to control their own personal information.\n\nIn conclusion, the protection of privacy is undoubtedly worthwhile. While it may be difficult to maintain in today\u2019s rapidly changing world, the importance of privacy for individuals, society, and civil liberties cannot be overstated.

This is why the protection of privacy is important to the extent that it allows for sufficient monitoring while still maintaining a balance between privacy and security. Rather than resorting to complete control of the populace in order to prevent crimes and terrorism, we must recognise the value of individual freedom and privacy in fostering happiness in society. We must seek to find the balance between privacy and security, forgoing the right to privacy completely would lead us down a path of total control where we would have no control over our lives. It is our responsibility as citizens to stand up for our rights and ensure that they are protected, if not for ourselves, then for the generations that will come after us.",
                "remembered, and loved freedom with a martyr's love\". It is only in a society that guarantees individual rights and freedoms where we can hope to find the highest level of satisfaction and happiness. Therefore, the protection of individual privacy is critical as it allows people'sright to express themselves freely to remain intact, and thus they can achieve the happiness, which is the ultimate goal of society.\nHowever, as with most things in life, the protection of individual privacy can come at a cost: the cost of national safety and security. In the age of terrorism, it is essential that we are able to monitor and keep a watchful eye on individuals who could threaten public safety or the safety of the nation at large. By limiting the government's ability to monitor the activities of individuals and groups, we are potentially exposing ourselves to greater risks of terrorist attacks and violent crime. For example, if governments were not able to monitor communications with regards to terrorism, they would not be able to obtain information on potential attacks and prevent them before they occur, thus leaving the population vulnerable to danger. In this sense, the protection of individual privacy is not an absolute right that should supersede all other concerns, but rather something that must be balanced against other rights and interests, such as the need to secure the safety of the population. Therefore, as much as individual privacy must be protected, it should be done in a way that does not compromise national security.\nIn conclusion, while the need to protect individual privacy is critical, especially in a free and democratic society, there are situations where the protection of individual privacy must be balanced against other concerns such as national security. It is essential that we do not sacrifice individual freedoms for the sake of security, but rather strike a balance that allows us to maintain individual freedoms while keeping society safe and secure. We must strive to find this balance so that we can all live in a society that respects our individual rights and freedoms while ensuring that our communities are safe and secure.",
                "remembered forever,\" as portrayed in the movie Braveheart.\nHowever, while the protection of privacy is important, it is equally important to balance this protection with the need for states to monitor potential terrorist activities and to prevent crime and violence. It is difficult to come to a clear consensus on how much privacy should be given up in order to gain the benefits of increased safety, but ultimately, it is necessary for people and governments to discuss and come to a compromise on this matter. The challenge lies in finding the balance between the need for privacy and individual freedom, on one hand, and the need to keep society safe and prevent violence on the other. To achieve this balance, measures such as strict data protection laws and strict rules for the use of personal data by the state, along with clear guidelines on what actions can and cannot be taken in the name of safety, may be necessary. It is essential to ensure that the laws put in place to ensure public safety are transparent and open to public scrutiny, so that people know what is being done with their data and why certain actions are being taken. Without these measures, there is a risk that individuals could feel as though their rights are being eroded, leading to resistance and greater social tension.\nIn conclusion, while the protection of privacy and individual freedom is essential, it is equally important to balance this with the need for government intervention in order to prevent violence and terrorism intended to harm innocent people. Strict data protection laws and transparent measures to ensure the public is fully informed about government activities can help to ensure that the right balance is achieved. We must find a way to ensure that we can all enjoy our individual freedom of choice while living in a world that is free from the threat of harm and violence.",
                "remembered as a hero and a fighter for his people'sfreedom\" as the \"Braveheart\" movie puts it.\nHowever, despite the importance of individual privacy and freedom of expression, it is also important to acknowledge the need for governments to protect the safety and welfare of its people. In an age where terror attacks and violent crime seem to be more frequent and more deadly, it is understandable that people would want to feel protected by their governments. Governments do have a duty to prevent and address these issues, and this may sometimes involve monitoring individuals'activities. It is important that there be a balance between these two needs - the Protection of privacy and the need for safety and welfare. Governments should not be allowed to excessively monitor or control every aspect of its peoples' lives in the name of national security, but at the same time, individuals should not expect unconditional privacy when their actions could potentially endanger the safety of others.\nIn conclusion, protecting privacy and individual freedoms are important, as they form the basis of happiness and are indicative of a functioning democratic society. However, there needs to be a balance between these needs and the need for governments to protect the safety and welfare of its people. The loss of individual freedoms can easily escalate into the loss of democracy as we know it, where individuals are merely cogs in the machinery of a state. It is crucial that we continue to have discussions around the protection of privacy and the need for state monitoring in order to find the balance that will best serve individuals and societies alike.",
                "remembered\". In each of these historical events, people fought for their freedoms, including their right to privacy and non-intrusion, as it is essential to their personal well-being.\nWhile individual privacy is important, we must not forget that the protection of individuals and public safety is also as important. The recent bombings in Sri Lanka, the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, and the September 11 attacks in the USA, all serve as reminders on why governments need to monitor and intervene in situations where there is a serious risk of harm to the public. In these instances and many like them in the past, the consequences of not detecting and preventing the threats posed by terrorists would have left many with no choice but to accept more invasive forms of surveillance, as people would demand measures be taken to prevent future attacks and deaths. The role of governments in these situations is paramount, as they are tasked with the difficult job of providing the balance between individual privacy and public safety.\nIn conclusion, the protection of individual privacy is important as it allows people to live freely and express themselves without fear of being monitored, and it is this freedom that forms the basis of happiness. However, we must also recognize that there are times when individual privacy must be sacrificed in the interest of public safety. It is up to governments and lawmakers to find the balance between protecting individual rights to privacy and ensuring the safety and welfare of their people.",
                "remembered through the ages\" in Braveheart.\nHowever, as with all things, a balance must be struck between protecting individual privacy and giving governments the ability to protect their citizens from crime and terrorism. In order to do so, various measures could be put in place to address both concerns. For instance, governments could implement targeted surveillance measures, rather than blanket monitoring, so as to prevent infringements on the private lives of their citizens. Additionally, legal structures could be put in place to hold governments accountable for any signs of misuse or abuse of the surveillance measures. This would ensure that the privacy rights of individuals are not violated without appropriate consequences for the violating party. Furthermore, measures such as extensive background checking of potential government surveillance agents could be put in place to ensure that only trustworthy and qualified individuals are granted these powers.\nIn conclusion, the protection of privacy should be a fundamental right, as the loss of such a right effectively erodes the individual freedom and happiness of each person. However, governments also have a duty to protect the safety and welfare of their citizens, particularly in the face of terrorism and crime. A balance must be struck, with targeted and accountable surveillance measures put in place, to ensure the protection of both individual privacy and the safety of society as a whole.",
                "remembered in history, and died in agony, yet never surrendered in his quest for freedom\". These examples show the extent to which people value and fight for their freedoms, which include the right to privacy.\nDespite the importance of individual privacy, it is important to acknowledge that the need to protect the safety and welfare of people is equally crucial. There is no denying that in the world today, terrorism, crime and violence have become more rampant. Governments need to take action to prevent these threats from becoming more widespread. In order to do so, a certain level of surveillance and monitoring is necessary. However, striking a balance between protecting individuals and their rights to privacy while ensuring that there are no threats to the safety and welfare of people is not easy, but it is one that needs to be taken seriously.\nIn conclusion, the importance of individual privacy cannot be overstated. It is a basic human right that is necessary for the protection of individual freedom and happiness. Governments should not be allowed to encroach on this right, as it can lead to a society becoming a police state. However, it is important to acknowledge that protecting individuals against terrorism, crime and violence is also important, and this has to be balanced against the need for privacy. Therefore, in order to protect individual privacy and at the same time ensure the safety and welfare of all people, it is essential to strike a balance between the two.",
                "remembered as an iconic symbol of Scottish independence, deathless and free, never to be forgotten.\"\nFurthermore, there is also the concern that the use of surveillance for the purposes of protecting national security will lead to discriminatory practices targeted at specific populations, particularly those who are already marginalised. In the United States, for instance, there have been instances of racial profiling and the surveillance of Muslim communities following the 9/11 attacks. This has led to a loss of trust and a sense of alienation among these communities, and has served to deepen existing social divides. The same can be said of the continued use of surveillance in the ongoing Israel-Palestine conflict, where the use of surveillance technology by the Israeli government has been shown to perpetuate existing power imbalances and human rights abuses against the Palestinian people.\nIn conclusion, while the need for governments to monitor their citizens for the purposes of national security cannot be neglected, it is my view that this must be balanced against the protection of individual privacy, which forms the basis of individual freedom and autonomy. Any loss of privacy must be carefully calibrated so as to prevent the slide into a police state, and must be complemented by strong safeguards against discriminatory practices. Ultimately, the protection of privacy is vital to ensuring that individuals are able to live according to their own wishes, and to pursue the happiness that is the ultimate goal of society.",
                "remembered for centuries and gave his countrymen the gift of freedom\" as described by the movie \"Braveheart\".\nOf course, the protection of privacy cannot be absolute. There are circumstances where the need to protect the safety and welfare of society at large outweighs the right to privacy of individuals. For instance, when law enforcement officers need to conduct an investigation into a potential threat to national security, they may require surveillance measures to be in place. However, these measures should be clearly defined and implemented with transparency and accountability. It is important for societies to strike a balance between privacy and national security, taking into account the principles of proportionality, necessity and legality. Any restrictions on privacy must be justifiable and necessary in order to achieve the intended purpose of protecting the safety and security of the nation and its citizens.\nIn conclusion, I believe that the protection of privacy is essential for upholding individual rights, freedoms, and happiness, thereby preventing the descent into a dystopian state of surveillance. However, in certain situations, such as investigations related to national security, the protection of privacy may be justifiably restricted. The key is to strike a balance between privacy and national security, one that is transparent, accountable, and respectful of fundamental human rights.",
                "remembered, and gave even the stones of Scotland a voice to resound through ages\". Thus, individual freedoms and privacy are of paramount importance, as they are essential cornerstones of happiness and a life lived on one's own terms. The government must not deprive people of their basic human need to privacy, except when this becomes absolutely necessary for the protection of society, and even then, any surveillance or data collection program should be tailored and limited in scope.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate between the need for privacy and the need for security has been raging for years, but the protection of individual privacy is essential for a life of dignity, privacy, and happiness. While governments may have legitimate interests in monitoring criminal or terrorist activity in the name of security, this must be balanced against the rights of individuals to have their personal lives and decisions remain private. The protection of individual freedom and privacy is fundamental to the preservation of democracy, and any attempt to infringe upon it must be carefully scrutinised to ensure that the potential benefits do not outweigh the potential costs to society. As philosopher John Stuart Mill famously said, \"The only freedom which deserves the name is that of pursuing our own good in our own way, so long as we do not attempt to deprive others of theirs or impede their efforts to obtain it\"."

            "human_gen_truncate": "erica, more specifically Brazil, where it has been a popular health snack for a long time. Diversity in the healthcare and wellness industry has allowed the world to become better prepared and healthier by improving not only what we eat but also the ways we tackle illnesses and diseases through the sharing of different cultures\" knowledge and resources, improving the overall quality of life around the globe. It has allowed us to celebrate a time of unprecedented advancement in our healthcare systems and practices and drastically improved our quality of life in ways which would have been simply unimaginable otherwise.\nHowever, despite its benefit to the global economy, greater diversity can undermine the economic wellbeing of individuals within countries. Greater diversity in the economy often leads to countries and corporations valuing specialist and cheap foreign talent more than the talent within their borders. This can be seen in places such as Hong Kong, where the expatriate population is around four percent of the entire population of Hong Kong, creating a higher level of competition in the workforce for the local population than they had previously experienced. This is also seen in Singapore, which depends predominantly on foreign workers to meet its manpower needs in the construction, retail and food and beverage industries. With countries more willing to look at a diverse array of cultures for talent, locals in these countries and cities have begun to feel increased levels of competition throughout all levels of  the workforce as only the best and brightest can compete with the foreign experts at the top of their fields for jobs, while the competition for lower income jobs rises due to the increased number of individuals flooding to more developed economies to look for job opportunities. This struggle for employment however, has a greater effect on the poorer sections of the population as they may lack the skills to adapt and improve their skills to stay competitive, leading to the eventual rise in the income gap as the inflow of cheaper foreign talent for menial jobs causes greater problems for the poor than the introduction of foreign expats to the economy as these industry professionals have the means and ability to adapt and maintain their competitiveness in the job market. These fears underpin the rise of populist governments like that led by Donald J. Trump in the United States and right-wing governments across Europe, which capitalise on the concerns of the working class that they would be displaced. Thus, the benefits associated with a more diverse workforce, such as lower cost of labour and increasing quality of work,  should not be taken at face value especially since these measures implemented without proper regulations in place may lead to the widening of the income gap and other dire consequences for the country such as social instability.\nIncreased diversity and ease of movement could also make it harder for countries to develop due to the brain drain phenomenon, where talent in developing nations are more willing to venture overseas due to the diverse nature of the workforce in most first world countries. Local talent in developing nations will start looking to work overseas rather than staying locally as it would give them the opportunity to work in better environments and with better benefits due to the structural foundations that have already been laid overseas as opposed to in their homes. Furthermore, the diverse nature of local workforces also encourages them to move abroad as they feel more comfortable to peruse overseas opportunities with less of a fear of falling homesick. This has been happening for years in countries such as India where most of its top scientists and engineers move to developed nations such as America in pursuit of work, draining the country of a large number of its top intellectuals who could have been working in the country to help it progress. Out of 2.96 million foreign-born scientists based in Asia, Indian nationals number about 950,000, suggesting the extent of brain drain that India has to contend with. Uganda, too, has recently plunged into a healthcare crisis as more than 2000 highly trained medical professionals have chosen to leave for greener pastures in the Middle East. The loss of these top intellectuals to foreign governments and companies sets back developing nations by taking away the people that would have been their pioneers and leaders which would lead the country to a new dawn in terms of technological and economic growth, preventing these developing nations from steadily growing and improving into first world developed nations themselves. Thus, diversity, despite its benefit to the global economy, has left many countries without the means of developing as their top talents are more willing to leave the countries for greener pastures due to the increased job security and comfort that the acceptance of diversity has created for foreigners in the global economy.\nOverall, diversity has with it both positive and negative effects on the world as a whole. However, it is undeniable that with diversity, some will continue to fear it and the influence it has on the world. Despite this, with proper regulations to mitigate the negative effects that diversity brings with it, the benefits that diversity has on international cooperation, the global economy and healthcare and wellness alone should be enough to convince the world that it is something that should be celebrated and not feared.",

Additionally, the exchange of ideas and practices that comes with globalization has allowed companies to gain access to new markets that were previously untapped. This has led to the creation of new businesses and opportunities for individuals around the world.\n\nHowever, some individuals view globalization and the diversity it brings as a threat to their way of life. For example, individuals who hold traditional values and beliefs may view the increased exposure to different cultures and practices as a challenge to their way of life.

In Singapore, as in many other countries, multiculturalism is celebrated and there is a push towards creating a more diverse and inclusive society. However, some argue that this has led to a watering down of traditional customs and practices as people no longer see the importance of holding onto their own traditions in the face of a more homogeneous culture. There is also the fear that the emphasis on diversity may lead to the neglect of certain sectors of the population who do not have the resources to adapt to the new norms and customs of society, further widening the income and education gap.

This new era of diversity has led to greater cooperation between countries, improved methods of production and trade, as well as the spread of various different styles of medicine and healthcare products globally. This increased diversity in societies today has brought the world together in a more intimate way than ever before, leading to the ever increasing bonds that we see occurring between people all over the globe.

In this way, diversity in the healthcare and wellness industry has allowed people to access more varied, effective and healthy options that have improved their quality of life both physically and emotionally, benefiting individuals and societies as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, the increase in diversity in both society and the workplace has brought about numerous benefits across a range of industries, and the world should celebrate these rather than fear them. The benefits of diversity have improved the global economy, international relations, healthcare and the overall quality of life across the world. This celebration of diversity should, of course, be coupled with an acknowledgement of the difficulties it may bring about, but in doing so, the difficulties can be addressed and resolved to enhance the positive impact of diversity.",

In many Western countries, for instance, the tide of anger against immigration not just from the Middle East but from Eastern Europe, resulting in the rise of far right movements throughout Europe which aimed to establish a strong sense of national identity separate from that of others. In Asia, tensions often arise when people perceive their own culture is becoming less valued as foreign cultures enter their societies, sparking fears of a loss of identity and the erosion of traditional values. Yet even these attempts to preserve the dominant culture of an area can lead to the neglect of certain disadvantaged communities - such as minorities - as they are deemed a less important population and their needs are overlooked. In such instances, the focus should be on creating a balance that allows for both the preservation of traditional values and the inclusion of new and foreign elements that allow for a growth in diversity.\nIn conclusion, diversity is a positive force that brings countless benefits to the world - from greater international cooperation to economic growth, improvements to healthcare, and enrichment of daily life. We should celebrate diversity and its ability to bring people from all corners of the world together while still preserving traditional cultural practices. Our focus must be on continuing to find ways to manage diversity while maintaining balance in society, and recognising that what we lose in a \"dilution\" of our culture or society is more than offset by the immense benefits that increased diversity brings to our daily experience.",

From increasing international cooperation, to improving the global economy, to advancing the healthcare industry, diversity has shown how cultures, languages, traditions and beliefs from all over the world can come together to create a more positive world. While there may be further steps that can be taken to more effectively ensure that the needs of local people are met while focusing on greater diversity across the world, it is undeniable that diversity should be celebrated, not feared, for the positive benefits that come from it."

With the world continuing to progress, it has in fact created a more conducive and comfortable environment for its different heritages to grow and prosper by giving these heritages a new voice through the avenue of technology and social media.\nThe progress of society has also led to different communities across the world becoming more accepting of different groups and their cultural heritage. The progress that society has made towards the acceptance of different cultures has allowed them to thrive even beyond their original borders. Increased education and the message of acceptance that has been spread across the world as a result of globalisation and the ease of exchange of information and movement has witnessed cultures and heritage thrive in completely foreign lands as many of these heritages and traditions are brought along with their people as they move across the increasingly connected world. One prime example of this would be the rise of Chinatowns within major cities across the world, acting as a shining beacon of Chinese cultural heritage amidst a cosmopolitan backdrop in cities like Melbourne, New York and London \u2013 miles away from China itself. Indian food joints have similarly become ubiquitous in Western cities like London. Apart from being a place for people to maintain their cultural heritage abroad, these areas have become a way for foreigners to acquaint themselves with the cultural heritage of a place and community within the comforts of their own country. The prominence of different cultural experiences and images across the world has thus created a more inclusive and accepting world, creating a more comfortable and inviting environment for people to express and maintain their cultural heritage.\nHowever, there are often times when the preservation of heritage conflicts with and obstructs progress, preventing communities from improving due to their loyalty to heritage. The road to progress can often be destructive, with people having to sacrifice in order to advance. Oftentimes, progress can only be achieved if we are willing to give up our traditions and heritage as the resources that are important to these traditions are needed for the future. This struggle between heritage and progress can be seen in Singapore as the country continues to struggle with the issue of land scarcity while attempting to maintain the heritage of the country through the preservation of small, old buildings such as shophouses, which if allowed to be torn down to make way for new developments, could go a long way to solving the land scarcity issue. European cities like Prague, Krakow and Budapest often struggle to incorporate future urban development while preserving historical architecture, resulting in intricate and complex urban planning patterns centred around relics of the past. The nostalgia that many communities feel towards places and objects of their heritage can often cloud their judgement when it comes to the bigger goal of the community as they are unwilling to sacrifice their heritage to solve their modern problems. Thus, heritage often comes into direct conflict with progress as the only way to allow the world to continue to progress is sometimes to let go of our heritage and let progress take its place.\nOverall, as society progresses, so does the way heritage is viewed and manged by those in society. Progress has allowed heritage and traditions to enter a period of renaissance where they are more readily visible and accepted than ever before. Although heritage often does come into conflict with progress in certain areas, the progress that society has made has created avenues to work around these inconveniences and allowed the heritage of different societies across the world to become more global and more secure. Many would assume that as society progresses, there will be no place left for heritage in society, however, the opposite is in fact true: as society progresses ,it creates more opportunities for heritage to be preserved, spread and accepted in our modern and progressive community.",

            "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE THAT SCIENCE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RELIGION?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "is for us to better understand the natural world. Religious texts and their description of events are of great help to scientists hypothesising and corroborating theories about the world, such as how the theory about the Big Bang, a theory about how the universe came into existence, existed in some form within Christian religious texts for centuries. Nonetheless, the importance of the sciences to the progress of the human race is unquestionable: an understanding of the world through science is essential in allowing us to continue to grow and innovate for the future and not get held back by the artificial limitations imposed by religion.\nHowever, when we examine this debate from a different angle, it cannot be denied that religion is more important than science from a moral perspective as religion lays many of the moral foundations which govern the way human beings act. Much of what people understand as right and wrong has developed over the years due to religious influences, with many societies directly classifying actions as good or bad due to how their gods or their sacred scriptures would view these acts. For example, it is widely known that in many religions that act of murder is a sin and the Christian Bible even goes so far as to tell its followers to \"love thy neighbour as thyself\", demonstrating how religion often holds people to a higher moral code and reinforcing that notions of right and wrong come naturally to most. Legal traditions, which often draw inspiration from conventional moral standards, have been influenced by religion at some point or the other. In Thailand, Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion have been flawlessly integrated with modern concepts of public administration and legal process, introducing a framework for both religious discourse and legal authority. That said, it should be noted that religion may not be perfect in this aspect \u2013 religion is often used to justify acts of bigotry such as homophobia, as the Westboro Baptist Church suggests. Despite its flaws, religion does serve as a guide in many ways to how people should act, as all religions do tend to promote good behaviour and practises and reinforce strong moral character. Science on the other hand intrinsically lacks emotion and any moral compass as science is in essence entirely based on facts and outcomes. While religion alone does not make up the moral code of all humans, it does however form the moral foundations that many in the world choose to adhere to, demonstrating its important place in maintaining the moral compass of many across the world, and indeed even for those who have dedicated their lives to science.\nReligion is also more important and effective than science when it comes to bringing people together and forming bonds within the community. Religion gives people a common belief system that unites people, allowing people to come together to share their struggles and beliefs within their common faiths. Religion often forms the basis of many communities being one of the only things that can bring together people from different walks of life and even different parts of the world together, uniting people in a way that not much else can. The Hajj in the Islamic faith for example is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest site in the world for Muslims and a mandatory religious duty that gathers Muslims from around the world to worship and practise their religion. On a smaller scale, communities anchored by churches tend to rally when one of their own is in need of aid, and this is evidenced by church-run programmes like soup kitchens or donation drives. Research conducted by the Religion News Service suggests that religious people are three to four times more likely than non-religious people to engage in civic activism, be it volunteering their time with grassroot organisations, donating to social causes or engaging with their community. This uniting of people from a vast array of different countries and backgrounds based on their common beliefs and faith, demonstrates the unifying ability that religion can have on individuals as it allows them to bond and see pass their differences because of their common faith. Despite science being something that is used by all humans, the scientific method emphasises the use of logic and objectivity, and therefore its proponents may lack any spiritual connection due to its cold and clinical nature. It can be summarised as a discipline that is used by all but only understood by an advanced few due to the complex nature of science. Furthermore, although science has allowed people across the globe to interact more and understand each other'scultures through technology, much of these interactions and understandings happen at face value and do not evoke the same strength of community which is achieved through the spiritual connections that religion creates. Moreover, technology provides a means of increasing social isolation instead. The Stanford University for the Quantitative Study of Society noted a correlation between spending a significant amount of time on the Internet and people spending less time interacting with their families. Thus, the importance of religion in uniting people is unrivalled, with the efforts of science and scientific advancements paling in comparison to those of religion due to the emotional and spiritual nature of religion, allowing it to bring people together for a higher power and something greater than themselves.\nOverall, science holds a predominant role in underpinning our understanding of the physical world, with the majority of the tools we use to work, commute, and survive being a direct result of scientific innovations. However, religion is unique and unrivalled in its contribution to society'smoral, emotional and spiritual development through its ability to hold individuals to a higher moral standing and bind them through their religious beliefs in a way that nothing else can. Thus, while science is more important in terms of directly leading to the scientifically and technologically efficient world we have today, without religion, the world would lack unity and meaning, creating a society that is unable to tell from right and wrong and unable to create and innovate for the good and progress of humanity.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " evidence and data.\n\nFurthermore, science is continually changing, discovering, and improving our understanding of the world. The knowledge we have today is not the same as the knowledge we had a hundred years ago, and the same will be a hundred years from now. Science is self-correcting and is open to new ideas and alternate theories. Research and experiments conducted in science are reviewed by peers, which ensures that scientific claims are reliable and grounded in and accurate evidence. Owing to this nature of science, its reliability is unquestionable and its credibility never tarnished due to conflict and differences of opinions. Religious beliefs, on the other hand, have a fixed set of rules and traditions that should not be challenged or altered. This resistance to change makes religious beliefs less adaptable to the current changes of knowledge.\n\nLastly, Science is an inclusive practice that acknowledges and embraces diversity of thought rather than an exclusive religious practice. Religion demands us to believe in one particular God or deity and this makes it exclusive of other religions. It creates a fundamental divide. People who subscribe to different religions have different beliefs, practices, and worship different gods, which can lead to conflicts between groups. Science, however, is inclusive and allows for diversity of thought. Scientific discoveries are based on empirical data and evidence, and can be understood by individuals of different cultural backgrounds, religions, and beliefs. Science welcomes everyone irrespective of their beliefs and ethnicity. \n\nIn conclusion, Science and religion both play vital roles in the world, and people's lives, but when it comes to making decisions based on evidence, science is more important than religion. Science has the power to change and transform the world; its objective nature, self-correction, and inclusiveness make it a vital player in the world. While religion offers moral guidance and a sense of belonging, it cannot replace science in providing logical and rational explanations for the natural world.

Religion can also provide people with a sense of purpose and direction in life, imbuing their lives with meaning and direction. This importance of religion in shaping societal values cannot be overlooked, as it provides a foundation for how individuals and groups within society should behave and interact with one another.

Whilst science and technology may solve many problems, they cannot always guide people in terms of their moral values. Religion has been used to promote social ethics and cooperation in helping individuals develop their ideas of right and wrong, and has inspired countless humanitarian missions which have allowed people to address social issues across the world. Furthermore, religion has been proven to have a calming and stabilising effect for many individuals, helping to reduce stress levels, promote social connections and prevent anxiety and depression. The comforting nature of religion has provided many individuals with a coping mechanism for dealing with the stresses and strains that modern life can bring.\nTo summarise, while science may have the upper hand in terms of its tangible contributions to physical health, technological advancements and our understanding of the physical world around us, religion still holds tremendous value in promoting moral values, social ethics and providing individuals with psychological support. Whilst it may be difficult to objectively decide which is \u2018more important\u2019 between science and religion due to their inherently distinct and different goals, it is undeniable that both have played, and will continue to play, crucial roles in shaping the world around us.

It promotes intellectual honesty by insisting that any scientific inquiries must be testable and replicable. This is not the case with religion, where faith and beliefs provide the answers. As a result, religious beliefs are not subjected to the same degree of scrutiny and critical thinking. Critical thinking skills are essential for students to develop and succeed in their academic pursuits and professional careers. Therefore, prioritizing science over religion promotes the development of critical thinking skills that can be used in all aspects of life.\n\nIn conclusion, both science and religion have their place in the world, and each has contributed to human knowledge and understanding in their own way. However, science is more crucial since it has the power to transform the world, is objective, and promotes critical thinking and intellectual honesty. Scientific knowledge is essential to help us tackle the pressing problems of climate change, diseases and technological advancements. For this reason, we should prioritize science over religion in our pursuit of knowledge.",

Different religious groups, even within the same religion, have different interpretations of religious texts and doctrines. Therefore, it is challenging to use religion as a unifying factor in the diverse world we live in.\n\nIn conclusion, both science and religion have their significance, but science is more important because of its ability to objectively and universally provide solutions to real-world problems. Science also transcends cultural and linguistic barriers, making it a better tool for global cooperation. While religion offers spiritual guidance, comfort, and moral values, it does not provide objective solutions to the issues we face in the world today. Hence, science should be given priority over religion when it comes to making decisions that require factual evidence."

            "human_gen_truncate": "d negative consequences do arise. As society strives to enhance its technological prowess and overall standard of living, the changes that have been made to the way of life on the planet has resulted in the creation of modern problems. Anthropogenic climate change, for instance, is a direct result of the Industrial Revolution, which saw the proliferation of technologies such as the coal-dependent steam engine as humans sought to improve their quality of life. The changes that have occurred in the way that trade, transport and business are conducted have led to consequences such as the increase in air travel and the food we consume. These in turn have led to tremendous amounts of burning and deforestation in order to keep up with the need for energy. As a result, the amount of greenhouse gases has increased tremendously over the past 150 years, and close to 1.3 million square metres of forest cover have been destroyed since 1990. The blind pursuit of change and innovation, motivated by our obsession with improvement of quality of life, has led the human race to a time where the very existence of the entire human race is now under threat. It is often quipped that \"the road to hell is often paved with good intentions\", and indeed, while many desire change with altruistic motivations in mind, we must be mindful that these good intentions can and do sometimes lead to detrimental consequences for society in the long term.\nFurthermore, change can be detrimental if communities are unable to adapt to these changes, or if the effects of these changes are not appropriately managed. Many communities around the world have deep-rooted traditions steeped in history. Some of these traditions have directed the way these communities live their lives, with many being traditionally subsistence-based in nature. The focus on subsistence has caused many of these native and traditional communities to be unable to adapt to the changes that the world has undergone over the years, as they lack the education and the capital to entirely rework the nature of their societies and align it to the way that the modern world is structured. The Native American communities for example have struggled for years in the United States as their traditional subsistence-based nature and their deep-rooted connections to their lands have limited their ability to adapt to the nature of work and commerce in the 21stcentury. Without the tradition of working for monetary gain and the structures for a proper education system, these communities have often been left behind, swamped by drastic and rapid change, resulting in many of these communities having to struggle in order to survive in the modern economy. The change that the world experienced was therefore detrimental to these communities and their way of life as they did not have the conditions and structures needed to allow them to adapt in the modern world, leaving them vulnerable to the winds of change in the social, economic and technological domains. Besides traditional values, certain marginalized communities such as the poor bear the brunt of the negative repercussions of change due to their conditions and situations they find themselves in. The poor and uneducated sometimes find it challenging to pick up new skills and adapt to new technologies in a world that evolves at breakneck pace, where industries are constantly being disrupted and cheap foreign labour depresses their wages. Taxi drivers in Malaysia have protested against technological companies like Grab and Uber for threatening their livelihood, for instance, and they do not have any recourse against such obtrusive change. Thus, change can sometimes be undesirable as different communities adapt and come to terms with change at different paces, leaving many communities to suffer as the world speeds towards the future.\nOverall, to assert that change is always good would be an overgeneralisation of the nature of change and its many facets, while ignoring the detrimental effects that change can bring if it is not properly managed. Although change does have its benefits, these do come with their own sets of challenges which could in fact be worse than what we had experienced before. Ultimately, change is neither inherently bad nor innately good and a lot depends on how change is managed and how it is received by different groups within society.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "ment.\n\nHowever, not all changes are good. Some changes can lead to negative outcomes such as chaos, instability, and human suffering. For instance, changes in natural environments can lead to climate change, which poses a threat to human survival. Changes in social and cultural norms can also generate negative effects, such as the breakdown of family values and institutions. In some cases, changes can also lead to conflict, violence, and war. The world has seen significant upheavals and tragedies brought about by changes in political leadership, religious beliefs, and social identities. The Holocaust, Rwanda genocide, and the current Syrian crisis are examples of negative change that has led to millions of deaths and suffering.\n\nMoreover, changes motivated by greed, selfishness, or malicious intent can result in negative outcomes. Corrupt leadership, unethical practices, and illicit activities have been known to perpetuate injustice, inequality, and poverty. Changes that benefit a few at the expense of the majority are morally reprehensible and detrimental to society.\n\nIn conclusion, change is a mixed bag, and its impact depends on various factors. While some changes can promote progress, equality, and growth, others can lead to destruction and suffering. Therefore, it is essential to assess the nature, motivation, and outcomes of change before embracing it. If change is guided by noble goals, transparency, and accountability, it can lead to positive outcomes that benefit society as a whole. Conversely, if change is driven by selfish interests, greed, or malicious intent, it will result in negative consequences that harm society. Therefore, it is crucial to weigh the pros and cons of change before making a decision.",

                "d negative consequences have arisen leading to disastrous outcomes. Take Environmental changes, for instance. The push for modernisation has resulted in a drastic increase in carbon emissions which have caused climate change. This would not have been possible in the past but it is now, and the results are worrying with predicted extinction of species and rising sea levels among others. Similarly, AI is also argued to be a potential source of harm, if not regulated properly. While AI has many benefits, such as increased efficiency and speed in decision-making processes, it also has many risks. One such risk is that of bias in AI systems, with evidence suggesting that AI systems are starting to reproduce the biases present in human society such as racial and gender biases. Even as people eagerly embrace the benefits of AI, there are risks and potential harms that must be acknowledged in order to regulate it properly. Therefore, it is necessary to strike a balance between the benefits of change and the potential risks and harms associated with it.\nIn conclusion, change is a complex and nuanced experience that cannot be simplistically classified as good or bad. While it is important to embrace change and innovate, it is equally important to recognise the risks and downsides that come with it. As Singapore pushes toward the future, great strides are being made in the areas of climate change, diversity and inclusion and technological innovation. However, we must also be cautious and considerate, mindful of the potential risks of unintended consequences and the uncertainties of the future and strive to plan change in a way that maximises the benefits and minimises the harm.",
                "d consequences may emerge, leading to certain negative impacts. For instance, the advent of technology has led to the automation of certain jobs, resulting in job displacement for many individuals. While it is true that the advent of technology has provided numerous benefits such as increased efficiency and convenience, it also has caused hardship for many individuals who have lost their jobs as it replaces their roles. This has in turn created a wealth gap where those who have adapted have become richer, while those who have not have been left behind. The recent COVID-19 pandemic too exemplifies the downside of change as many lost their jobs due to lockdowns and business closures. This leads to a rise in social issues such as unemployment, homelessness and poverty, which can have long term effects on individuals. While the pandemic has had positive impact in terms of realigning our need to re-evaluate our priorities, the impacts on people\u2019s livelihood have been felt keenly. Evidently, change can lead to unintended negative consequences, particularly for those who do not adapt well or experience difficulties in adjusting to the changes.\nFurthermore, change can be disorienting and can cause a loss of social cohesion in society. When things change too quickly or excessively, many individuals may struggle to cope, especially since change does not always happen in a uniform way. For instance, the pace of development in emerging countries may be too fast for the society and people may struggle to adapt to a new way of life, resulting in social instability. In a modern context, social media has often been blamed for disrupting traditional power structures that managed cohesion in societies. This can be seen in recent protest movements such as Hong Kong\u2019s Umbrella Movement and the widespread Black Lives Matter protests in America that has led to protests and social upheavals and political unrest. Such an environment fosters division in society and leads to negative consequences that outweigh any positive benefits that the change may have brought about. Therefore, change can be bad when it is not done in a gradual and measured way where people are given ample time to adapt.\nIn conclusion, change can be both good and bad, depending on the context in which it occurs. The willingness to embrace change and the desire to improve has led to numerous innovations and prompted greater acceptance of newer ideas and standards of living. However, change can also be destructive and lead to unintended negative consequences such as job displacement and social instability. As such, policymakers and individuals alike have to be aware of these risks and take measured steps when introducing change, particularly in situations where the process may be difficult for some to cope with. While change can be a force for good in driving progress and development, it has to be done in a way that promotes social cohesion and does not leave anyone behind.",
                "d consequences arise, resulting in harm and difficulties for those who were initially meant to benefit. An example of this is the displacement of indigenous communities due to the construction of large dams and hydroelectric power plants that not only result in the loss of their homes and land, but also put them at risk of being exposed to environmental hazards such as water pollution and soil erosion. Another example can be seen in the agricultural practices of large corporations, which can have harmful effects on the environment, including soil degradation and deforestation. In these cases, change does not necessarily lead to progress, but instead creates new problems that may be just as damaging. Additionally, the pace of change can also be overwhelming and pose challenges in practically adapting to new ways of living. For example, the recent COVID-19 crisis has triggered widespread changes in daily life and economic practices, causing disruptions and difficulties in many areas. People have been forced to adapt to new living and working arrangements, which has brought about a range of challenges and anxieties in its wake. Thus, while change can bring about progress and innovation, it also presents certain risks and drawbacks that cannot be ignored.\nIn conclusion, change is an inherent part of life that can bring about improvements, innovation, and greater acceptance of new ideas. However, the effects of change are not always positive, and unintended consequences, as well as the pace of change, present challenges and risks that must be taken into account. The world is constantly changing and evolving, and it is important for us to recognise that change has a multifaceted nature that cannot be classified as solely good or bad. Therefore, it is crucial that we approach change with a critical and nuanced perspective, in order to reap its benefits while minimising its drawbacks.",
                "d negative consequences occur. Such consequences are particularly prevalent in industries that are highly regulated, such as the financial sector. Major regulatory changes are often implemented with the aim of enhancing investor protection and reducing financial risk. However, such regulations may inadvertently lead to increased costs and fees, a reduction in credit availability for certain sectors, and the deployment of risk-taking activities in unregulated financial spaces. In 2008, Wall Street firms engaged in increasingly complicated financial transactions that were designed to evade regulatory scrutiny, culminating in the near collapse of the global financial system. The financial crisis was a painful reminder of how regulations and change, despite their intentions, can have greater negative repercussions than positive ones.\nWhen applied in the geopolitical sphere, change can also result in major upheavals and destabilisation in societies. For instance, the 'Arab Spring' uprisings were a series of revolts in the Middle East against oppressive regimes from 2010 to 2012. While these uprisings were largely peaceful and aimed at peaceful change and better governance, the destabilisation that followed resulted in civil wars and the rise of extremist groups such as ISIS. As the situation deteriorated, terrorist attacks proliferated, destabilising entire regions and leading to a humanitarian crisis. Consequently, it is clear that change is not always good, as it can cause uncertainties and destabilisation, impairing the very society it was hoped to improve.\nIn conclusion, arguments that define change as always good are fundamentally flawed. While change brings about many good things such as innovation and acceptance, it also carries with it inherent risks in situations where change may cause great upheaval. It is imperative that we consider the potential costs and risks that come with change and ask ourselves whether change will lead to a better life for everyone. Only with a nuanced and informed view of change can we develop policies and make decisions that ultimately improve our world without undoing what we have already strived to achieve.",
                "d negative consequences can arise. For example, the Industrial Revolution in Europe during the 19th century created pollution and environmental damage on a massive scale, leading to problems such as air and water pollution and causing widespread consequences for people\u2019s health. Similarly, the rapid pace of technological progress has raised ethical and moral concerns about privacy and artificial intelligence. It begs the question \u2013 are we ready for the potential impact of technology on society? The recent Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal, where data of 87 million Facebook users were harvested improperly, has raised alarms on how technology can be easily manipulated to influence people's opinions. This shows that while change can be positive, it is not always without its risks, and negative externalities have to be taken into account when evaluating the benefits of change.\nFurthermore, changes often have an impact on people's livelihoods and their way of life. New innovations and technologies can replace old industries and jobs, leading to job displacement for certain individuals and communities. For instance, the global trend of automation and robotics is predicted to replace jobs in certain sectors with advancements in artificial intelligence. This can lead to a shift in economic power and create social unrest as employment opportunities become scarce and communities become divided. In addition, rapid urbanisation has led to a loss of cultural heritage and a break down of traditional community ties. The desire for change may be necessary for progress, but it is important to consider the impact of change on individuals and communities affected, and to provide transitional support for them. All these demonstrate how change is not always a panacea for society and cannot always be viewed as absolutely good.\nIn conclusion, change can be a force for good as it allows us to progress and improve as a society. It fosters innovation and creates a more inclusive and diverse world. However, it is important to note that change can also have negative consequences and potentially be harmful to society and individuals. The pursuit of change must be carefully weighed, and the risks and benefits of change should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Ultimately, change is not inherently good or bad, but is a complex and nuanced concept that requires thoughtful consideration and evaluation.",
                "d consequences may surface, causing harm and disruption to society. For example, the rise of industrialisation in the early 20th century led to undesired consequences such as pollution and exploitation of workers. Similarly, the introduction of social media and technology, while providing numerous benefits, has also brought about issues such as cyberbullying and addiction. Additionally, certain changes may disproportionately affect certain groups in society, causing harm and leading to social inequality. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted how change can lead to unequal impacts on different socioeconomic groups, with lower income families and minority groups being hit particularly hard. These negative impacts of change highlight how it can be a double-edged sword, with the potential to bring about both positive and negative effects on society, and the need to strike a balance between the two.\n\nIn conclusion, while change is often viewed as a necessary and positive force in society, it is important to recognise that its effects are complex and multi-faceted. While change can lead to innovation and improvements in life and promote acceptance and open-mindedness, it can also introduce undesirable outcomes and create social inequality. Therefore, it is important that we approach change with a balanced perspective, recognising the potential risks and benefits, and strive to mitigate any negative impacts as we continue to pursue progress and improvement.",
                "d consequences arise that lead to negative outcomes that could have been prevented. For example, the adoption of nuclear power as a cheaper and cleaner alternative to fossil fuel resulted in the creation of multiple nuclear disasters such as Chernobyl and Fukushima, which caused severe environmental damage and loss of life. Similarly, whilst technological advancements have created more jobs and increased efficiency, they have also led to the loss of jobs with low-skilled labour replaced with machines and automation. This has resulted in the creation of a divide in society where those who lack the requisite skills for the newer and more demanding jobs are left behind, leading to increased economic inequality. Therefore, the pursuit of change must be tempered with caution and careful consideration, as the risks and potential negative consequences of change must be evaluated properly before implementing it.\nFurthermore, not all changes create the same levels of benefits, and some changes may even have unforeseen long-term impacts on society that may cause more harm than good in the long run. For instance, the proliferation of social media has changed the way people interact and communicate, and whilst it has led to incredible advancements in information-sharing, it has also led to an increased sense of loneliness and isolation amongst people who are more comfortable interacting with others online instead of face-to-face. Additionally, social media has allowed the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can have severe consequences on political and social issues. Therefore, whilst change may have benefits that are apparent in the short term, careful analysis must be made to ensure that the pursuit of change does not have long-term unforeseen negative consequences.\nIn conclusion, whilst change is largely positive and is necessary for the progress of society, it cannot be taken for granted as being exclusively good. The pursuit of change should be undertaken carefully, with a recognition of the risks and potential negative effects that may arise, and the benefits weighed against the risks. By doing so, we can create a more equitable and just society that embraces the positives of change whilst avoiding the potential pitfalls that may arise from it.",
                "d consequences may occur. This is evident in many instances where human intervention in the environment has resulted in disastrous effects, such as deforestation, leading to soil erosion and destruction of habitats for many animals. Some technological innovations, such as the intensive use of fossil fuels, have also led to environmental degradation, and in turn, climate change, which has resulted in natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods and wildfires. These occurrences prompt many to question whether the benefits of change truly outweigh its negative effects. While change has the power to improve society and the world, we must also be mindful of the downsides and risks associated with change and ensure measures are in place to mitigate such negative effects wherever possible to avoid unnecessary harm.\nTo conclude, while change is generally seen as a positive agent of progress and innovation, the effects of change are complex, and its benefits and risks must be weighed carefully. Change allows us to constantly improve and evolve as a society, and with a willingness to change also sparks acceptance of diversity and unconventional beliefs, leading to a more harmonious world. However, we must also recognise the potential downsides of change, and approach change with caution, ensuring any negative effects of change are monitored and mitigated to the best of our abilities. Ultimately, by balancing the benefits and risks associated with change, we can strive towards a more sustainable, happy and equitable world.",
                "d consequences may result and these can have far-reaching effects that were not anticipated when the change was first initiated. For example, the industrial revolution in the 18th and 19th century, while characterised as an era of progress and innovation, had significant and devastating consequences for the environment. The revolutionary advances in technology allowed industry to grow at an unprecedented rate, leading to the widespread use of fossil fuels for power generation. However, the heavy reliance on these fuels has resulted in the current environmental crisis that we face today, characterised by rising sea levels, global warming and an increase in natural disasters such as hurricanes and typhoons. This inadvertently shows that change, while intended to be positive, can have catastrophic consequences for the environment, leading to long-lasting effects that may take decades or even centuries to correct.\nApart from environmental consequences, there are also social consequences that can result from change. The pursuit of change can lead to the marginalisation of groups that may not have the ability to keep up with the pace of change. In Singapore's context, the pursuit of technological progress and innovation has been prioritised, resulting in the marginalisation of elderly citizens, who may not be tech-savvy and therefore may have difficulty adapting to a technology-driven world. This can result in the widening of the income gap between the elderly and the younger generation, leading to social tensions and a sense of exclusion among the elderly. Therefore, the pursuit of change can leave certain groups behind and result in social inequality, leading to a range of undesirable outcomes.\nIn conclusion, while change is largely positive and necessary for society to progress and improve, it is not a black-and-white issue. The effects of change can be complex and multifaceted, and can result in unintended consequences that may have profound and long-lasting effects on society. Therefore, we must adopt a more nuanced view of change that considers the potential risks and downsides that may result. By being aware of these risks and actively managing them, we can ensure that change is implemented in a responsible and sustainable way, leading to a world that is more just and equitable for all.",

However, it also brought about significant pollution and environmental degradation due to the unchecked industrialisation and extraction of resources. Similarly, the advent of social media has transformed the way people communicate and consume information, but it has also given rise to issues such as cyberbullying, fake news, and surveillance. These examples demonstrate that change is typically accompanied by unforeseen side effects, which we must be mindful of in order to minimise the harm it causes.\nMoreover, change can lead to significant upheavals for those who are ill-prepared or adversely affected by it. Those who are reliant on certain industries or technologies may find themselves suffering as a result of changes that impact these areas. For example, the rise of automation is expected to lead to job losses in certain industries where humans are replaced with machines. Similarly, a change in government policy may impact certain industries or demographics negatively e.g. construction companies having to adapt to new regulations on building standards, or migrant workers facing new restrictions on employment opportunities. Thus, while change may be necessary and positive on balance, its implementation may exact significant costs on certain individuals or groups who are caught unprepared.\nIn conclusion, change can be largely positive as it promotes innovation and progress, and creates a more accepting and tolerant society. However, we need to be aware of the potential downsides and risks that change can bring, such as adverse environmental effects, unintended consequences, job losses, and social upheaval. As such, while we should strive to embrace and implement change when necessary, we must also be cautious and thoughtful as to how we go about doing so, in order to ensure that the benefits outweigh the costs."

In the last 3 decades, China alone has lifted more people out of extreme poverty than the rest of the world combined. Indeed, China's ($1/day) poverty reduction of 627 million from 1981 to 2005 exceeds the total global economy's decline in its extremely poor from 1.9 billion to 1.4 billion over the same period. The proven applications of science have thus underscored its noble intention of creating a more efficient and accessible global village for all of us to live in. However, with the rise of capitalism and profit-maximising enterprises, the noble intentions of science may have become less apparent. Indeed, in a capitalist world where monetary gains are used as a yardstick of economic and social success, many individuals and companies exploit science for greater profits but at a huge social cost. Few years ago, a multinational giant Monsanto introduced a genetically modified corn, which they claimed to be highly resistant to pests and could withstand extreme weather conditions.\nHowever, the genetically modified corn was found to have significantly disrupted liver and kidney functions according to a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences. Despite the findings, Monsanto continues to disregard the product safety concerns that threaten public health in pursuit of profits. Such self-serving behaviour may be traced to the selfish intentions of science, that is to amass wealth for oneself at the expense of others. Hence, there may be less incentive for science to have honourable intentions atall times under the modern capitalist system where the primary goal is the accumulation of individual wealth without any regard to a moral compass.\nMoreover, science will not have noble intentions when it is used to develop weapons. Nuclear science, the study of a nucleus of an atom and its reactions has provided mankind a completely new way to produce huge amounts of energy for people's consumption. On the hand, nuclear science can be used to create a destructive weapon capable of wiping a whole city awayfrom the surface of the Earth. This has caused many nations and terrorist groups to develop nuclear weapons in order to outrun the others in the arms race and protect its country. In World War Two, cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in japan faced the firstdestructive power of nuclear weapons, killing thousands of people in the city instantly. More recently, North Korea developed its nuclear weapon to threaten various countries, forcing the United Nations to accept certain demands made by the Prime Ministerof North Korea, Kim Jung Il. Again, people created develop such weapons to gain power against other nations, and intentions to maintain high moral principles during its scientific developments can be said to be non-existent. Thus, science will not have noble intentions if science was used to develop for the gain of power.\nIn conclusion, science often bears noble intentions to benefit humanity, in ways such as prolonging and saving lives,heightening productivity and paving the way for one world marked by unprecedented global economic and social development . However, as Albert Einstein had said, \"Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist.

The application of science has resulted in social inequality, such as the digital divide, where people who cannot afford technology or live in rural areas do not receive similar educational resources as those in urban areas. The political misuse of science has resulted in controversies, such as debates over the safety and efficacy of vaccinations.\n\nIn conclusion, science plays a crucial role in human progress and development. It has the potential to solve some of the world's most pressing challenges and improve the lives of people everywhere.

Consequently it is crucial that the media takes into consideration the audience to which it is targeting by the use of the demographic factor. Indeed, young children who are simple-minded and undiscerning may be easily manipulated by others' perceptions and false factual information. Hence, it is vital that undiscriminating children are sheltered from the profanity, nudity, violence and obscenity we often encounter in the media as adults as it may undermine their beliefs and value system. Nonetheless, there may be readers, apart from children, who are not able to stomach the violence and monstrosity contained in the graphic images or details. To exemplify this, the censoring of morbid images and videos of the Iraq War for the American society was essential to prevent any permanent damaging psychological effects on the general audience. Thus, it is absolutely critical for the media to exercise prudence in ensuring that the materials it produces for public viewing are acceptable across all age groups, so as to not offend any of its viewers. Last but not least, it is the onus of the media to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of any individuals such as witnesses, victims, or sometimes even the perpetrators of crime. When it comes to victims of rape, for instance, the identities of these victims have to be concealed to protect them from public harassment, discrimination or shame. In the case of the rape victim of the actor Michael Le Vell**, after her name was revealed on Twitter, a man suspected ofdisclosing this information was detained. Greater Manchester's police superintendent Phil Davies justified these actions of detainment as public identifications of victims of sex abuse, in particular child victims engaged in court proceedings can cause both immediate and long-term distress and harm. The management of information concerning victims of crime should not be taken lightly as this could be severely damaging and detrimental to their psychological wellbeing, and may also adversely impact their recovery process. For that reason, the media have the duty to ensure the privacy of individuals such as the victims, witnesses and young perpetrators of crime, to protect their identities and any confidential information. To sum up, the media should exercise vigilancebefore bringing up any issue in the vast array of topics. It is the responsibility of the media to protect certain sensitive national security information or confidential individual information. The media should also censor mentally-damaging images to safeguard the psychological wellbeing of its viewers and ensure that they are not at risk of any future repercussions, which may lead to dysfunctional lives.Therefore, governments in any country should work closely with the media to ensure these objectives aren't adequately, so as to maximise the welfare of the citizens.",

This harmful act can mislead the public about an existing situation, leading to the creation of unwarranted fear or panic among people. It can also cause significant harm to people or organizations involved. Instead, the media should report the facts in a way that can help people understand the issue at hand and encourage public debate and discussion.\n\nMoreover, the media must consider the age-appropriateness of content before reporting them. The media has a significant effect on children who are heavily influenced by what they see, read, or hear. Therefore, reports involving adult content such as sex, drugs, and crime must be reported keeping in mind the impact it might have on the audience. The media must aim to educate the children and not influence their views or beliefs in any way.\n\nLastly, the media must also consider the ongoing investigations before reporting on a topic. The law enforcement authorities may not have all the details they need to solve a case. Premature reporting might lead to the culprits getting away, destruction of evidence, or hindrance to justice. Therefore, the media should wait for investigations to conclude before publishing a report on a case. \n\nIn conclusion, the media has a significant responsibility to society, and it needs to maintain its credibility by upholding journalistic integrity. The media must report only after considering the impact their coverage can have on individuals, society, and national security.

Such graphic descriptions of violent acts could desensitise the public to violence and leave a long-lasting negative impact on their mental and psychological wellbeing. It is crucial for the media to report on such crimes factually, providing only necessary and significant amounts of information without compromising the dignity and privacy of the victims. For example, in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in 2019, the New Zealand media had consciously considered the sensitivities of the Muslim community before reporting on the matter. Instead of focusing on the violent acts and the perpetrator, the media emphasised compassion and solidarity with the victims and their families. This has only been possible due to the concerted efforts on the part of the media to report sensibly and not sensationalise an event for gaining readers and viewership. In reporting heinous crimes, the media has to be responsible in protecting the victims\u2019 dignity without losing sight of their role in ensuring justice.\nFinally, the media should also be mindful of the personal confidential information that is at its disposal. It is of utmost importance that the media does not disclose such confidential information without authorisation or consent, as it could severely infringe on the privacy and autonomy of the individuals involved. The media should exercise extreme caution in reporting matters that are of a personal nature, such as medical conditions, financial hardship and matters of personal life. For instance, in 2017, The Straits Times had to retract an article regarding a murder case after it was revealed that the information on the financial issues of the accused had been acquired unethically. The media has an ethical boundary that it must adhere to in upholding individuals\u2019 right to privacy, a crucial component of maintaining trust in society.\nIn conclusion, It is necessary for the media to wield its incredible power with utmost responsibility and discretion. Issues that ought to be kept confidential should not be disclosed by the media, since the results of doing so could be catastrophic. Rather, the media should be responsible in its coverage of issues such as national security, heinous crimes and personal confidential information, providing only necessary information without compromising the dignity of the people involved.

For instance, broadcasting and printing images of the victim\u2019s dead body or an excessively graphic portrayal of sexual violence can evoke trauma and distress among the family members of the victim and the audience. This approach lacks ethical standards and can cause harm to people, particularly those who are grieving. In certain situations, the media can reduce the amount of pain that people could experience, by avoiding excessive or prolonged sensationalism *aboutthe crime committed. Therefore, media houses should respect the privacy and dignity of the victims and withstand the temptation of cheap publicity.\nLastly, personal confidential information should not be divulged by the media to avoid committing grave infringements on privacy. Such information covers the medical, financial, marital status, and other intricacies that could potentially harm their reputation when disclosed as headline news. The media should not invade the privacy of individuals in the name of news. For instance, in 2011, a UK newspaper published an article which stated that Ryan Giggs, a renowned Manchester United footballer, had an affair with a former Big Brother Star, Imogen Thomas. The publication resulted in widespread turmoil, when Ryan Giggsvigorously attempted to inhibit the publication of such information considering it to be personal and confidential. He even obtained a court injunction barring the media from publicising his identity as the subject of the article. Similar cases have occurred where celebrities and high-profile people have won cases against the media, holding them liable for infringement of privacy. Therefore, the media should respect the personal space of individuals and refrain from publishing confidential information about them.\nIn conclusion, the media must be prudent and circumspectin its reporting policies for it to balance its key tenets of public interest, commercial viability, and responsibility. There should be mutual cooperation between the media and the government to ensure that sensitive information is not leaked to the public and that the latter is kept informed about issues of public interest.

It is important to consider the sensitivity of those directly impacted by such crimes, such as the victims and their families. Revealing gruesome photos and elements of a crime on mainstream broadcast to a wide audience, even if the aim is to evoke a reaction, can cause desensitisation to such events and may even lead to copycat crimes. The media should exercise caution in disseminating such information in a sensitive manner that does not cause undue distress or sensationalism.\nLastly, personal confidential information should be protected. This includes any details that may be private, such as an individual's home address, phone number or personal health records. The media should not report on such information, unless it is of public interest, and must obtain proper consent before publication to avoid any invasion of privacy. In some cases, the unauthorized disclosure of personal information can even lead to legal action against them.\nIn conclusion, the media plays an instrumental role in shaping public perspectives and upholding democratic principles. However, they have a great responsibility to exercise discretion and avoid any actions that endanger national security, cause undue distress, or infringe upon personal privacy. The media plays a vital part in the public sphere, but such power must come with great responsibility, in which the boundaries of freedom start where it infringes upon other's rights or wellbeing.",

The media should avoid using photos or videos that are too graphic, or details that are too gruesome, as this could lead to desensitisation of the public and potentially cause more harm than good. It is also possible that young people may access these materials, which could result in an erosion of moral integrity and cause psychological harm. Therefore, media professionals should exercise caution when putting content together and adopt policies that are sensitive to the audience's preferences.\nLastly, journalists must ensure that personal confidential information is kept private when reporting on a story. They should respect the privacy of individuals and stick to the ethical values that all media professionals ought to follow. For example, the medical information of a patient should not be publicly disclosed without the person's approval, as this could lead to severe psychological distress. Even if the information is deemed to be of public interest, journalists must uphold their moral obligations and ensure that they do not jeopardise an individual's privacy rights.\nIn conclusion, the media plays a significant role in shaping public perception. As such, the media must be responsible in its conduct and decisions around what information to make public and what to keep confidential. While there is an imperative to provide transparency and access to information, there are equally essential circumstances where discretion is best. The media must balance these considerations in order to ensure that personal privacy and national security are not compromised.

                "the incident, and potentially sensationalising it through graphic visuals or excessive details that might cause emotional distress to the public. The reporting of gruesome details of a crime or accident has a profound effect on the audience. The impact of such reports could influence the mental health and well-being of the viewers or readers, especially those who may have experienced similar tragedies before. Exposure to such information may cause traumatic effects, such as anxiety or depression, which could potentially trigger unhealthy behaviour or even deeper mental health issues. Therefore, it is crucial for the media to abide by ethical standards when reporting on such confidential information, if at all necessary, to create a safer environment for the public to live in.\n\nLastly, the dissemination of confidential personal information without the consent of the concerned party is a breach of privacy. It is essential to maintain the confidentiality of an individual's personal information, such as financial statements, medical records, or private conversations, unless it is necessary for the public interest and a court order or warrant allows it. Infringement on privacy could lead to legal consequences and social disgraces. An example would be the hacking incident in 2015, where Ashley Madison, a dating website for couples looking for extramarital affairs, had its customer data hacked and leaked, causing millions of its users' personal information to be exposed. The hacking of this confidential information resulted in customers being ostracised by society and perceived as immoral, leading to serious consequences such as job loss and negative mental health effects. In light of these cases, the media must be cautious and responsible in ensuring that they do not become the root cause of harm to society or individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, the role of media is significant in shaping the mentality and views of society. Although the media has the liberty to report on any issue, it is essential to balance it with accountability, discretion, and ethical responsibilities. Articles that may reveal confidential details of national security, gruesome or violent information, and personal details should be regulated as failure to do so could lead to ethical and legal ramifications. An accountable media that exercises discretion and responsibility, ultimately fosters a society that is stable and secure.",
                "the situation and over sensationalising the issue. The media must aim to report the facts accurately and within ethical guidelines, avoiding unnecessary graphic details. A recent example of such inappropriate media portrayal was the 2019 Christchurch mosque shootings, in which the shooter livestreamed the attacks on social media. The media was criticised for broadcasting the violent video, which further amplified the tragedy and caused distress to the victims' families and friends. Over-exposure of sensitive information can promote copycat behaviour, and thus the media has a social responsibility to act in a restrained manner.\nLastly, the media should also avoid revealing personal confidential information of individuals which might breach their rights to privacy. In many countries, personal information is guarded by the Personal Data Protection Act, which outlines the strict legal framework within which information can be collected, used, disclosed and stored. The media should respect this legislation to avoid any negative repercussions or consequences. An example would be in the United Kingdom where The Guardian newspaper, amongst other media outlets, was prevented from publishing a confidential story about a public figure and his improprieties. The Guardian published redacted versions of the story but still faced intense backlash from the public who viewed this as an invasion of privacy.\nIn conclusion, while the media is essential in the dissemination of information and influencing public opinion, it should exercise discretion and sensitivity to avoid invading privacy, posing risks to national security or causing harm to individuals. The media should be more vigilant and responsible in portraying sensitive information, taking the necessary steps to strike a balance between public interest and privacy concerns.",

The sensationalising of horrifying crimes that include descriptions of intimate and graphic details could cause severe emotional distress for victims and their families. While reporting the news is essential, the media must handle the news with care as these sensitive and gruesome details could cause unnecessary harm to victims and their families. They must strike a balance between reporting accurate information and respecting the privacy of those involved. Therefore, the media needs to be selective in presenting violent and disturbing images of crimes, which might trigger negative psychological responses among viewers. \n\nFinally, the media should not disclose any personal confidential information, such as medical history, criminal record or any other details concerning personal and family matters. Providing private information related to individuals or groups breaches their rights to confidentiality and could have a detrimental impact on their social and professional lives. For instance, disclosing an employee's medical history could be detrimental to their employment prospects and could lead to discrimination based on health status. Therefore, it is the media's responsibility to handle personal information with confidentiality and respect. \n\nIn conclusion, the media plays a pivotal role in mass communication and has a significant effect on the public's opinions. Nonetheless, media freedom does not grant them the right to be reckless or insensitive. Media professionals carry a responsibility to restrict the circulation of sensitive stories and images, particularly those that could violate personal privacy or cause threats to national security.

When the media covers details of murders, rapes or other violent crimes in a vivid and graphic manner, they might retraumatise the victim's family and cause them to relive the tragedy once again. Hence, the media must exercise sensitivity and empathy while providing such information and should consider the emotional and psychological welfare of their audience. The media should not prioritise sensationalising the details of a potentially violent or malicious act, over the ethical requirement of safeguarding the victim's well-being, and the dignity of the human person.\n\nLastly, the media should also respect and maintain the privacy of individuals. Any public display of an individual's personal life, medical records or financial information without their consent, could have devastating consequences on their well-being. Privacy is an individual's fundamental right. The media should thus ensure that it takes steps to protect individuals' privacy rights by obtaining permission before publishing personal information that could cause harm or disruption to their lives. For instance, reporters who fail to seek permission to publish confidential information about divorce, the scandalous past or medical history of an individual may result in social ostracization and personal harm to the individual. Without privacy protection, individuals may encounter social and psychological stigma and further damage to their dignity and self-esteem.\n\nIn conclusion, the media depends on its ability to report news and disseminate information to the public. However, it should exercise discretion and discernment regarding the types of information it puts forward to the general public. The responsibility of the media extends beyond merely informing the public, as it must adhere to ethical and moral principles, such as respecting privacy rights, protecting national security, and promoting the welfare and sensitivity towards the victims. By maintaining ethical standards and upholding responsibility and discretion, the media can contribute to creating a safe and informed society that respects the basic rights of every citizen.",

News mediums should be mindful of the psychological effect it can have on the victim's family to show gruesome images of murders, suicides or accidents. Furthermore, making public the methods used to commit crimes could also incite imitation crimes by others. An example of the media\u2019s ethical responsibility was demonstrated in the case of the 2019 Christchurch mosque shooting. After the attack, the world saw an outpouring of empathy and support for the victims. However, the media had to exercise restraint in publishing videos of the attack, as this could lead to copycat attacks. The responsible media should be aware of their power to shape public perception and should exercise cautiousness when depicting graphic content that may otherwise have severe long-term repercussions.\nFinally, personal confidential information should also be treated with extreme caution. The media should not invade the privacyof individuals by publicly disclosing their personal information without their prior consent. This is a violation of their basic human right to privacy. However, this does not mean the media should completely disregard exposing personal information in an instance that calls for it, such as a public figure facing charges of a crime. In such cases, the media must weigh up the severity of the information's implications and its relevance to the public interestbefore release.\nTherefore, the media should carefully exercise discretionwhen reporting, and to uphold high standards of journalistic ethics that honours privacy, security and individual dignity.

Personal data like medical records or one's financial information should be considered private. People should not be unwittingly exposed to the masses and sensationalised by the media as it implies an inexcusable invasion of their privacy. The Australian Press Council advocates the minimisation of intrusions into privacy, and it has been suggested that violation of privacy constitutes a form of harassment. Paparazzi photos of celebrities, for example, have led to further intrusions of their personal lives, which is a threat to their emotional well-being. Media should be vigilant in protecting people's social, economic, cultural, and political values.\n\nIn conclusion, the media should play a pivotal role in improving the state of the nation and shaping people's views by providing reliable and relevant information. It is the media's responsibility to suppress information that might threaten national security, disclose people's private details, or cause further trauma and discomfort.

            "human_gen_truncate": "hy, ethical, responsible and accountable to thepublic, it is no surprise that Norway has continued to be the most prosperous country globally in 2014. Hence, accountability and transparency is key, more so than a well managed economy, for any government that wishes to remain in powerin the twenty-first century.\nStill, such a view has drawn flak from some academics even though studies have shown that good governance is correlated with strong transparency, accountability and economic growth. There is a fear that having too much transparency may bring more harm than good as it would impede the policy making process.This view is supported by a University of Pennsylvania Law research paper that stated that full disclosure of the policy making process may inadvertently cause the leakage of firms' trade secrets that were provided to the government. Companies, being fearful of acts that could dent their profits, would then feel less obliged andrestrict the quality and quantity of information that is made available to the government.Therefore, with incomplete and insufficient evidence or knowledge to craft policies, the final legislature could end up being a bane to the country. Thus, the argument against transparency being a key criterion for an efficient government may hold true despite being seemingly counter-intuitive.\nHowever, some intellectuals contend that the main criterion for good government is to uphold and protect individual rights. Such a government helps to protect our freedom to life, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to vote, inter alia. These are essential features that strengthen civil society development, tolerance and respect for others. They hold that incidents such as the FBI's harassment of civil rights leaders, the Army's spying on the anti-war movement in the 1960s, and more recently, in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the passing of the Patriot Act by President Bush and the Republican Congress, have all but severely undermined the citizens' basic rights and freedoms. The U.S. government greatly increased wiretapping and other forms of surveillance of citizens, often without any evidence of any wrongdoing on their part. Thousands of people were secretly detained for months without any charges against them. Suspected terrorists were denied lawyers and the right to a trial. Some suspects were even sent abroad to other countries so they could be tortured. And 2005 and 2006 revealed the existence of extensive domestic spying programs by the National Security Agency and other institutions that are legally forbidden from doing so \u2013a very disturbing development. Nonetheless,while government policies can sometimes threaten our freedoms, our legislatures and courts are also often the most effective avenues for defending and expanding our rights and liberties \u2013for the general good \u2013based on utilitarianism.\nIn conclusion, it is unfair and misguided to posit that the key criterion for good government is how well the economy is managed. It ignores the fact that accurately assessing a government's levels of efficiency and competency is both complicated and perplexing. While a well-managed economy may be able to signal the high degree of competency of a government through the fulfilment of citizens' material well-being, this overly simplistic measure fails to provide a holistic evaluation of the government. Hence, a more superior assessment should also include criteria such as accountability and transparency andto a smaller extent, democratic rights.\nIndeed, countries are increasingly cognisant of the importance of using a multifaceted approach to measure their political monoliths.",

In today's world, it is crucial for governments to prioritize tackling climate change by adopting policies that promote sustainable practices. Governments must prioritize protecting natural resources and mitigating the negative impact their actions and policies might have on the environment. Thus, a good government should invest in renewable energy sources and encourage environmental innovation, which will benefit both spiritual health and economic perspectives.\n\nFinally, a good government needs to promote international cooperation and diplomacy to ensure global peace and stability. A well-managed economy presents opportunities for nations to engage in international relationships and enable more open and equitable trade. International cooperation also involves aid provision and working with other nations to address global issues such as pandemics and refugees. Effective diplomatic relations with the international community can result in agreements that bring about peace and stability, which ultimately advances the interests of the citizens of sovereign states.\n\nTo conclude, while the management of a country's economy is undeniably significant, it is not the be-all and end-all of effective governance. Democracy, accountability, equality, environmental responsibility, and international cooperation are all core principles that any government should strive to uphold.

            "human_gen_truncate": ". This may have led some to believe that life is meaningless and is all for naught. Consequently, the conciliatory role of religion becomes increasingly important as it offers a psychological solution by elucidating the constructs of heaven and an afterlife that provide solace and comfort amid such depressing frames of mind. Hence, despite its apparent flaws, the emotional element of religion is needed more so than ever in today's rapidly evolving world plagued with insecurities.\nFurthermore, many religions seek to provide social support for the underclass. In spite of the massive strides made by the global community in alleviating absolute poverty,most notably the drastic decrease of over 70 per cent since 1978, many around the world still live in relative poverty. This is evident in a 2006 United Nations study that found the top one per cent of the world controls more wealth than the bottom 95% altogether. To these people struggling in the quagmire of poverty, religion plays a pivotal social support role in these pressing times. For instance, the Sikhs openly welcome visitors to their Gurdwaras, their place of worship. Many homeless non-Sikhs often turn up at these places looking for food and shelter, to the extent that over five thousands meals were served in the 250 Gurdwaras in 2013 in Britain alone. Additionally, most religions stipulate that their followers should care for the economic well-being of those in their communities through acts of charity. For instance, a central concern in the Qur'an is the treatment of the poor, marginalized, and disadvantaged. Islamic teachings enjoin all Muslim adults, who are financially able, to make donations and pay an obligatory alms tax of a percentage of their assets . In fact, Muslims had been named as being the most generous in the United Kingdom in 2012, as they donated more than the Christians, Jews and Atheists. This highlights the indispensability of religion which provides an additional social safety net alongside government aid and given the current economic turmoil arising from the Eurozone crisis, such unconditional help has proven to be especially invaluable. Thus, from a realistic point of view, there is a more urgent need for religion in today's world.\nIn conclusion, while religion may have its shortcomings, but so is every human construct. The arguments outlined earlier have illuminated the far-reaching merits of religion, specifically the emotional and social assistance religion can offer in today's globalised world inundated with unprecedented complexityand dynamic competition. Therefore, dispelling religion for its flaws does not do justice to these beneficial attributes that are in fact worthy of respect and appreciation. However, to avoid a head-on confrontation between science and religion in search of worldly answers, it is important to cultivate wisdom instead of following one's faith blindly. Therefore, as long as pious people interpret their religious principles in the context of their own cultural background and take responsibility for their faith in the environment they inhabit by adapting to the changing societal norms and expanding academia, religion would continue to provide more solutions than problems in today's world.",

In today's world, there are numerous issues such as climate change, political instability, and social inequality that can leave people feeling helpless and disheartened. Religion can offer a sense of hope and purpose in the face of adversity, inspiring individuals to take action and work towards a better future.\n\nFinally, religion can promote interfaith harmony and understanding.

This has been especially relevant in this age of globalisation, where individuals may feel lost amidst the plethora of choices and cultures present. By providing a sense of identity and belongingness, religion helps to combat the sense of isolation that one may feel, hence reducing the chances of them indulging in radical ideologies.\nIn conclusion, while there are significant drawbacks and downsides to religious beliefs, one cannot dismiss the beneficial aspects that it provides. Religion might be the key to instilling strong moral values, providing emotional support, and promoting social cohesion. Furthermore, it is essential to recognise that religion itself does not pose a danger, but rather the misuse and radicals who exploit it to justify abhorrent actions that do. Hence, the solution lies in reforming the religious institutions and promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding to combat religious fanaticism. Religions, like scientific theories, must evolve to keep up with changing times and remain relevant, but one cannot deny that they providea vital foundation for moral and social cohesion, thus warranting their existence in our modern world.",

However, religion provides the comfort of an ultimate purpose in life, a purpose that supersedes individual existence. For instance, Hinduism and Buddhism both promote the idea of karma, whereby one's actions and deeds decide one's fate in the afterlife. The concept of karma serves as a moral compass, helping individuals become better people by leading a virtuous life. Thus, religion provides a deeper meaning to one's life, offering an emotional lifeline and hope in times of despair.\nIn conclusion, while there may be negative connotations associated with religion, and despite the persisting arguments made against religious beliefs and doctrines, one must not overlook its potential to serve as a source of emotional and spiritual inspiration and support. Rather than seeing religion as a burden, the world should place emphasis on the positive aspects of religion while acknowledging the shortcomings of some of its practices. Instead of discrediting religion as an obsolete social construct that has been superannuated by modernity's very own extremes, it is more urgent that we come to terms with the eclectic traditions, customs, and cultures that come attached to it.

Similarly, Christianity believes in an afterlife in heaven or hell, while Islamic eschatology promotes their own version of Judgement day. By having some understanding and belief in such doctrines, individuals can form a sense of community and belonging, essentially overcoming feelings of isolation and meaninglessness.\n\nIn conclusion, religion's relevance in today's modernised world is complex and multifaceted. Although religion is susceptible to being used as a tool of violence and fanaticism, it still provides a sense of morality and belonging to most individuals. Religion serves as a source of emotional support and guidance that acts as a bulwark against the bleakness of a meaningless and mundane existence.

While religions and their fanatical followers have often been accused of promoting violence and hampering scientific progress, it is also essential to acknowledge the positive aspects that religion provides, such as moral guidance, emotional and social support, and the promise of an afterlife.

As a first step, the Chinese people have clearly understood that prudent environmental policies depend on open and accurate environmental data. As a result, the Chinese media \u2013the Communist government's mouthpiece \u2013has been fervently producing eye-opening, in-depth investigative reports on a myriad of environmental problems from air pollution to water pollution. This evidently shows how critical is the people's voice in the piece of action in saving the shared environment.\nMoreover, with the support of capablegovernment leadership, technology has immenselymitigated the dire effects of the epidemics that proliferate in the world today. Many of the diseasestoday are extremely malignant, having a fast rate of transmission and alarming levels of casualties as a result.Furthermore, it has translated into a heavier burden on an individual in their medical cost and a decrease in labour productivity should the disease spread to many people. For example, a scourge of the world is smallpox where an estimated 300 million people died from it in the 20th century alone.Such a death toll vividly shows the severity ofthe disease outbreak that can threaten the survival of mankind if no proper safeguards are put in place. Fortunately, technology has given rise to many new vaccines that manage to successfully contain and eradicate the host of contagions that have occurred throughout over the last century. For instance, Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Switzerland's Cytos Biotechnology AG announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial with their H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate based on Cytos' proprietary bacteriophage Qbeta virus-like particle (VLP) technology where the safety and immunogenicity of this novel vaccine candidate and its potential to protect against H1N1 influenza infection will be evaluated. Although such timely medical treatments have been paramount, the aversion of an apocalyptic crisis would have not been successful without the effective government administration manifested in the use of contingency plans.At the end of the 1960s, while smallpox was still endemic in Africa and Asia, vaccination campaigns, surveillance and prevention measures aimed to contain epidemic hotspots and to better inform affected populations made huge unprecedented contributions to surmounting the epidemic. Through all these efficacious strategies and collaborative efforts of countries,smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1980 and is the first disease to have been fought on a global scale.This sterling result has evidently shown how imperative is effective publicplanning in the medical field which ultimately led to the complete eradication of the malady.\nIn conclusion, while technology is an important key to solve major crisis in the world, it is no panacea.We have to rely on other equallyvital elementssuch as societal influence and competentgovernment administration to bring sustainable answersto the pressing world issues of modern day.",

Moreover, technology has made it easier for educators to track student progress, and provide timely feedback, and tailor their teaching methods to meet individual student needs.\n\nAnother major issue that technology is helping to solve is poverty. Technology has enabled the creation of new jobs, increased productivity and facilitated access to information. The development of new technologies has allowed for the creation of new and better-paying jobs across different industries. Moreover, online platforms such as e-commerce and digital platforms are expanding entrepreneurship opportunities, especially for those living in developing countries.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of technology cannot be overstated. It has brought with it immense benefits that have made our lives much easier and more convenient. In this essay, we have discussed how technology has helped society to address some of the major challenges faced by mankind today. From healthcare to environmental degradation, to education and poverty, technology has had a profound impact on our world.

As such, it is clear that societal and cultural influences, such as public opinion, can play a significant role in driving progress towards a sustainable future. Moreover, effective government administration is equally crucial in complementing technology in tackling global crises. A capable government can effectively enforce regulations and policies to reduce carbon emissions and support the development of green technologies. Also, it can lead by example and spearhead sustainable practices in its operations and in the society at large. Therefore, rather than relying purely on technology to solve the world's problems, a holistic approach integrating various factors such as government policy and public opinion is ideal.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has demonstrated its ability to tackle global crises, it cannot alone solve these problems. The complex and widespread nature of environmental and societal issues requires a multi-pronged approach that includes positive cultural and societal influences, effective governance and properly regulated technology. All these factors play complementary roles and can only work when they are integrated towards a common goal of achieving sustainable development and a greener future for generations to come.",

This collaboration between governments, citizens, and technology can create a more sustainable future. \n\nFurthermore, technology alone may not be adequate in solving these challenges if it is not complemented by a strong and effective government administration. In order for technology to work at its utmost efficiency, policies must be in place to encourage investment and usage of breakthrough technologies. For example, the United Arab Emirates government's development strategy has placed an emphasis on incubatingand fostering innovation ecosystems in order to develop new technologies that can improve the quality of people's lives. In combination with government aid and support, innovations have flourished such as the world's largest solar farm in Abu Dhabi, which provides enough power to fulfill the needs of more than 20,000 households in the United Arab Emirates. These efforts reveal how vital it is for technology to work in conjunction with governments to effectively mitigate and resolve existing problems. \n\nUltimately, while technology has proven to be a powerful tool in dealing with some of our contemporary challenges, it cannot solve these issues alone. It must be coupled with strong societal and cultural foundations as well as effective government administration to guarantee its success. The holistic approach in which problems are handled by addressing the root causes and considering every factor involved, is a better stance. As such, success in addressing these multi-faceted environmental challenges can be achieved only if there is concerted and collaborative effort across all sectors through the integration of economic, social, and technological factors.",

In other words, for technology to be fully effective, governments, societies, and individuals must work together to ensure a greener and more sustainable future for our planet.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has been crucial in solving many of the environmental crises that our world faces today, it is only one part of the solution to these profound problems. The responsibility lies with everyone to work in collaboration with one another to address these issues holistically if we are to leave behind a world that is safe and healthy for future generations. As Singaporeans, we should recognise the need to play our part and take pro-environmental actions in our everyday lives such as choosing to recycle, reducing our carbon footprint, and advocating for policies that protect our environment. By doing so, we can pave the way for a sustainable future, not just for ourselves, but for all living beings on this earth.",

The public's outcry against the smog-choked cities has led the government to take action, closing down polluting factories and implementing regulations to control industrial emissions. Technology, without the backing of the public's desire for change, would be rendered ineffective in solving environmental problems. \n\nAnother area where technology is insufficient on its own is in combating global terrorism. While new technological advances such as drones and advanced surveillance systems have proven effective in thwarting potential terrorist attacks, they have not been able to eradicate the root of terrorism itself. Terrorism often arises from longstanding social, economic, and political issues. Therefore, without addressing these issues, technology's ability to combat terrorism is limited. History has shown that forceful methods can only do so much and that root causes must be resolved to truly eradicate terrorism. \n\nIn conclusion, technology has indeed played a key role in remedying some of the major crises that have plagued our world. However, it is not a panacea and cannot solve all of the problems on its own. A multidisciplinary approach is necessary, with technology being only one part of the solution. Successful outcomes require strong cultural and societal influences, effective government administration as well as the active participation of its citizens.

This shows that technology alone cannot solve the environmental problems we face. Rather, it is the collective action of individuals and society as a whole, through various methods such as protests, petitions and advocacy, that can effect a lasting and positive change. Furthermore, having strong and effective government administration is also crucial in effectively curbing the many problems we face today. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic would have been much worse if not for the proactive measures taken by governments such as border controls and mandatory quarantine measures. Technology such as tracking apps and contact tracing have also played an important role in stopping the spread of the virus. Yet, without the coordination of governments to implement these measures, the technology itself would be rendered useless.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology plays a pivotal role in solving various problems, we should not solely rely on it to address the many issues that plague our world. Rather, we need a multi-faceted approach that combines technological advances with active involvement from organisations, society and governments. Whether it be addressing environmental problems related to global warming and deforestation or combating the deadly pandemics of our age, we must work together to create a bright and sustainable future for our world.",

In addition to widespread environmental activism, technology may also face other constraints such as economic and political constraints which could undermine its efficacy. This is because some technology may require extensive financial backing which many governments may not be able to provide. Consequently, without a strong and effective government administration, valuable environmental technologies may not be deployed as they should.\n\nFurthermore, technology alone may not be sufficient in solving societal problems such as racism, gender inequality, and poverty. These problems arise from deeply ingrained societal attitudes which can only be changed through a concerted effort led by groups such as non-governmental organisations (NGOs), social reformers and local communities. Technology may be useful in alleviating these societal problems, but social reform, legislative measures and policy changes need to be brought together to ensure effective and lasting change. For example, organisations like the World Economic Forum and the United Nations have playeda pivotal role in leveraging technology and policy in support of gender equality and inclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has undoubtedly been an instrumental force in solving many of the current environmental problems, it will not be sufficient in achieving a sustainable future alone. Effective governance, strong advocacy, and collaboration between interested parties will be vital in complementing technology to address these issues more comprehensively. It is only through this concerted effort that we can truly achieve a sustainable and equitable future for our planet.",

Similarly, cultural and social norms can play a crucial role in improving the environment. As technology continues to present new green opportunities like energy-efficient buildings, electric cars and recycling programs, the society must also be receptive and supportive towards such a move. This is where our government plays a vital role in promoting a culture of environmental consciousness. It can promote the use of energy-efficient products by providing incentives or tax breaks to companies, it can invest in renewable energy sources such as solar panels or wind turbines, or even launch public awareness campaigns about the benefits of recycling. Such cultural and societal norms can create an ecosystem that is truly conducive towards using technology to address environmental concerns. \n\nIn summation, while we cannot deny that technology can catalyse our efforts in combating environmental issues, it cannot do it alone. The combination of effective governance, social activism, and cultural shifts will prove to be indispensable if we are to truly make an impact in preserving our planet.",

This goes to show that technology alone cannot solve environmental issues, it requires the government and citizens to work in unison, thus complementing the power of technology. \n\nFurthermore, technology may not always be the best solution, especially when it comes to countering cultural differences between different nations. For example, while technology may be used to better detect and counteract the spread of terrorism, it is still only a tool that requires the cooperation of human intervention, which in turn requires an understanding of social nuances and cultural differences in order to be successful. Even with the most advanced technology, being able to understand and talk to people from different cultural backgrounds may be the key to unmasking terrorists or alleviating their grievances. \n\nIn conclusion, technology certainly plays a vital role in aiding the world today, especially in environmental and health-related issues. However, it is not the be-all and end-all solution, as it has to be complemented by governmental and societal interventions while navigating cultural and societal differences. Ultimately, collective efforts and pragmatic solutions remain the best way to overcome the crises of the 21st century.",

This has also spurred on industries to be more sustainable and environmentally-friendly as the demand for environmentally-conscious products and services surge. Therefore, it is not just technology that solves environmental issues, but also the wider social and cultural practices that promote environmentalism in our society.\n\nFurthermore, technology alone cannot solve many social problems that are deeply rooted in culture. For instance, violent extremism or radicalisation that has caused widespread destruction and chaos in different parts of the world. Technology can indeed be used as a tool to create awareness and counter-terrorism efforts, with the use of social media, surveillance and advanced technology. However, to fully address such a complex issue requires a multifaceted approach, such as promoting racial and religious harmony, social development, inclusive politics and inclusive economic opportunities. Many of these efforts have to come organically from the affected societies, groups and people themselves. Technology alone cannot address the cultural and societal root causes that may give rise to certain societal dysfunction and crises.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology can indeed play an important role in resolving many of the environmental and social problems we face in the world today, it should be recognised that technology alone is not enough to completely eradicate these issues permanently.

For instance, in Singapore, ever since the National Library Board (NLB) has launched the new Library@Orchard in 2014, it has attracted many users, especially young peopleas it serves as a courtyard for youths to congregate and its heavy emphasis on design, together with state of the arts digital access to e-books, is able to compete with commercialised establishments such as Starbucks. Thus, it clearly shows how physical libraries are advancing to keep in touch with the current trends to make themselves evermore relevant in our lives.\nFurthermore, libraries serve as a refuge for citizens who are burdened by their work demands. A libraryis still a sanctuarythat preserves the peace and quiet atmosphere it has, making it a suitable destination for many to relax. In the midstof the heavy workloads and cutthroat competition in today's globalised society, many turn to libraries to seek comfort and solace in books and allow their imagination to run wild or live an alternate reality and discover new hobbies. For example, in The Sacramento Public Library in California, is one of a few dozen libraries in the country to embrace the \"maker movement\", in which people use technology, such as robotics and 3-D printing, to create handicrafts and other objects. The management believes that libraries are now becoming hands-on creative hubs, places where people can learn new crafts and experiment with technology such as 3-D printers. This not only helps people to detach their minds off their hectic schedule, it also helps to shelter them from the pressures of our modern day society which is heavily concerned with productivity and gains in material wealth. Therefore, I believe that libraries are cardinalplaces thatallow people to soothe their minds and discover their new strengths andinterests.\nFinally, people have recognised that libraries play an imperative role in preserving a country's heritage today. A library can also be considered a national monument that helps to safeguarda nation's heritage and shows how a country has advanced and developed throughout the years. Many bemoan the demolishment of these iconic buildings that helped people form a collective history and define their very own identities. Demolishing it to the pave the way for urban development would be seen as ripping away a considerable aspect of a country's identity. The old National Library in Singapore is a prime example of how such symboliclandmarks had to make way for urban development which received much public dissent in 2004.

Studies have shown that if we are to continue relying on crude oil as our main source of energy at this rate, there will only be enough for 42 years, implying that we may be facing a severe depletion of this precious energyresource. It is hence essential for us to uncover new and innovative means to obtain renewable energy. Renewable energy is important in sustaining mankind's economic development and environmental preservation. Renewable energy, by definition, is inexhaustible in contrast to fossil fuels, which will eventually run out. This is a pivotal point to consider in the light of our steadily growing population size facing diminishing fossil fuel supplies as the rate of depletion significantly outpaces the rate of discovery and extraction. Hence renewable energy would be a more desirable alternative to fossil fuels. Another major benefit of renewable energy is that such forms of energy have limited environmental impact. Good These clean forms of energy generate minimal pollution and emissions, if not at all. Good On the contrary, the refinement process of crude oil produces many solid toxic wastes such as mercury and other heavy metals, and the burning of fossil fuels often discharges arsenic and lead into surface waters while both release a substantial amount of pollutants into the air. These pollutants cause respiratory illnesses and deaths in humans, and give rise to acid rain, which erodes infrastructure and destroys fragile eco-systems. These harmful effects are very detrimental to our economic development and environment, greatly hampering global productivity as a consequence. Therefore,it would be wise to focus on the research on sources of renewable energy.\nLast but not least, another important area of research should be targeted at the issues of environmental degradation caused by pollution and global climate change. Increasing technological advancement has also yielded greater environmental damage in the form of pollutant emissions, which have long-lasting effects on our commonly shared environment. For example, the increasing mechanization and commercialization of agricultural produce causes water pollution and disrupts eco-systems and aquatic life. Besides, pollutants emitted from deforestation contribute to global warming, which could escalate into a environmental crisis if not properly managed and dealt with. It also causes soil erosion that results in land degradation. These are pressing environmental issues that can majorly impact mankind and his future. Thus, it is vital for us to prioritise scientific research in existing and potential environmental issues and the ways to alleviate them. Therefore,I feel that in the next decade, environmental preservation should be one of the key priorities of scientific research, especially in an increasingly industrialized world.\nIn conclusion, the three key areas of scientific research to be prioritized in the next decade are the research and development on food genetics, renewable energy, as well as environmental sustainability and protection. By simultaneously targeting all three areas, the aggregate impact may be substantially greater than the individual impacts since the benefits are mutually reinforcing, such as the use of renewable energy would also help to improve the problem of environmental degradation. This should be the top mandate in the next decade, where technology will continue to flourish alongside with the exponential increase of population, in pursuit of sustainable future progress and growth.",

This is because the amount of these non-renewable resources that the earth possesses is limited and will eventually be depleted. Therefore, renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydroenergy hold the key to the future of energy generation and supply. It is important that immense research be done in the development of these technologies to aid in the transition to using more sustainable energy sources. Additionally, innovations that enhance the efficiency of energy conversion and storage should also be explored to ensure that the amount of energy produced meets global population needs. Hence, renewable energy should be one of the key areas of scientific research in the next decade to ensure sustainable energy supply for future generations.\nFinally, the importance of environmental preservation cannot be overemphasized in the face of increasing population size and rapid urbanization rates. In the next decade, scientific research should be prioritized on finding solutions to environmental problems that affect us, such as climate change, air pollution, waste management and deforestation. This is because our actions today have an impact on the environment and our future. To sustainably improve our quality of living, we must take care of the environment that we inhabit. Through scientific research, we can find sustainable solutions to reduce our environmental footprints and improve our living conditions.

Thus, embryonic stem cell research should not be viewed as synonymous with murder but contribution to invaluable scientific research that would push the boundaries of our stock of knowledge in alleviating human suffering from illnesses. With such clear benefits that science can provide to our society, it is hence myopic and improvident to denounce it as a threat and hamper its progress.\nMoreover, a viable solution to the issue of food scarcity among the rapidly expanding world population might lie in genetic modification. Genetic scientists have developed crops that are hardier and more resistant to pestilence. These advantageous traits are especially beneficial at a time when the world is experiencing harsher and more extreme climates precipitated by destructive human activities that have resulted in food shortage in many regions. Scorching temperatures and scarce rainfall have left large swathes of the United States in drought, withthe 'breadbasket states', such as Iowa and Indiana, among the worst affected. The extreme weather conditions have wreaked havoc with the nation's crop production, particularly maize (corn) and soya beans. Given that the country is the world's top exporterof maize and one of the largest growers of soya beans,the drought has huge ramifications for global food supplies, but science is providing the much-needed help. Many scientists are trying to unravel the complex crop genetics that allows these crops to tolerate environmental extremes, and they hope to use conventional breeding methods to create varieties that perform even better. There has already been some success with sorghum, which has shown improved productivity in drought conditions that occur late in the growing season in temperate and tropical environments.

Therefore, democracy in its raw form may not often be the best as it may cause political parties to lose sight of its actual aims and instead become a popularparty through deception to win its way into government. As such, it often results in the inability of the government to fulfil its promises given at the rallies.\nSecondly, although the elected individuals are mandated to represent their supporters and decide on policies that will benefit the country, they are ultimately still humans and thus are equally vulnerable to the same human temptations. As such they may become corrupt and implement venal policies for their personal selfish gains. An example is the previous president of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovych. He allegedly misappropriated part of Ukraine's savings to build his lavish mansion, which houses golden taps and a collection of motorcycles and cars worth millions of dollars. Up till now, he still insists that he funded his house with his savings, even though he merely earns fifteen thousand pounds annually. This notorious example has showcased the immense corruption that can possibly occur, where politicians entrenched in power may abuse the public trust and loyalty to their own favour. Thus, even if morally upright politicians are democratically elected, they may eventually succumb to financial temptations and often render democracy not the best political system.\nFinally, in many democratic countries today, many outcomes are premeditated by the political representatives while feedback and open discussions are often not sought from the people. Thus this has increasingly raised doubts on the level of \"democracy\" in a\"democratic society\". For example, in Singapore, there is a piece of legislation that was recently enacted which is often said to be a violation of Singaporeans' freedom of speech. This legislation is called the Online Licensing Framework, where this framework requires websites that report on Singapore news with a readership of at least 50,000 over a period of a month to pay for a license to continue operating. Furthermore, they have to obey any notices received from the government and take down any articles deemed as untruthful. This led to many Singaporeans, especially the anti-PAP (the incumbent ruling political party of Singapore) activists to express even greater dissatisfaction with the government. The distaste for this legislation stems from the factthat government is trying to limit the content Singaporeans get to read, thereby effectively diminishing the ability of Singaporeans to post their criticisms of the government. Therefore, democratic governments today, may run the risk of getting too much power which could lead to them unknowingly robbing the citizens of their rights. As such, democracy may not be generally the best.\nIn conclusion, even though democracy allows the people to have greater say in how their country is run, there are several unintended byproductsof the democratic systems due to the insufficient knowledge of the population, the shortcomings of human nature and the ability of politicians toabuse their power.

Therefore, democracy may sometimes be perceived as a system that is more based on popularity rather than reason, which may result in a lack of intelligence in the policies chosen.\nAnother glitch that is commonly cited with democracy is the fact that the candidates who have the wealth and resources are placed in a better position to win elections than those who lack the resources. This gap is most evident in many developing countries where the poor could be just as capable as the rich to govern if only they were given a chance. Therefore, it could be inferred that democracy may sometimes lead to the subversion of democracy itself.\nDespite these challenges, democracy remains the most widely accepted system of governance. As technology advances and literacy rates continue to rise, more individuals are becoming open to voicing their opinions on political issues and shaping policies that are formulated by their representatives. The widespread access to the internet has further democratized participation by providing platforms where members of the populace can discuss politics and voice out their opinions. All in all, democracy is a system that must be guarded and protected if we are to continue enjoying its benefits.

In the U.S., recent events showed how people with largely opposite views could become entrenched on one side of the political spectrum, creating a division within the country that is hard to bridge. Similarly, political decisions made by the government, even if it is populist and for the benefit of the majority, could incite anger and resentment from those who are not in favour of it. This could create an \"us vs them\" mentality that could ultimately lead to the breakdown of social harmony.\nIn conclusion, democracy, while still the most popular form of government around the world, is not without its challenges and limitations.

Elected representatives have access to privileged information and resources that are not available to the general public. By lacking access to these resources, the general public is inhibited from adequately participating in the democratic process. This challenge can be overcome by countering it with supplementary measures such as transparency in governance and comprehensive education programs, which enable the masses to understand and engage in matters of governance.\nTo conclude, while democracy has its flaws, it is still the best political system we have, provided we address its limitations with complementary measures. By instituting policies that provide accurate and objective education, establish an independent media, and encourage transparency and accountability in governance, we can ensure that democracy operates efficiently and serves the populace effectively.

This is a weakness of democracy where short-term thinking may dominate long-term thinking which would ultimately put a country's development and growth at risk. Therefore, in order to ensure the government's policies and decisions are based on proper research and evaluation, a democracy needs a strong and independent media. This is because the media has the power to expose any inadequacies or corruption in a government. A strong media can hold the government accountable and ensure that all policy decisions are properly scrutinized before they are implemented.\nAnother potential weakness of democracy is that it assumes that every citizen can make an informed decision. In Singapore, for example, the vast majority of people are well-educated and have access to the internet. This means that people are likely to be able to make rational decisions when voting. However, in other countries, this may not be the case. Many people may not have access to the internet or may not have a formal education. Yet, they still get to vote. In such cases, their inability to make informed decisions may undermine democracy. One solution to this problem is to invest in education. By ensuring that every citizen has access to basic education, it becomes easier for them to make informed decisions when they vote. Furthermore, governments can provide public access to unbiased information about political parties and policies. This would help every citizen to form an opinion based on factual information rather than hearsay or propaganda.\nIn conclusion, democracy is the preferred system of governance for most countries. Its strengths include the fair representation of people's interests and the ability to hold governments accountable. However, it also has weaknesses such as the potential for short-term thinking, the limited knowledge of some of the voters and the need for a strong and independent media.

Due to such risks, the people who get elected from these elections may not always have the mandate of the people to lead them adequately. One remedy to address this issue would be to implement regulations that prevent political parties from accepting financial donations from vested groups such as big corporations or political personalities.\nMoreover, democracy may lead to an unnecessary prolongation of decision-making processes since a majority of the citizens have to first be consulted before making any significant calls. This is particularly troublesome when a quick decision must be made, perhaps in response to an imminent threat or crisis. Countries such as Germany and Japan have dealt with this issue by amending their respective constitutions to concentrate power in the hands of the executive branch and reduce the option for gridlock caused by the legislative or judicial branches, by allowing executive decisions to carry considerable weight in dire circumstances. Such a model is known as semi-presidentialism, which combines features of presidential and parliamentary systems of government.\nIn conclusion, democracy is a political system that allows for the fair representation of all citizens, and it should be safeguarded as much as possible. However, democracy is not without flaws, and that is why complementary measures should be put in place to address its issues adequately. This means that government should work towards ending the influence of money in politics, making decisions in a relatively short time when it is necessary, and allowing a considerable role for the president in times of crisis. It is essential that we appreciate and continuously reinforce democracy as a means of ensuring a fair and just society.",

Furthermore, the political instability that results from frequent changes in the government gives an impression of uncertainty to foreign investors, hence slowing the rate of foreign investment into the country.\nMoreover, democracy can be problematic when the population is uninformed, uneducated or heavily swayed by media propaganda. In countries where the populace is not highly educated or exposed to a wide range of media, the quality of their decision-making may not be the best. This is mainly because they would lack information crucial to the rational evaluation of arguments presented by various political parties. In certain nations, the populace may be so polarised that they might only consume media sources that present skewed information that suits their political affiliations or target demographic. These groups may not view unbiased statistical analysis or other facts contradicting their beliefs as factual or valid. Such a scenario would result in the electorate not being able to evaluate policy claims rationally, hence impeding the ability of democracy to function optimally.\nIn addition, political representatives may have personal agendas not beneficial to the majority, leading them to make choices that do not align with the general good of the populace. This is commonly seen when political parties focus more on winning the upcoming elections by promising future benefits that they cannot deliver after assuming power. With the power of incumbency- being that most of the key personnel that could influence political decisions are within their purview- it is possible for the representative to keep a tight grip on power, ultimately benefitting only themselves and their close associates.\nIt is, therefore, evident that democracy has its flaws. However, these can be mitigated and democracy can be made even better for everyone. For instance, the problem of limited knowledge can be addressed by providing the populace access to unbiased information and by enlightening them on fundamental issues concerning the government and the country, such as policy implementation. Additionally, proper electoral reforms would allow the minority to have a say in governance, promoting fairness and equity among citizens. In conclusion, democracy is indeed a laudable idea, but it needs to be practised with some modifications to prevent problems that arise from uninformed, selfish leaders and an uninformed electorate.",

            "prompt": "Is foreign intervention justified?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "c intervention almost exclusively comes with strings attached. This can be seen in how the World Bank's attempts to intervene in African nations in the 1990s through micro finance programmes have largely failed to achieve success. To the contrary, they have crippled these economies by eliciting in debt collections over twenty billion USD per anum. Similarly, Greece was crippled by punitive sovereign debt that deprived its central bank and government the ability to flex its fiscal muscle, precluding its ability to exercise fiscal autonomy. This was because other countries had the contractual upper hand in demanding for their money back. Second, even when intervention itself comes with no strings attached, countries subject themselves to the diplomatic whims and fancies of the interventionists, hence mortgaging future economic growth for short lived boosts in economic performance. Angola watched itself give up sixty percent of oil assets to Chinese multinationals following their intervention in the Angolan economy whereas Yemen watched its economy crumble at the hands of the United States that suspended all USAID intervention programmes on the eve of the first Gulf War when the Yemeni ambassador voted against a United States resolution advocating for military intervention in Iraq in the Security Council. Third, ignorance of the intervening countries may inadvertently debilitate the economies they intervene in, even in the rare instances where there are few or no strings attached. What seemed like benevolent assistance, US intervention in the Guyana economy crippled it when US products displaced the local market mechanism by introducing superior but cheaper US products, thereby driving local Guyanese products out of the market, and forcing local producers to poverty. Such was also the case in Mozambique. What is known to economists as the 'Dutch Disease Effect' further erodes the competitiveness of countries intervened in, crippling them in the long run. This highlights how economic intervention, due to its nature of conditionality, its potential for diplomatic leverage, and the ignorance of the intervening party largely debilitates the economies they seek to nurture, rendering them indefensible.\n Lastly, intervention of any form on the supranational level where countries, under set international framework, intervene in others with or without consent cannot be condoned due to its lack of accountability and its entrapment in rigid bureaucracy maligned by political self interest. Such factors have been noted to deteriorate the very conditions intervention may seek to address. Lack of oversight in organisations with the authority to intervene, like the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has ironically led to war crimes in conflicts they were mobilised to dissipate. Cases of UN Peacekeeper brutality and even the rape of uninvolved civilians by parties in such a position of trust, a gross abrogation of the commitments undertaken to International Humanitarian Law under the Geneva Conventions, is not unheard of. This form of coalition intervention dramatically reduces the ability to effect necessary oversight as it makes the apportioning of blame and the application of punitive measures to any one party overtly difficult. This can serve to exacerbate already tense situations, as was the case with UN intervention in East Timor. Furthermore, supranational intervention of any one or few countries into another under international framework inspires a false sense of confidence in the international community of the ability of said intervention to be effective. As evidenced by various instances of political gridlock due to competing objectives and self-interest, such faith is misplaced. It both deters other forms of effective conflict resolution and itself fails to achieve any results compounding the issues faced in the country needing intervention. Such was the case in Rwanda where neighbouring Uganda decided not to intervene despite repeated calls by the incumbent government as the UN Mission in Rwanda had already been deployed. However, when the world needed it, political gridlock in the Security Council precluded the authorisation for troops already stationed in Rwanda to mobilise and act; Peacekeepers had to helplessly watch as Hutu turned on Tutsi and slaughtered one another on the bloodied streets of Kigali. This serves to show that supranational intervention both lacks much needed oversight and is subjected to bureaucratic inefficiency amidst political self-interest. It is thus that intervention is unjustifiable - far from solving the problems of other countries, it either directly contributes to them or otherwise deters the implementation of effective solutions, while itself being ineffectual.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention of most forms, except for humanitarian responses to disasters, compounds the very problems they seek to resolve and thus cannot be justified on both principle and practical grounds. This then begs the question - why does intervention continue to exist today, and how else can the international community respond? To address the former, experts in the field of international relations posit that it is but a way to consolidate political clout, present themselves as bastions of ideals such as democracy, and for large powers to satiate their modern day \"white saviour complex\", thereby pinning motivations behind intervention on self interest, as opposed to altruism. To address the later, perhaps there is no ideal way to resolve issues in the hotchpotch of international relations - for saying that intervention is unjustifiable is not to say other methods of conflict resolution and nation building are more effective. Perhaps this conundrum is best summarised by the sagacious words of Friedrich Nietschze who mused on the idea of moral relativism. He opined that to any problem - \"There is your way, and there is mine. As for the right way, it does not exist.\"",

For instance, the US intervention in Iraq in 2003 led to immense loss of life for both the citizens of Iraq and the military personnel who were sent to the country.\n\nAnother negative consequence of foreign intervention is the unintended consequences that it can have. Military intervention might lead to a change in government but not always for the better. A new government might not be stable enough to provide the necessary support and services, which exacerbates the problems and the suffering of the citizens. The 2011 intervention by NATO in Libya led to the downfall of the Gaddafi regime, but also created a power vacuum, leading to political instability and economic turmoil.\n\nFurthermore, foreign intervention can be criticized for being based on self-interest rather than humanitarian concerns. Countries might get involved in other countries' affairs simply to advance their own interests, such as securing resources or expanding their influence. The Western interventions in the Middle East during the 20th century are often criticized for being driven by the desire for oil rather than for humanitarian reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention can be justified but only in certain circumstances. While it might be necessary to protect human rights or to stop an oppressive regime, it can lead to unintended consequences and increased violence. As citizens and leaders, it is our responsibility to carefully weigh the pros and cons of foreign intervention and make thoughtful decisions based on humanitarian concerns rather than self-interest.",

                "c intervention, largely, is an indirect way of imposing political control over another country by another. Second, most international aid programs to developing countries come attached with conditions that stymie their organic economic growth. Countries may be forced to devalue their currencies or liberalise trade, contracting their local industries, to attract more foreign investment. This leads to increased international debt, economic insecurity, and long-term stagnation. For instance, the World Bank implemented structural adjustment programs in African countries in the 80s and 90s as part of a larger plan to address indebtedness. However, this created a cycle of debt and malnourishment that African countries had to fight against for over three decades to recover from. Even if countries do eventually rise from these programmes, this comes with the caveat of assuming the economic models of their colonisers, rendering any claims of gains in economic independence void. As President Julius Nyerere of Tanzania warned in a 1981 UN address, \"foreign aid is a demand for slavery\". These reasons illustrate that foreign financial intervention is unjustifiable as it harms the economic development of the countries it seeks to serve.\n\nIn conclusion, while humanitarian intervention in times of crisis has been beneficial, any form of unauthorised intervention - political, military, or economic - is largely harmful and unjustifiable. The argument that intervention is an affable policy that can guarantee international security, prevent political conflict, or promote democratic values is misguided and untenable. Such policies have left many states in turmoil for decades, if not centuries after intervention. To promote and encourage economic and political cooperation between states instead is a more sustainable and sensible strategy.",
                "c intervention further facilitates neo-colonialist practices and creates a dependency and vulnerability that developing countries will struggle with post-intervention. The case of structural adjustment measures imposed by IMF and World Bank on developing countries proves this, as countries were required to open up their economies to international competition and privatise state-owned assets with the risk of loss of national industries and increased levels of inequality. As the case of Yugoslavia proves, economic sanctions can also serve as a precursor to military intervention, leaving the weaker party to suffer the consequences of the intervention. Beyond this, cases of unequal trade deals, as in the case of colonialism and exploitation of resources, continue to harm local economies to this day. Economic benefits that may arise from the intervention may not even reach those who need them most, as officials in the countries may choose to redirect the funds to their own accounts or purposes. In the end, such economic intervention worsens poverty, inequality and lack of infrastructures in developed countries, rendering them both unsustainable and unjustifiable.\nIn conclusion, except in cases of humanitarian intervention where it supplements the efforts of local authorities, intervention beyond one's borders cannot be justified on any grounds, irrespective of the intention. Military intervention, economic intervention, and even political intervention all have dire consequences that destroy the very fabric of international relations, exacerbating conflicts, creating dependency, and setting up vulnerable nations for long-term instability. While international institutions must work proactively to create a world where intervention becomes redundant, countries must also respect the sovereignty of other countries, act responsibly and pragmatically, and earn the respect and trust of people in order to skillfully navigate navigating the complex relations of interdependence that we share in the era of globalisation.",
                "c interventionist practices are based on neocolonialist principles and favour western economic interests over those of the host country as the IMF and World Bank, driven by capitalist ideals, provide aid to countries in exchange for restructuring their economies to be more western-friendly. This has led to countries losing their own natural resources to western private entities and disparities between the rich and poor increasing. The infamous case of the African debt crisis- caused by structural adjustment policies of the International Financial institutions - led to Africa losing more in interest payments than they received as loans, exacerbating poverty, unemployment, hunger, and cases of corruption that have become endemic today. In the case of Argentina, which accepted IMF intervention that required the government to reduce subsidies to citizens and lift protective import tariffs, led to an 11-year economic downturn which damaged the relationship between the people and the international community. Ultimately, economic intervention carries negative, long-term consequences, making it unjustifiable.\nIn conclusion, foreign interventions can be justified only when it is asked for by the affected country especially in times of a catastrophic crisis. Any form of unauthorised intervention, whether military, economic, political or otherwise, results in irregularities that further exacerbates the situation, diminishing the sovereignty of the affected country, empowering external actors over internal forces and diminishing the quality of life of the people in the long term. It is crucial that foreign intervention, if allowed, is done with the long-term interests of the countries involved in mind as this will help preserve the mutual objectives of peacebuilding and sustaining international stability.",
                "c intervention is largely exploitative and carries a \"neocolonial\" connotation - the exploited country is forced to open up its markets and often through predetermined structures based on Western ideology, whereby the local farmers and businesses are outcompeted by Western multinationals. This has been the case in Ghana, where Western firms manufacture and sell poor quality finished goods at a premium price, disrupting the local market and making it difficult for local farmers and businesses to compete. Additionally, such intervention obstructs the development of local industries and economies that should ideally be allowed to develop organically. Patronising actions by Western companies often marginalise traditional industries and effectively destroy them - traditional African textile industries were disrupted in the early 1980s by the introduction of cheap Western African textile imports which made it difficult for the industry to evolve organically. Western imports have a heavy carbon footprint, and in industries such as the mining industry whose carbon footprint is huge, there is often little or no restructuring or rehabilitation of the damage caused, leaving a long-term ecological stain. The resulting profits inevitably go back to the already developed Western world, resulting in a net loss for the developing countries that often see little improvement in their economies. This is exemplified by the billions of dollars in gold revenue generated through mining in Papua New Guinea or diamond revenue generated in Sierra Leone - the vast majority goes to fueling the West's consumerist demand, and not to alleviating the poverty experienced in the countries that have been exploited for their natural resources; worsened by the fact that the exploitation of such resources is at the detriment of the environment and the people reliant on it. Thus, economic intervention, due to the exploitative and neocolonialist nature of such actions, cannot be justified as they deepen the problems they aim to alleviate.\nIn conclusion, while the framing of intervention around concepts such as humanitarian responsibility and agency can indeed justify intervention to some degree, the actions undertaken, whether political, military or economic must remain in line with the said obligation to ensure that the adverse effects of such interventions do not outweigh benefits. In rendering intervention justifiable, the interests of citizens, integrity of the state and respect for sovereignty must be maintained. Through an examination of the shortcomings of foreign intervention in different contexts, I reject the notion that foreign intervention can be justified beyond humanitarian responsibility as they are often motivated by neocolonialist goals that exacerbate pre-existing issues and cause long-term costs for the people they aim to help.",
                "c intervention typically reinforces existing power dynamics, further entrenching the cycle of oppression and marginalization for the lower economic classes. Often, intervention projects are concentrated in urban areas and are geared towards export- oriented industries, aggravating the rural-urban inequalities. This practice creates resentment and inadequate funding of rural areas and their economies, leading to the marginalization of rural populations and the continued cycle of poverty. Secondly, economic intervention can lead to a reliance on foreign aid that disincentivizes the domestic economy and discourages self-reliance and entrepreneurship. Thirdly, economic intervention has been used as a tool for occupation, colonialism, and imperialism, with Western nations using economic aid as a means to shape local economies, drawing resources and labour to bolster their own economies. Furthermore, they promote import-substitution industrialization at the cost of local agricultural sectors leading to dearth and malnutrition in local populations. The result is a further entrenchment of the cycle of poverty. The African Union report on foreign aid states that 90% to 95% of foreign aid does not get to the poorest quintiles in society, proving largely ineffective in aiding development and eradicating poverty, and cites that if this aid was directed towards Medicare, maternal and child care, nutrition programmes and basic education, poverty would be greatly reduced. Thus, economic intervention remains unjustifiable as it debilitates rather than assists in the economic development of developing and low-income countries.\nIn conclusion, the justification of intervention is a complex, nuanced issue of competing, often conflicting, values of humanitarian responsibility, national sovereignty, and the rights of the global community. While humanitarian intervention can be justified, other forms of intervention - political, military, economic - ought to be deplored. While the intentions may be well-meaning, the outcomes are often catastrophic. For intervention to be justified, it must uphold the rights and interests of the people in the country in question and must involve the cooperation of that government. Only then can the act of intervention be seen as legitimate in the eyes of both the international community and the local population. In sum, the answer is not the outright rejection but the judicious use of intervention, prioritizing the well-being and stability of local populations over the interests of powerful international actors.",
                "c intervention typically comes with the strings attached as countries are required to follow IMF-mandated policies that privatise and deregulate their economies. These conditions, more often than not, exacerbate inequality within these countries and render growth less sustainable. Deregulation policies have cost millions of jobs worldwide, rendered life more difficult for millions in the Global South, and enabled US companies to process millions more worth of exports without paying their due tax. The alternatives - devaluation of currency to lower wages and stimulate exports, typically pushed by the Washington Consensus - typically harm the working class instead. Examples are the impositions of rigid austerity measures and debt in Greece and Argentina in the mid-late 20th century, that damaged their economies beyond mere repair, leaving citizens with even fewer jobs and greater despair. Secondly, the direct intervention by developed countries in developing nations further harms these economies. In the scramble for Africa, imperialist Western countries like Belgium appropriated resources from African countries, leaving little for export and stifling any potential for growth. Similarly, the Dutch East India Company disempowered Indonesian natives, skewed South African land distribution, among others, rendering these countries stagnant economically for centuries. The damage of these actions cannot be undone by minor tinkering with policy, and hence make economic intervention unjustifiable.\nIn conclusion, while humanitarian intervention can be justified, the consequences of other modes of intervention like military and economic intervention make them largely unjustifiable. While the Responsibility to Protect framework exists, intervention is best left only to those already directly involved in the conflict (like the UN) or when called upon to assist by national governments. Foreign intervention beyond the purview of humanitarian assistance sows discord and mistrust between countries, endangers civilians, and in the long-term hinders any potential development. Countries must grow organically and must find their own means of development, free from the prying of foreign powers that only wish to extract resources and build dependencies.",
                "c intervention often comes with strings attached, such as requirements for free-market reforms and trade liberalisation that may not necessarily be in the best interest of the recipient country. Second and perhaps more significantly, these interventions create a cycle of dependency, as developing countries become reliant on foreign aid and loans, effectively erasing any progress these countries have made in becoming self-sufficient. This was seen in the case of Haiti, where foreign aid after the 2010 earthquake largely failed to rebuild the country beyond the initial disaster relief, and instead caused further economic damage through artificial inflations of prices and dependency on foreign aid that hampered the country's ability to grow sustainably. Economic interventions may also lead to the exploitation of resources and labour, such as in the case of colonialism that plundered the resources of African colonies, resulting in long-lasting poverty and inequality. Overall, these interventions are largely unjustified as they hinder long-term growth and preserve inequality and poverty among recipient countries, illustrating that intervention is an unviable solution best remedied through sustainable development.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention while providing swift aid in times of crisis, fails to address deeper causes of conflicts, and is rather prone to making them worse. It also exacerbates issues such as dependency and exploitation, and it ruins lives rather than improving them. Sustainable development through international cooperation is a more viable and justifiable solution.",
                "c intervention usually takes the form of neoliberalism and is unabashedly pro-Western. The Washington Consensus in the 1980s, for instance, was essentially a neo-liberal blueprint recommending structural adjustment and privatisation measures that made developing countries debt-ridden, poverty-stricken and more dependent on global markets. This denied locals autonomy and made their economies subservient to the demands of international markets, leading to obscene levels of inequality and instability. In practice, economic intervention through structural adjustment programs witnessed GDP growth falling to just about 1% and inflation rising steeply to about 48% in Sub-Saharan Africa following implementation of SAPs compared to 2.3% and 14% respectively before external influence. Furthermore, economic intervention comes saddled with political or ideological conditions, sometimes with strings attached that effectively deny recipients agency and act as incentives for politicians to indulge in corruption or exploit their people. For instance, the IMF and World Bank often demand trade liberalisation as well as open markets, both of which may prove detrimental in the long term to local economies. The liberalisation of rice in Haiti in the 80s, for instance, killed off much-needed local rice farmers as cheap US rice flooded markets. Additionally, many economist reviewers claim that structural adjustment militates against long-term prosperity. On the whole, economic intervention is unjustifiable since more often than not, it leads to economic servitude and in some cases denies locals any agency.\nIn conclusion, while humanitarian intervention is justifiable in certain cases to better protect locals under governments that are unable to do so, the justifiability of intervention in most other cases is a matter of much debate. Military intervention, for instance, is indefensible for almost always aggravating conflict and denying locals the rights it evidently aims to champion. Economic intervention through neoliberalism too, can have alarming consequences and lead to servitude and deny locals any agency in their economies. Ultimately, sovereignty must be esteemed and nations must be especially careful when considering whether to intervene in other countries' domestic politics.",
                "c intervention puts countries in a position of economic subservience, perpetually reliant on the entities that lent them money. This debt trap results in economic stagnation and poverty, creating consequences long-term that ultimately undermine international stability. Similarly, foreign companies using developing countries as outsourcing hubs perpetuate exploitative labour practices, such as using sweatshops and exorbitant work hours, leading to a disregard for human rights. The implementation of the Structural Adjustment Program in Ghana, implemented by the IMF, led to the privatisation of hospitals and the removal of subsidies for basic goods, leading to a humanitarian disaster of vast proportions that affected the most vulnerable strata of society, women and children. The consequences of economic intervention also include the hollowing out of local industries, making them susceptible to foreign markets and not self-sufficient enough to compete with other larger economies. For instance, China's intervention in the African continent by supplying cheap goods, of which 90% are illegal substandard goods, killed the local textiles industry, and led to the loss of local jobs and growth potential that is crucial for the development of the economies in the continent. With the consequences far exceeding the benefits, it becomes clear that economic intervention is unjustifiable.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention can be justified but only when it is humanitarian in nature and asked for by the country under duress. Any other form of intervention, whether military, political or economic is unjustifiable as it worsens the lives of the very people it aspires to help exacerbating conflicts, destabilising regions and perpetuating the suffering of those it is meant to alleviate. It is a relic of colonialism and it is time that the international community reconsidered its use to rebuild countries rather than destabilising them.",
                "c intervention often results in a chronic dependency cycle on foreign aid, perpetuating an unsustainable development culture in the developing country. This leads to a lack of innovation and stifles the natural growth of industries. Furthermore, the provision of financial aid comes with strict conditions that compel the recipient country to initiate structural reforms that are based on western capitalist ideals and do not necessarily cater to the needs of the people. For instance, International Monetary Fund requirements for Argentina to implement austerity policies plunged the country further into poverty as they were forced to cut back on healthcare and education subsidies in a country where the maternal mortality rate is 6 times higher than the United States. This economic imperialism by western capitalist institutions is exploitative and serves no purpose in improving the economies of developing countries. In conclusion, it is evident that foreign intervention is largely unjustifiable as it remains a tool of imperialistic power obsession. Humanitarian intervention should be the sole domain of foreign intervention as it prioritises the protection of basic human rights of people in crises without trampling on sovereignty. Military intervention only serves to prolong violent conflict and yield unintended consequences, whilst economic intervention perpetuates dependency cycles and stifles growth in an exploitative manner. The costs of foreign intervention outweigh any perceived benefits and hence are more often than not unjustifiable."

            "prompt": "Should a good government always protect the interests of the majority?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "succumb to populist pressure at the cost of effectiveness. Plato argues in 'The Republic' that it should be the captain who steers the ship, not the passengers, suggesting that it is unwise to let an educated majority decide on matters they have little experience in. This is especially true in countries like Thailand and DR Congo where the phenomenon of \"vote buying\" - a process in which votes for political candidates are secured by giving monetary incentives to those who are uneducated and in penury - is prevalent. This not only maligns the core principle of good democratic governance that rests on an educated and informed electorate, but also mars the value of the equality of representation by making political decisions a prerogative of the rich. Second, relying on the majority rule could lead to ineffective populist policies that hurt the growth of a nation. This can be demonstrated by a comparative analysis of two countries during the later decades of the previous century - India that depended on populist social welfare policies under the rule of the Gandhis and the Congress Party, and Mao's unpopular decisions (such as the heavy emphasis on capital good production, the one child policy, etc) in China. As a result, India continues to remain in the backwaters of economic success whereas China has succeeded in raising the mean standard of living for its citizens tremendously as reflected in the growth of its Human Development Index. Third, the majority tends to vote keeping personal interests, as opposed to the interests of the nation, in mind. This is evidenced by Donald Trump's win in the primaries and caucuses in Nevada and New Hampshire, among others, despite the fact that his xenophobic closed doors approach towards immigrants contradicts over fifty years of American immigration and foreign policy, once again out of self interest. Hence, the decisions of the majority should be viewed with suspicion and over-ridden by a \"good government\", if necessary.\nNext, the unequivocal support of the majority rule could disrupt the delicate fabric of international relations, resulting in complications and detriments for citizens nationwide. Take the case of the Russian annexation of Crimea, sovereign Ukrainian territory, simply because (as Russia puts it) 96% of Crimeans voted in favour of Russian unification in a national referendum. This unilateral action failed to consider that perhaps the argument of protecting majority interests cannot be used to justify the violation of agreements on the international level and infringe on border protocol. This annexation, clearly 'out-of-order', inspired the West to impose crippling sanctions on Russia, even on basic necessities like food, ultimately debilitating the Russian economy and causing great hostility between international superpowers, seen in Obama and Putin's bickering in the General Assembly. This led to unwarranted consequences not only for the citizens of Russia, but also those of other countries; gridlocks in the Security Council ostensibly led to the aggravation of the Syrian Civil war, owing to inaction by the international community. Blindly following the majority has the potential to antagonise members of the international community and hurt uninvolved parties. Any good government would thus not stand for such acts, in accordance with the \"Responsibility to Protect\" (R2P).\nLastly, the pursuit of majority-favouring policies may be detrimental to the society in the long run as they do not solve the problems faced by the majority at their roots. Policies of affirmative action, such as the New Economic Policy in Malaysia, under the Bumiputera ('sons of the soil') umbrella, has received much criticism for some say it only exacerbates the dire problem of economic growth. This is because it secures the interest of an ethnic majority, by paying the cost of future growth borne by all. Similarly, analysts in the United States have concluded that the affirmative action policies of the past decades in the field of education, such as lowering the barriers for women to get into colleges, have failed because the problem has simply reversed itself in the present day. Today, it is men who suffer from a disappointing 46% admission rate (compared to the 54% for women), suggesting that the problem continues to exist, if not exacerbated, just with a different demographic. Such policies that favour a majority laggard group are not only discriminatory and counterproductive to larger objectives of a nation, but also ineffective as they do little but change the demographic of the victims of unequal opportunity. By no metric can such policies symbolise good governance.\nIn conclusion, while putting the interests of the majority first is acceptable in principle, it paves the way for harmful political decisions that hurt the interests of all. A \"good government\" should not resort to blindly adopting such measures, but rather should implement checks and balances to prevent the tyranny of the majority constitutionally, committing to protecting human rights and act in accordance with international law. Only then can a government that protects the interests of the majority over those of the minority be considered a \"good government\".",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " of importance for the government to acknowledge the concerns of minorities regardless of their small numbers. Protecting the interests of certain minority groups will foster inclusion and acceptance, thereby, reducing tensions between different social groups, thus promoting social harmony. When minority interests are not respected, resentment and tensions between groups can emerge and cause unrest within the country, leading to social upheavals. Moreover, ignoring minority interests can significantly harm those communities - leaving them in an economically disadvantaged position.\n\nA government that continuously prioritizes the interests of the majority breeds significant social inequalities which, in turn, can be harmful to the realization of sustainable development goals. Therefore, a government that protects the interests of the majority while also safeguarding the rights of minorities produces more significant development, social justice, and stability, creating an overall better outcome for the nation as a whole.\n\nFurthermore, prioritizing only the majority\u2019s interests can stifle the creativity and innovation that can emerge from minority groups. Minority groups, such as ethic, gender, and religious minorities, often bring diversity to the economy, diversifying the country\u2019s resources. A good government should always leverage minority talents and resources to create an equitable and inclusive society.\n\nIn conclusion, a good government should not always protect the interests of the majority. Instead, it should strike a balance, ensuring that the rights and interests of both majority and minority groups are upheld and protected. In this way, the government can achieve sustainable development and genuine social harmony. Every citizen should be treated equally in the eyes of the law, regardless of their race, religion, or economic standing. Therefore, a good government can safeguard the needs of the minority by enacting policies that prioritize diversity, inclusion, and equitable distribution of resources while, at the same time, ensuring the development of the majority.",

                "often swayed by emotional appeals. Uninformed voters may not always take the time to research the full implications of their decisions, while self-interest can lead to voters accepting policies that benefit themselves, but harm the country as a whole. Emotional appeals such as those found in damning campaign ads and large scale propaganda can easily sway a large portion of the population, which can create outcomes that are not in the overall interest of the nation. To ensure that a majority decision is truly wise and beneficial, voters must be well informed and have a wide range of perspectives. This requires that individuals seek out datasets, analyses and opinions that are diverse and balanced. \n\nFinally, it is notable that the majority rule comes at the expense of both the majority and the minority in the long run. This is because the majority is often swayed by short-term gains that are not sustainable, and the minority is easily excluded from the conversation altogether. Short-term gains can include a decrease in taxes or the privileging of a specific industry, while the long-term benefits of public goods such as education and healthcare, which do not have such immediate effects, are ignored. The result is that both the majority and the minority become worse off in the long run because they are not focused on the consistent growth and development of the country.\n\nIn conclusion, while the majority rule is supported by an argument based on the principle of democracy, utilitarianism, and international governance practice, the reality is that the majority rule is flawed. This is because it leads to human rights violations, hinges upon a flawed assumption of its qualification, and leads to short-term gains at the expense of sustainable policies and equitable representation for all. Instead, to ensure that governance is truly effective, consideration must be given to the rights of all human beings, and an egalitarian, scientific approach must be adopted. An effective government must not only serve the interest of the majority but must also consider the wider goals of society, and the rights and representation of all groups.",
                "disruptive to social cohesion. Uninformed decisions are those that are arrived at without thorough research or input from experts, leading to policies that are ill-conceived and without a sound basis. A good example of this is the Brexit referendum in the UK, where the majority of voters chose to leave the EU based on false promises and sensationalised reports, leading to negative economic ramifications for the country. Majority decisions that are driven by self-interest, on the other hand, seek to privilege the majority at the expense of the minority, and this is not only unfair but goes against the basic tenets of democracy. Additionally, such decisions tend to be disruptive to social cohesion, creating resentment and undermining the values of community, common purpose and shared values necessary for a truly democratic society. \n\nIn conclusion, the morality and efficacy of the majority rule is not an easily solvable conundrum. While there may be instances where the majority rule is appropriate, it certainly cannot be universally applicable, nor can it be the sole guide to good governance. The guiding principle must always be the protection of human rights, with the aim of creating an equitable, just, and democratic society in which all citizens have the opportunity to thrive and prosper, irrespective of their social status, ethnicity, or political beliefs. Ultimately, good governance must be guided by reason, equity, and justice, and genuine efforts made to ensure that the rights of all citizens are protected.",

Furthermore, relying solely on the majority\u2019s decision may result in hasty and incomplete decision-making processes, leading to poor outcomes. This may cause the country to suffer from poor policymaking and slow progress due to time wasted on reversing faulty decisions made by the majority earlier on. Thus, while the majority's belief should be taken into account in policymaking, it should not take absolute precedence, in order to prevent the consequences of unqualified decision-making, which may be severe in practice.\nTo conclude, while the majority rule may seem like an obvious concept to follow, there are several issues with this approach that require greater attention to ensure good governance. The practice of minority persecution and gross human right abuses can easily be perpetuated through the majority rule, and the unqualified majority can make hasty, uninformed decisions that can lead to poor governance. A more balanced approach is required, where it is understood that the needs of both majority and minority should be considered equally, and governance policies should be made taking into account human rights and international law. Only then can good governance be achieved, where both majority and minority interests can be protected.",

In a world of fake news and echo chambers, the majority may find themselves misinformed, and this misinformation can lead to disastrous decisions. Furthermore, the majority may be driven by their self-interest, leading them to make decisions that are not in the interest of the common good. This was exemplified in the United States during the Gilded Age, where wealthy elites used their power and influence to sway the majority, leading to widespread corruption. Finally, demagogues may exploit the naivety of the majority, persuading them to make decisions that may have catastrophic consequences. Hence, we must be wary of giving the majority unfettered power, as they may be prone to making decisions that have detrimental effects on the welfare of the country.\nIn conclusion, I reject the notion that the interests of the majority should always be paramount over the interests of other groups. The reality is far more nuanced, and a government that genuinely serves the interests of the people, while upholding human rights and international law, is truly a good government. Furthermore, the assumption that the majority is qualified to make decisions for the whole country must be questioned, and policies must be put in place to ensure that the voice of the majority is not exploited by self-serving demagogues.",
                "additionally leave no room for protection of the minority. The uninformed nature of majority decisions arise when voters are manipulated by populist rhetoric and do not have enough information to make informed decisions. As seen in the Brexit referendum, millions of voters were misled by a campaign filled with half-truths and scaremongering tactics. Secondly, the definition of self-interest changes between the majority and the minority groups, and the former may make decisions that are beneficial only for their own demographic but not for the nation as a whole. Finally, John Locke, contends that some laws may seem oppressive to minority groups, but those laws must be upheld by the majority as they are for the betterment of the nation. Such a line of reasoning ignores the fact that minorities also have the right to live free of oppression.\nFurthermore, following the majority rule leads to detriments for both the minority and the majority groups in the long run.  This is precisely because majority views tend to be static in nature, and resistant to new ideas, which may have greater utility or social value in the long term. This is evident in the US, where the Republican majority is resistant to laws that combat climate change despite the irrefutable scientific data. The failure to acknowledge such realities is bound to lead to further crisis for both, the majority and minority groups in the long run.\nIn conclusion, while the majority rule argument sounds plausible, it is flawed in principle, practice and its assumption of a qualified majority. If we truly want to establish good governance that promotes the rights of all human beings while pursuing the greater good, we must work towards adopting a more nuanced, informed approach towards policy-making, one that takes into account societal, international laws and ethics while respecting the rights of both the majority and minority groups alike.",
                "are sometimes even influenced by propaganda whipped up by interested parties, rather than informed decision making. Secondly, the majority may not possess the expertise or experience required to make informed decisions on critical matters of policy and governance. This would result in poor decisions being made, which can have lasting negative impacts on the country and its citizens. Lastly, the majority may be subject to certain biases and prejudices, which can lead them to make decisions that are unfair and discriminate against minority groups. As a result, we need to question whether relying on the majority for complex decisions on issues like healthcare, taxation, and foreign policy is a good idea.\nMoreover, adopting a policy of prioritising the interests of the majority can also ultimately hurt the majority itself. This is because allowing the majority to have unbridled control often leads to a lack of accountability and transparency, which could translate to bad governance. In a situation where the majority rules without question, the ruling elite may be more likely to abuse their power and enact policies which disproportionately favour a select few. This could result in a widespread lack of trust in government institutions, which would be detrimental to the wellbeing of both the majority and the minority. Additionally, allowing minority voices and interests to be heard can lead to innovation and progress, as seen in the case of civil rights movements that have revolutionised societies.\nIn conclusion, the notion that the interests of the majority must be protected above all else is a flawed one. While it is true that in certain situations it is necessary to prioritise majority interests, such as in matters of national security, we need to be careful not to blindly accept this idea. A good government must protect the human rights and international law of all its citizens, only make decisions that are in the best interests of the majority when the majority is qualified to make such decisions, and must not disregard the interests of minorities. Failing to do so can have serious repercussions for the welfare of a country and its citizens in the long run.",
                "often skewed by cultural biases. A good example of this is seen in California's Proposition 8 bill, where a citizen referendum was passed in 2008, invalidating same-sex marriages. This proposition received majority support from uninformed voters who were biased in their views of the LGBTQ+ community by cultural norms and endorsement from the religious right, which were beliefs that are contrary to John Locke's ideas on liberty and equality. The interests of a minority group of Americans were compromised because of a majority vote, which was uninformed and based on prejudicial beliefs. In essence, universal suffrage is a noble goal for society, but the interests of the minority cannot be compromised by an uninformed majority who are driven by cultural biases.\nIn the long run, the pursuit of the interests of the majority to the exclusion of the minority has its own inherent detriments. The minority will grow resentful of the majority, seeing them as oppressive and tyrannical. This resentment can result in civil strife and conflict, even growing into full-blown civil wars. In addition, such a system of governance is prone to institutional injustice, where special interests aligned to the majority are granted preferential treatment, thereby creating an uneven playing field, as seen in numerous examples of gerrymandering in democracies. It is only when the rights of the minority are protected alongside those of the majority that a society can function efficiently and peacefully.\nIn conclusion, the morality and efficacy of the majority rule are objects of polarised debate. While proponents argue that such forms the basis of good democratic governance, detriments in principle and practice highlight the need for a form of governance that protects both the interests of the majority and minority. A society that ensures its government protects the inalienable rights of all human beings, equally cater to the informed choices of the majority, and guards against institutional injustice and discrimination can thrive. Ultimately, the objective of governance should underlie the pursuit of the greatest good for all, regardless of background or circumstance.",
                "sometimes even prejudiced. For instance, in the Brexit referendum in the United Kingdom, studies have shown that many voters who chose to leave the European Union did so without fully understanding the consequences of their decision. The result of the vote led to a political and economic crisis in the country, which could have been avoided if the government had taken a more nuanced and informed approach towards the issue. Furthermore, some decisions that are driven by the majority's self-interest may be harmful to others in the long run. For example, the majority's decision to allow unrestricted use of fossil fuels in the past has led to the current climate change crisis, which will affect both the majority and minority negatively in the future. Finally, majorities may often hold prejudiced attitudes towards minority groups, and their decisions may not reflect the values of a truly democratic society. Hence, the assumption that the majority is always qualified to make decisions for the country needs to be scrutinized closely.\nFinally, following the majority rule may have negative consequences for both the majority and the minority in the long run. As mentioned earlier, majorities may make short-sighted decisions that harm the environment, the economy or the society at large in the long run. In addition, continued marginalization of minority groups can lead to resentment, protests, and even violence, which could destabilize the country. Furthermore, the suppression of minority rights can have a negative impact on the majority's perceptions of themselves as a democratic society, leading to the erosion of public trust in the government and the political process. Therefore, a well-functioning democracy must ensure that individual rights and the rule of law are protected, while also taking into account the interests of the majority. \nIn conclusion, while the majority rule may seem like a straightforward and democratic approach to governance, it is far from ideal. The assumption that the majority is always qualified to make decisions for the country, is flawed, and the disregard for minority rights can have serious consequences. A good government must balance the sometimes-competing interests of the majority and the minority, while ensuring that individual rights and the rule of law are protected. Only through such an approach can we achieve a truly democratic and just society for all.",

Self-interest also plays a role in how the majority makes decisions, as people tend to vote for policies that would benefit them directly, rather than considering the interests of society as a whole. This approach can lead to negative outcomes, such as unsustainable policies or the neglect of certain groups within society. Lastly, propaganda can be used to manipulate the majority's decision-making process, leading to decisions that may not be in the best interest of society as a whole. Hence, the assumption that the majority is qualified to make decisions for the country as a whole is unwarranted, and decisions made purely on the basis of majority interests are not necessarily effective or morally sound.\n\nIn conclusion, I reject the assertion that a good government should always protect the interests of the majority before all else. The morality of such a principle is questionable, and the efficacy of entirely basing governance on the majority rule has been shown to be ineffective in cases where there exist permanent minority groups. Additionally, the assumption that the majority is qualified to make decisions for the country as a whole is flawed, as uninformed voters, self-interest and propaganda can skew their decision-making process. Therefore, while the majority rule remains a crucial aspect of democratic governance, it should not be the sole basis for decision-making in society.

Moreover, policies that ignore the rights of minorities can create resentments and social unrest, which further undermines the legitimacy of the government and its ability to govern effectively.\n\nIn conclusion, while the majority rule may be a universally accepted principle of good governance, it is not always an advisable course of action.

For instance, providing assistance to individuals affected by natural disasters, refugees, or marginalized communities, such as the elderly or disabled, requires special attention. Failing to provide adequate support to minorities could result in social exclusion and stigmatization, leading to long-term negative consequences.\n\nIn summary, a responsible government must strive to balance the interests of both the majority and minority groups. While the majority often contributes more to the economy, it is the responsibility of the government to protect the rights and needs of the minorities who require specific attention.

At the moment, no cure has been found for this disease. One of the major reasons it has infected so many people in these countries is pure ignorance. It is the rural people who are the most vulnerable to this disease since the lack of edu cation causes them to be ignorant of the ways of trans mission of AIDS. As I have mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is already hard for the rural poor to obtain a basic education about the prevention of AIDS.\nThe more developed countries definitely have a higher literacy rate than the developing ones. However, this does not mean complacency can be allowed to set in here. The government of the United States of America, for example, has realised that it is now time to do something about its educational system which is plagued with a drop in standards. Critics have condemned the system in which students are assessed using multiple choice questions which they say do not fully test the students\u2019 abilities and intelligence.\nI see the need for governments to let education be their first concern. In the case of developing countries like India, the government should ensure that education is available and affordable for the young. They should improve the infrastructure in the rural areas so that the poor can easily reached by teachers and so schools can be built. A large pool of illiterate young people is inevitably detrimental to the economy and progress of the nation. It is also a waste of human resources.

            "human_gen_truncate": "uent testing led to massive riotings and demonstrations.\nAs destructive as the splitting of a mere atom may be, it presents an alternative energy source other than petroleum and coal and yields more energy than can be harvested by solar power stations using current technology. Nuclear energy is currently being promoted as it is clean and does not directly pollute the environment and is relatively problem-free. The most important thing is that a whole city can be powered by just a few grammes of raw materials, instead of tons of petroleum or coal.\nHowever, as wonderful as nuclear power may be, there lies the danger of a nuclear meltdown. Experts say chances are very small due to the high level of caution exerted, seen in the precautions taken and the highly advanced technology used in harvesting nuclear energy. Despite all this, such a disaster did take place in the Chernobyl nu clear power station in the former Soviet Union in the 1980s. One of the nuclear reactors suffered a nuclear meltdown and exploded, causing massive destruction in areas of land around the station and sending a massive radioactive dust cloud throughout mainland Europe. more recent report said that a similar disaster was also narrowly avoided on Long Island in America.\nBesides the danger of a nuclear meltdown, another problem of nuclear power is the disposal of the radioactive waste. There is no way to completely dispose of the radioactive waste except to bury them in tightly-sealed containers underground and wait for the radioactivity of these materials to disappear, a process that normally takes thousands of years. Two dangers lie in this procedure. One is the threat of leakage and two, terrorists can easily steal the nuclear waste which are then sold away to countries as raw materials for nuclear weapons. The latter problem is currently surfacing as Russian mafia members are reportedly selling nuclear waste stolen from Ukraine to countries developing a nuclear arsenal. Another problem is the indiscriminate disposal of the nuclear waste. This problem was seen recently in a playground in Britain where radioactive materials were allegedly buried under it.\n20 Though it may seem that for every benefit brought by the splitting of the atom, there are many problems, there is one area where there are only benefits; the medical field. Radiation is used in radiotherapy used to treat cancer. X rays are also fully utilized by the medical field in diagnosis. As can be seen, this is one area where the splitting of the atom solely benefits man.\nAll in all, what is done has been done. The atom has been split by Man and there is no going back to what had been before. What can be done now is to ensure that no new problems will arise and the existing ones kept to a minimum. It is heartening to see Man using the problems to their advantage as in the case of nuclear weapons as deterrents, and much more can be done. Indeed, it is no time for Man to cry over spilt milk, as Pandora did after she opened the box, but to try to eradicate the problem caused by Man himself.",

Not only has this altered the geopolitical balance of power, but also fueled disputes between nations that could lead to a cataclysmic global war. It is undeniable that the spread of nuclear weapons has destabilized the whole international system.\n\nFurthermore, nuclear energy is not without its inherent dangers. Numerous nuclear disasters have been caused by accidents at nuclear plants, most notably Chernobyl and Fukushima. Such accidents have dire consequences for the environment and human health, with radioactivity that can remain harmful for generations. Additionally, the storage of nuclear waste remains a serious issue, and the long-term effects and ultimate disposal of nuclear waste on the environment and humankind remain unresolved.\n\nDue to the above-mentioned risks, many argue that we should not be pursuing nuclear energy as a power source or developing and stockpiling nuclear weapons. Instead, people should focus on the development of alternative, renewable energy sources as a means of generating electricity, which leads to lower emissions and new job opportunities. It is clear that the continued use of nuclear energy and the threat of nuclear arms war poses a significant risk to mankind.\n\nIn conclusion, the splitting of the atom has been both a gift and a curse.

More healthy forms of recreations such as sports can replace computer games.\nMoreover, although computers can improve communications there are also limitations, as computers lack the human touch. Although people can receive information through bulletin boards merely by sitting in front of a personal computer, each user will not be able to under stand the feelings of the other party since there are no face-to-face meetings. In the business world, meeting people is still very important as views and ideas can be transmitted in a more personal manner. The computer is only used when long distances hamper communications.\nEven in entertainment, where computers have created stunning multimedia effects (especially in animated movies), the skills of humanity are still needed. The better quality movies are created not by computers but through the hard work of the directors, actors and technical staff. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, robots and computers are only the tools of people. Research and development in design and product improvement come out of the minds of the individual designers. Moreover, creative products (such as jewellery) can never be manufactured through the use of computers since a unique identity is needed for each product.\nIn the field of police work, no one can deny the use fulness of computers in identifying fingerprints.

When scientists sent the Voyager spacecraft to the stars, they included a plaque inscribed with mathematical formulae which could be de ciphered by aliens, if there are any, telling them who we are, how we live, our genetic makeup and our peaceful intentions. Mathematics is the great common language that everyone can make use of to communicate.\nHowever, we must take a look at ourselves before rushing out to propagate the binary gospel. Our brains function and work in a very different way from computers. Our brains process information simultaneously and in a parallel fashion, and when we think, we muddle along, groping around the edges of what we think we want, our neuron synapses firing furiously, and suddenly, voila! We hit upon an idea. This is what makes us capable of creative thought. Computers, however, pass information through a series of logic gates, filtering out what is not needed, before drawing on databanks to form a conclusion. We are also unable to communicate using numbers verbally. The whole structure of society would be upended if we did so. We are not able to communicate at the speed of our brain cells or computers, and as many ideas, when reduced to a string of numbers, would be extremely long, communication would get even more inefficient.

Even the new \u201cUniquely Singapore tourism campaign features bar top dancing (once banned in clubs) as the norm. While Singapore tries to create a less uptight international image, its efforts have been successful in the national media still only to a certain extent as these seem to be mere the international cosmetic changes since the inter criticizes Singapore as being a democratic socialist state since we have a lack of opposition in the government and pervasive government control in almost all aspects of citizens\u2019 life. Maybe the peace and security we enjoy do come at a price and Singaporeans have not voiced outrage, even with the presence of Feedback Units to gather opinion on issues.\nMoreover, in the social area of the education system, while Singapore shines in international competitions in Mathematics and the Sciences, the education system has been criticized as rigid, with much emphasis on rote-learning, stifling creativity and creating stress which has led to several teen suicide cases. Indeed, the Singapore government has implemented overwhelming changes recently to address the issue, such as giving more autonomy to local universities for student admissions such as taking into account leadership qualities and coming development, creating a school in the arts such as the Julliard School in New York and starting a sports school. Thus, Singapore has been successful to a small extent in tackling this problem which had caused the brain drain of many talented students who could not cope with the education system and went overseas. Hence, while the measures implemented now. recognize the diverse abilities of students, they may have been too late, since much criticism about the education system has been made in the daily newspapers and parliamentary debates, but taking action only now, while worthy of credit, has been at the expense of many students before who struggled and eventually gave up on the system.\nFurther, another social issue is finding the threads that bind Singapore or enhancing the Singaporean identity. PM Goh Chok Tong made his famous \u201cstayers or quitters\u201d speech a few years back, which highlighted the vast number of Singaporeans relinquishing their citizenship and choosing to live abroad permanently. The government has been successful to a small extent in curbing this ill trend by using didactic methods such as national education in schools, ministers encouraging Singaporeans to be nationalistic and holding a massive National Day Parade annually. Singapore was built on the shoulders of immigrants and we are still a young country, hence, nurturing the Singapore identity needs time and less pressure from the government. Nationalism comes naturally, but perhaps more in a crisis, such as the Americans united as one in the aftermath of September 11 and Singaporeans during the SARS crisis and the latest being the crisis of Covid-19. Thus, subtle messages by the government may be useful.\nOverall, Singapore has been fairly successful in tackling significant issues facing her today. Much credit is due for Singapore is such a young country and yet has come so far. Still, Singapore has risen to challenges due to her government willing to bite the bullet and overcome each problem with the well being of citizens in mind.",

To ensure that every student, despite their financial standing, has equal access to education, the government provides subsidies and financial assistance schemes to students from low-income families.\n\nHousing is another challenge that Singapore has faced. With limited land, Singapore has successfully implemented innovative solutions such as high-rise flats and complex \"Build-to-Order\" public housing. The government has been able to provide affordable housing for the citizens' population despite Singapore's scarcity of space, addressing the issue of overcrowding in the country.\n\nLastly, Singapore has accomplished a lot in terms of the economy. The country's economy has moved from a manufacturing-based to a services-based model, with the focus on developing technology, healthcare, innovation, and entrepreneurship. Singapore has successfully attracted foreign investment and foreign talent by implementing innovative policies such as the Economic Development Board (EDB) to encourage businesses to set up shop in the country. These efforts have resulted in Singapore having one of the highest GDP per capita amongst the small-sized countries in the world.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has successfully tackled various challenges that have threatened her progress. With initiatives such as universal healthcare, exceptional education system, innovative housing solutions, and thriving economy, Singapore has managed to maintain its stability despite its small size. Nonetheless, the country faces future battles, such as an aging population, limited resources, and climate change.

Further, there is the advent of new political parties, such as the Reform Party which aims to continue opposition parties some of whom have been silenced from contesting elections due to the ruling PAP\u2019s dominance. That said, censorship laws still exist, and Singapore has been slammed by reporters without border as a country where freedom of press exists only in name. Indeed, in contrast to PAP\u2019s strident stance towards critical journalism, the new opposition parties have vowed to push for basic democratic rights such as freedom of assembly, speech and press. Hence, in the future, Singapore has to strike a balance between respecting the rights of her citizen, and at the same time, maintaining a level of stability, race and religious harmony and economic growth which is pivotal for her survival.\nAll in all, Singapore\u2019s leaders have been able to overcome many challenges, and the future remains bright, so long as Singaporeans continue to stay united and work hard to stay ahead.",

Recently, the government has also started to focus on attracting foreign talent and retaining Singaporeans whilst other developed countries are closing their doors. Policies such as the Singapore PR scheme, a two-year bond where foreigners can work in Singapore, and the introduction of Singapore citizenship for a certain numbers of years have yielded excellent results in retaining foreigners who can contribute to Singapore. However, the government should not adopt a \u201cSingaporean versus foreigners\u201d mentality and should instead address the root cause of why Singaporeans are leaving and how to keep them. This is because Singapore is in competition with other developed countries that are more established and offer better career prospects and work-life balance for their citizens.\nIn conclusion, whilst Singapore has progressed steadily, there is still more to be done to face the challenges coming in future. Singapore should not rely solely on pro-natalism and instead, provide better work-life balance for couples. Singapore should also be forward-thinking and venture into new industries and not merely rely on its traditional industries. Politically, Singapore should continue to improve its image by allowing more freedom of expression and addressing the root cause of why Singaporeans are leaving.",
                "gum) and Singapore has been more receptive to alternative views and media, such as the growth of social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. It is vital for Singapore to evolve and adapt, and be in touch with the changing times, especially with younger Singaporeans who are more globalised and liberal in their thinking. However, this cannot come at the expense of the stability of Singapore\u2019s political landscape. One such example is the legalisation of Section 377A, which criminalises sexual activities between men. While the government has been firm in upholding traditional Asian values, to maintain harmony in multiracial Singapore, we must also be aware of the shifting times and be adaptable to change. Hence, striking a balance between these conflicting views will be pivotal in Singapore\u2019s future progress and development.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has accomplished so much in the last four decades, from tackling water shortages to becoming a global financial hub. However, as Singapore enters the new era, we face new challenges which require innovative and pragmatic thinking. Without a doubt, Singaporeans must play their part in joining hands with the government and not be complacent, if we want to continue our exceptional journey to success.",

One can now express political dissent in the laws of assembly and demonstrations, and even observe gay rights, which was unthought-of decades ago. Indeed, Singapore has made tremendous progress in upholding civil liberties, and has often been cited as a model for developing democracies. However, much work still has to be done to improve our freedom of speech. Indeed, despite the numerous successes, Singapore is still not known for its public debate, and there is a negative perception of a lack of intellectual freedom, and a fear of speaking up on contentious issues. This hampers progress, as an open, critical discourse is necessary for growth.\nFinally, social problems are perhaps the most difficult to solve. Drug abuse, for one, is a major concern. In 2004, $103m was allocated to combat drug addiction, and over 75% of all drug addicts were treated. The government\u2019s tough stance on drug-related offences - the death penalty was recently pronounced on a drug trafficker who caused the deaths of two police officers - has contributed to the eradication of Singapore as a drug transit point. However, drug addiction is still a problem, and more has to be done to educate the public, especially the young, on the perils of drugs.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has come a long way from the devastation she faced at the end of World War II. However, there are still numerous political, economic and social problems which Singapore has to solve. Though the government has taken action, continue to do so, and has often been successful, divisive issues such as this require public feedback. Only with an open dialogue and mutual agreement can Singapore as a nation proceed to greater heights.",

Singaporeans, who used to shun politics because of their fear of the Internal Security Act, are now beginning to voice their opinions and participate in online forums and public debates. This signals a maturing democracy and a greater level of awareness of issues and policies that have an impact on their lives. Furthermore, with an increasing number of opposition parties contesting in the General Elections and gaining seats in parliament, Singapore\u2019s political landscape is evolving and becoming more diverse. However, the government has also faced criticisms on issues such as the media\u2019s perceived bias towards the ruling party and lack of transparency in certain policies. While the government has sought to address these concerns, there is still a need for greater accountability and openness to promote a more sustainable and honest political environment.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has come a long way since its early days as a fishing village, there are still challenges it needs to address in order to maintain its position as a global economic powerhouse and provide a conducive environment for its citizens to live and work in. The government must continue to be proactive in identifying and tackling these issues, while also seeking the views and feedback of its people to ensure that their needs and concerns are adequately addressed. As Singapore enters its next phase of development, it must continue to adapt and evolve to remain relevant and competitive in an ever-changing global landscape.",

This is evident during the General Elections of 2011, where the opposition made significant gains, and in the emergence of socio-political websites, such as The Online Citizen (TOC) and The Straits Times Forum. It is arguable that the government\u2019s strategic movements are motivated by a fear of possible social upheavals as seen in North Africa. Indeed, while it is commendable that the government has responded to calls for greater political openness, it must be wary of becoming too liberal and allowing chaos to flourish when stability is crucial for Singapore\u2019s future.\nIn essence, Singapore\u2019s issues are not unique, as many other countries face the same problems. Singapore\u2019s greatest strength lies in its ability to recognise them, analyse them and then take swift action to tackle them. Perhaps the government can better involve the people by employing focus groups, which allows for more diverse views and greater representation, and more forums like the Our Singapore Conversation held in 2013, to seek the views of Singaporeans. Ultimately, it is the cohesive and hardworking spirit of Singaporeans that will sustain Singapore for generations to come.",

This change is brought about by the fact that there is a growing number of younger voters who demand social liberalisation. However, there are those who fear that such changes would bring about a moral decline in Singapore. Furthermore, Singapore is democracy, although parliamentary, could do with more checks and balances, such as having more opposition members in Parliament. However, the fear of a weak government in Singapore\u2019s early years when there was much social and ethnic turmoil had led to the current government having two-thirds majority in parliament. This lack of opposition effectively curbs the government from excessive politicking, resulting in Singapore\u2019s stability, which is important for foreign direct investments. Nevertheless, with the growing number of younger voters as mentioned above, the government, and to a larger extent Singaporeans, seem to be more open-minded towards varying views in politics, providing some hope for future reform in politics.",

In fact, in the recent general elections in 2020, opposition parties won a record number of seats, which reflects the government\u2019s willingness to listen to the people and the maturity of the opposition parties. However, Singapore still has a way to go, as there are still some laws that restrict certain forms of free speech, and the ruling party still dominates the political scene. Nevertheless, Singapore\u2019s political landscape is evolving, and one can expect more changes in the near future.\nFinally, the social aspect of Singapore\u2019s progress cannot be overlooked. Singapore has one of the highest income gaps in the world, and the disadvantaged in society are often overlooked. Singapore needs to find ways to ensure that no one is left behind as the country progresses. The government has introduced schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement (WIS) and SkillsFuture. The former aims to help low-wage workers supplement their income, while the latter aims to provide all Singaporeans with the opportunity to learn, upgrade and upskill themselves. However, more can be done, and Singaporeans can also play a part in helping those in need.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has come a long way since independence, but there are still challenges to be overcome. These challenges are not unique to Singapore, but how she tackles them will determine her future success. Singapore has always been known for its ability to adapt to changing circumstances, and with the right mindset and willingness to change, Singapore can remain a shining example of success in the region.",

Moreover, the government has been trying to connect with the younger generation, who have different ideas from their parents and grandparents, through social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram. This shows that the government is making an effort to be more accessible and in tune with the needs and wants of the younger generation. On the flip side, some critics argue that more can be done in terms of political openness and freedom of speech, which is currently limited by Singapore\u2019s Internal Security Act.\nIn conclusion, Singapore may face various political, economic, and social issues that need to be addressed for the country to progress further. However, the government has shown that it is proactive in addressing these issues, and it may be a matter of time before Singapore can overcome them. Moreover, one thing that Singapore has done right is to remain adaptable and recognize which areas are crucial for her survival and progress in an ever-changing global landscape.",

This move towards greater freedom of expression reflects society\u2019s maturity and increases Singapore\u2019s global competitiveness, but it also signifies the government\u2019s increasing toleration of the people's views. Indeed, this is a highly positive move, as it allows for greater transparency and accountability for government actions, enhancing the trust and bond between citizens and politicians. However, the lifting of restrictions has also caused some social malaise, such as derogatory comments on social media platforms, which necessitates some level of regulation. Hence, the government must strike a delicate balance between suppressing extremist views and encouraging healthy dialogue and debate.\nFurthermore, security and safety against terrorism remain valid concerns. Singapore has been relatively successful in combating terrorist threats, such as the arrest and detention of Jemaah Islamiyah operatives and involving businesses and individuals through schemes such as the SGSecure and SGTogether campaigns. Vigilance and preparedness must remain constant, as the threat of terrorism is global and even more deadly in the age of social media. Singapore must remain resolute in preserving its peace, safety and security, as it is essential for maintaining her stature as a preferred airline and business hub of the world.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made significant progress over the years, but there are still challenges that require careful consideration and resolve. Some of these issues may seem daunting, but with the same foresight and unity that has brought Singapore to its present state, they can be overcome. The government and people of Singapore can come together to ensure that Singapore remains a shining beacon of success in the region and the world."

Singapore's success can be attributed to its pro-business environment, which makes it attractive for many foreign investors to set up their businesses in the country. Additionally, the government has been consistently investing in research and development to encourage innovation, which has resulted in the creation of many startup companies. With its robust infrastructure and business-friendly environment, Singapore has been able to attract global companies, which in turn has created many jobs for its people.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has faced many significant challenges and has managed to overcome them through its proactive strategies.

Singapore has one of the highest population densities in the world, resulting in a shortage of housing units. However, the government has invested massive amounts in public housing projects. The Housing and Development Board (HDB) provides affordable housing options for citizens, with about 80% of the population residing in HDB flats. Further investment in housing infrastructure and the refurbishment of older HDB flats has allowed for improvements in living conditions and accessibility for the elderly and disabled.\n\nLastly, Singapore has made remarkable strides in the economy. Singapore's economy is one of the most open and competitive globally. Despite its small population and limited natural resources, the country has managed to become one of the world's wealthiest nations through promoting business and trade. Singapore's pro-business policies, strategic location, and accessibility to international markets have made it a favourable location for multinational corporations (MNCs). As a result, Singapore attracts large inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI) that contribute to the country's economy and increased employment opportunities.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made significant progress in addressing crucial issues that have long plagued the country. From healthcare, education, housing, and economy, Singapore's achievements are a testament to the government's commitment to the well-being of citizens.

Education in Singapore has always been of the highest standards, and Singaporean students rank among the top in the world.\n\nThirdly, housing has been a significant issue in Singapore, with prices skyrocketing due to land scarcity. In response, the government implemented various housing policies to alleviate this issue. The Housing Development Board (HDB) scheme aims to provide affordable housing for every Singaporean family. Additionally, the government promotes development of more private housing estates, providing citizens with more property options. They have also implemented cooling measures to curb housing speculation, such as the Additional Buyers Stamp Duty and the Total Debt Servicing Ratio. While Singapore remains one of the most expensive cities in the world, the government has succeeded in providing its citizens with access to quality, affordable homes.\n\nFinally, Singapore's economy has been a significant pillar of success, receiving praise for its resilience and stability. Singapore has made efforts to build a diversified economy, shifting from labor-intensive to high-value industries, such as finance, technology and aerospace engineering. In line with this vision, the government has implemented various measures to attract investors, such as creating pro-business policies, offering tax incentives and signing free trade agreements. Furthermore, Singapore has a highly skilled workforce, having invested in education to create a workforce that is proficient in cutting-edge technologies.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made significant progress in tackling many significant issues, despite its small size. The government has continued to invest in its people, building a vibrant, robust, and stable economy. While Singapore may still face challenges in the future, the country has shown a dedication to solving these issues.

This forward-thinking approach in education has positioned Singapore as a hub for talent in various sectors, including technology and finance.\n\nAnother pressing issue that the government has been addressing is housing. Singapore has an increasing demand for housing due to its growing population, resulting in housing prices that are out of reach for most Singaporeans. To overcome this challenge, the government has implemented various housing policies, such as subsidies and grants, to assist lower-income families in acquiring and upgrading their homes. HDB flats, specifically designed for low and middle-income families, are an affordable housing option that has accommodated more than 80% of Singaporeans. This makes owning a home a reality for most Singaporeans, even though they face challenges in the housing market.\n\nLastly, Singapore's thriving economy is an area where the government has been actively working on. The government understands that it needs to maintain its competitive edge in the global economy, especially in the face of increasing disruption from emerging markets. To achieve this, the government has implemented various measures, such as tax incentives for businesses to encourage entrepreneurship and investments in R&D to stay ahead in innovation and technology. Additionally, Singapore's location and infrastructure have made it a hub for international trade and finance. The government aims to continue this growth, and the economy is expected to remain robust in the years to come.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has faced various challenges, but the government's proactive approach in tackling them has made significant progress in various areas. It is a country that values its people and has made investments in areas such as healthcare, education, housing, and the economy. As Singapore continues to develop, it is likely that it will overcome even more significant challenges in the future."

Raffles knew that this could develop into a major problem if left unchecked and thus told the Town Committee that \u201cthe proper allotment of the native divisions of the town\u201d was necessary. He set about building parallel roads which were lined with properly numbered houses. Different dialect groups were al located to different \u201ckampongs\u201d. For example, the Hokkiens, merchants and carpenters went to live at Amoy and Telok Ayer Streets while the Cantonese, tailors and goldsmiths, lived at Temple, Pagoda and Mosque Streets. This meticulous planning of Raffles helped our leaders to recognise the importance of planning and organising for the population and hence explains the orderly housing estates in Singapore now.\nThe final appealing factor of this period is the fact that this was the time when most of our ancestors from China, Thailand and India migrated to Singapore in search of better-paid jobs. They, being the pioneers of Singapore, worked and slogged all day for a better living. With out them, we would not be what we are today. Our ancestors encountered all sorts of hardships and built our nation from scratch. Every inch of our land is the fruit of their labour and much sweat and blood of theirs have been sacrificed for us. All these serve as a motivation for us that anything is possible and every goal is attainable as long as we are willing to work hard for it. Their hard work has given us a good head-start in growing to be a thriving nation.\nAll the above reasons explain why this period of history appeals to me.

As a result, Singapore was able to attract foreign investors and entrepreneurs, who saw the potential for business, trade and investment opportunities in this young city-state.\nMoreover, the period from 1819 to 1824 also saw the formation of a multi-cultural society, with different races and religions coexisting and living harmoniously.

The impact of this has been to try to address the question of values in schools and in the media.\nDespite concerns about selfishness, the impact of the media has been such, that periodically Singaporeans reach out to the world in an altruistic way-e.g. sending aid to earthquake victims. On an institutional level the Singapore police have taken on peacekeeping duties in Namibia while the Singapore International Foundation sends concerned professionals on voluntary service stints to places like Nepal. Such efforts are laudable and enable Singapore to feel a certain pride in its role in the world, which goes beyond pride in economic achievement.\nLike any other country plugged into the world, Singapore has increasingly sought to make its voice heard in the international community. Professor Tommy Koh, for example, was Chairman of the Rio UN Conference on the Environment. P.M. Goh, recently, did battle in the USA over Singapore\u2019s political system. Being part of the global village increasingly means not only a greater role but a need to assert one\u2019s position when one comes under scrutiny.\nSingapore is a cosmopolitan society and increasing numbers of different racial groups are coming here to live and work and have fun. Tourist arrivals continue to go up and Singaporeans have benefited again in terms of jobs, but also in terms of using facilities developed to maintain tourist interest in Singapore e.g. the Night Safari. Increasingly too, foreign workers or rather, foreign talent are to be found living here. These are not just the expatriates but those who have been moved here, because they have desirable skills, with offers of P.R. status e.g. Indian computer analysts and Hong Kong media people. Thus the talent pool is expanded.\nWith increased affluence Singaporeans seek modern forms of entertainment. With improved air transport and communications, more international arts events are being seen here. At the same time this would appear to have galvanised local arts groups to be more professional, more ambitious and more competitive. As such the Arts scene is considerably more vibrant than it was when Singaporeans themselves saw their country as a \u201ccultural desert\u201d.\nFinally, as part of the global village, Singapore is not immune from some of its uglier aspects.

As the country moves towards a more globalized world, it has become increasingly westernized, erasing its traditional roots. This has led to a lack of interest among young Singaporeans in their culture, history and traditions. There has also been an increase in the consumption of western culture, leading to a homogenization of world culture. As Singaporeans become increasingly influenced by international cultures, they may forget their own histories.\n\nFurthermore, the global nature of Singapore's economy has facilitated environmental degradation. Singapore\u2019s environment has been impacted by the increase in global demand. The country has become a centre for international business, which has led to speedier industrialization. The result is an increase in pollution, loss of greenery, and destruction of natural habitats. With global warming becoming an increasingly pressing issue, Singapore must seek environmentally sustainable practices. While the government has made efforts to increase awareness of environmental issues and promote sustainable practices, these are not enough to overcome the negative effects of globalization on the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, globalization has had both positive and negative impacts on Singapore. The country's economy has grown, creating new business and employment opportunities. However, Singapore's global reach has also led to vulnerability, putting the country's businesses and people in danger.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ks do present problems for the future and should they have a future, such difficulties will have to be addressed before they can remain a viable source of information.\nComputers and the new wave of Information Technology equipment have long threatened to spell the end of books as we know them. Innovation has enabled man to compress several huge books or records enough to fill a small room onto a disc the size of one\u2019s palm. One is now able to access great amounts of information without ever needing to leave one\u2019s chair, with the Internet and world webs are becoming even more popular, easy to use and well-stocked. Even the traditional text book has given way to learning through the computer with each student learning at his or her own speed behind a personalised learning terminal. The speed, convenience and space saving capabilities of computers should spell the death throes of the humble book but the computer too has its share of failings that allow the book to survive.\nHardware is expensive, as many computer enthusiasts would say, and thus replacing all books with computers and disks would be highly expensive and not feasible until Technology lowers the price further. Many poor people in Third World countries can hardly afford books, let alone computers, thus efforts should be placed to give books to such places and not seek to over modernise our already advanced world. Books remain, at the moment, the cheapest method of teaching in more backward areas of the globe and this would remain important for a long time to come. Besides, the cost of the actual machines money too has to be spent on training people to use such hardware. All this reinforces the books\u2019 ease of use and simplicity that makes early teaching so much easier.\nThus, books do have a foreseeable future and would not be made redundant, at least not the way things are now. Though Information Technology presents us with much potential, it will be a long time before it is fully tapped and even then will not completely make the book redundant. Many say that perhaps old books have more of a future, that the old antique volumes stand a greater chance of survival as museum exhibits. That is true but I believe that books are here to stay not as relics under glass but both as a source of leisure and as efficient workhorses of the education system, the key to human intellectual development.",

According to a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 65% of Americans have read a printed book in the past 12 months, while only 28% have read an e-book. Many people still enjoy the tactile experience of holding a book and the aesthetic appeal of a well-designed cover.\n\nFurthermore, multiple benefits of printed books cannot be found in digital books. For instance, books can be more aesthetically pleasing, especially rare editions with customized illustrations and leather-bound covers. Each book can have its own unique design that complements its content. Physical books are also easier to lend, borrow or share with friends, fostering a sense of community amongst readers. With this, books are still the best way to preserve memories of real-life events like book signings, holidays, or dedications inscribed in them.\n\nTo summarize, books still possess a bright future despite the increasing popularity of digital media. Printed books will always be a source of knowledge and enjoyment, as well as being an outlet for self-reflection. Digital books are a faster and more convenient way of obtaining books, and they are useful for on-the-go reading. Nevertheless, traditional books remain more popular, especially in the academic and literary community. As long as there is a demand for books, they will continue to exist. The literary form may have evolved, but the spirit of reading shall not die out. Therefore, it is safe to say that the future of books still looks promising.",

Electronic books or e-books, for example, are gaining in popularity and are a way that books can become more easily accessible to people.

Furthermore, e-books can be produced without using tons of paper and can save on printing costs as well, reducing waste as a result. This is why many publishing companies are shifting towards e-books for a more cost-effective means of distribution.\nIn conclusion, even though books may face certain challenges, they still hold value for many people. Their tactile qualities and history make them endearing to the human experience. However, technology offers a way for books to adapt and continue to be relevant. E-books, for example, provide a convenient and cost-effective means of distribution for publishers, while also addressing the issue of sustainability.

However, this does not necessarily mean the end of traditional books. In fact, many people still prefer physical books over digital ones. The convenience of digital media cannot replace the pleasure of holding a book, feeling the pages, and owning a physical copy. Furthermore, there are certain books that are better suited for physical format, such as coffee table books, art books, and collector's editions. Therefore, the future of books seems bright as they still hold a significant role in maintaining the reading culture and providing a unique reading experience.\n\nIn conclusion, books have been an essential part of human life, providing knowledge, entertainment, and escape for centuries.

            "human_gen_truncate": "mind, and guided by the author, the setting, the character, the sounds the whole tapestry along which the story runs is woven from the fabric of one\u2019s imagination, which is more vivid and thrilling than any film can ever be. No doubt, Peter Jackson\u2019s remarkable interpretation of Tolkien\u2019s \u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 delighted many, but perhaps one who had read the books was expecting Middle Earth to look more, well, medieval? The way a book opens itself to interpretations also makes reading again more exciting and worthwhile, as a story is rarely read the same way twice.\nThis aspect of interpretation also limits the scope of films, giving yet more reason to continue reading. A film is based on the director\u2019s interpretation of the book, as illustrated by the \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 example. This fact, along with the nature of films to be mere adaptations of books, means one can never take away the complete experience of reading from watching a film. What is more, the director may produce a distorted or objectionable interpretation, such as in the case of Lee Ang\u2019s \u2018The Hulk\u2019, which many long-time followers of the comic book disapproved of.\nAnother limitation of a film is that very often it cannot portray certain emotional undertones in a book, nor can it accurately convey the mood or ambience the author might have intended. An actor might be excellent at producing a pained look, complete with that half-wince and barely visible shivering of lips, but he still will not able to show \u2018his heart is cracking\u2019 or \u2018pain gripped his lungs\u2019. Mel Gibson\u2019s controversial \u2018The Passion of Christ\u2019 is an example of how a film is unable to reproduce the transient, spiritual nature of the text it is adapted from, as well as how the power of words is open to a myriad of interpretations.\nFurthermore, reading will always be practical. The improving and development of one\u2019s language, and the convenience of pulling out a book and putting it down as and when one desires, have nothing to do with tradition. Reading is a way to pass the time while improving yourself at the same time \u2013 a language workout, some might call it and you can pause whenever you want to.\nTherefore, even though films may appear superior to books, and reading is redundant, one only needs to consider the value of reading to realize that films can never replace the experience of reading. In fact, films often draw attention to the books they were adapted from, such as \u2018Seabiscuit\u2019 and \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019. The purpose of such films should be to complement one\u2019s reading experiences, to make the story more complete in a tangible manner. Reading, in itself, is still very much a necessary and practical action that opens up a wealth of possibilities.",

Readers crawl into the mind of the protagonist or the antagonist, which can help us develop a connection with them. In comparison, movies are limited in the amount of time they can spend on the character\u2019s persona and development. This is why reading will always be a more comprehensive and satisfying experience than watching the same story on the silver screen.\n\nAdditionally, reading books increases one's vocabulary compared to watching movies. Books expose readers to new words, expressions, and writing styles, which can be challenging but rewarding at the same time. By incorporating these new words into one's vocabulary, they can improve their communication skills, written and verbal communication, and enhance their capacity for critical thinking and analysis.\n\nFurthermore, the process of reading can be therapeutic and relaxing, and it allows one to escape the distractions of modern society. Reading a book can be a refreshing break from the digital deluge that we face in today's world. Even just 20 minutes of reading every day can help clear the mind and reduce stress levels. As a result, reading is a more effective stress-reliever than watching a movie.\n\nTo conclude, the availability of books that have been adapted into movies, should not decrease the value of reading. Reading is an essential skill which contributes to personal growth and development, intellectual curiosity and imagination which cannot be compromised. Reading is an active engagement that promotes creativity, deep thinking, and cognitive development, which can never be matched by any form of entertainment.

Reading is like being the director of one\u2019s own imaginary film, and the possibilities are endless. Watching a film can never bring the same depth of immersion and emotional connection as a book can.\nFurthermore, reading can be a much-needed break from the distractions of the modern era \u2013 the glowing, buzzing screens and non-stop social media notifications. In this age where people are perpetually glued to their phones and other electronic devices, reading provides a reprieve that is much needed for our mental and emotional well-being. It is a quiet activity that demands the reader\u2019s full attention, allowing for introspection and contemplation. It can thus be seen as a more fulfilling use of one\u2019s leisure time.\nIn conclusion, while film adaptations of books may be gaining popularity and competing for audiences, reading can never be replaced. Even with the advancements in technology and the visual appeal of films, books hold the advantage of offering a wider, more enriching experience, as well as promoting imaginative thinking and offering an escape from the distractions of the digital age.

As they say, the book is always better than the film adaptation precisely because of this reason.\nMoreover, reading books sharpens one\u2019s critical thinking skills and improves one\u2019s language proficiency. When reading books, one is required to delve into the story, to analyse the plot and characters, and to decipher the author\u2019s intention. Films, on the other hand, are handed to us on a silver platter \u2013 everything is laid out in front of us. This makes it easy for us to become lazy thinkers. Reading also exposes us to a wider range of vocabulary, and teaches us how to express ourselves better with words.\nIn conclusion, while films might make for a more instantaneously gratifying experience, reading books is still an important practice that should be continued. The ability to create something unique to oneself while reading, as well as the intellectual and linguistic benefits associated with it, are valuable experiences that no digital art can replace. Ultimately, it is the combination of both mediums that will provide the most well-rounded source of entertainment, and enhance one\u2019s quality of life.",

This process is essential for cognitive development, as it sharpens one\u2019s analytical skills and mental faculties. Imagination, fostered through reading, is what leads to creative thinking, and creativity is what fuels human innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, while film adaptations of books may be technically improving, they cannot substitute for books. Films can capture visually stunning scenes and make great entertainment, but they lack the depth and breadth that books offer. As humans, we have the innate ability to imagine and create worlds for ourselves, and reading is an excellent means of unlocking and training that ability.

In a film, everything is laid out for the viewer, from the characters\u2019 appearance to the setting \u2013 all the viewer has to do is watch. This leaves no room for personal interpretation, or to fill in the gaps with one\u2019s creative imagination.\nReading also cultivates and enhances the vocabulary of individuals \u2013 words encountered in books are often not used in day-to-day language, and can expand one\u2019s lexicon. Reading also provides richer insights into characters and their thoughts than films, and complements visual art by not just \u2018showing\u2019 the story, but \u2018telling\u2019 it too. Hence, reading provides a more immersive experience, one that cannot be replicated by film-making.\nIn conclusion, while the trend of adaptations from books to film may lead to competition between the two mediums, it is unlikely to cause either to become obsolete. The experience of reading a book, and the experience of watching a film, are unique, and cannot be substituted by the other. While films may provide a more immediate, visual spectacle, they cannot replicate the imaginative experience of reading, and the wealth of stories, insights, and vocabulary that literature can provide. In short, reading is, and will always be, a timeless experience.",
                "mind a wholly unique interpretation of the text. This then becomes a personal experience, one that is entirely different from that of other readers. Watching films, where nuances in each scene is already catered for by the director, the viewer\u2019s imagination takes a back seat. Reading books allows one the ability to develop one\u2019s own cognitive and creative abilities as the process of imagining and creating your own version of the story helps to stretch one\u2019s imagination, which is a vital skill in developing a reader\u2019s cognitive development.\nFurther, reading provides us with an intimate viewing of the world through new perspectives, through the eyes of the characters, though usually biased. As many books are written primarily from characters' points of view, reading allows insights into how these characters feel, and how they process and react to the events around them and their moral compass. Characters in movies, on the other hand, are more often than not portrayed rather superficially, hardly shedding any light on their inner selves. There is little nuance in the portrayal of their character, something that often takes up space in books, which allows for the existence of more complexity and a depth of emotions.\nIn conclusion, while films provide a more instantaneous visual and audio entertainment experience, reading books is a more fundamental and enriching experience. The varying interpretation through our individual imagination will never fail to captivate us, and the abundance of literary titles that are and remain unadapted into films will keep us reading for many more years to come. Therefore, while films may remain a supreme advantage for the film industry, there is nothing quite like the experience that reading provides, ensuring the written word continues to have its place in entertainment.",

This imaginative exercise is one that teaches us critical thinking, as we must decipher the white space around and between the words, forming in our minds the details of the world in the book. This is especially true for fiction, where the author\u2019s intent is to inspire and provoke thought, rather than spoon-feed information to the reader. One can argue that the development of digital technology has, in fact, stunted the development of one\u2019s imagination, as it lessens the need to imagine. In contrast, reading sharpens one\u2019s skills of imagination and comprehension.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that films will remain more appealing to some, books will surely never diminish in significance. Unlike films, books hold within them a personal bond between author and reader, where details of the writing style and the imagery are subjective to the reader; different readers can interpret different meanings from the same text. Furthermore, a book is not fixed forever; it can be an endless process of discovery and imagination that does not have to rely on someone else\u2019s creative interpretation.",
                "mind the world, the characters, and the scenes. This is an entirely different experience compared to having everything laid out in front of you in a film. Besides, the effort of having to comprehend and visualise things for oneself stretches the mind, and is beneficial for cognitive development.\nFurthermore, books offer a greater richness and depth of content compared to films. A written piece can go into much greater detail, explaining motivations, thoughts, and feelings of characters. A film, by its very nature, has a limited running time. Therefore, certain elements of the story may have to be cut in favour of the cinematic experience. Books, on the other hand, can delve deep into the psyche of the characters, as well as provide hidden meanings and symbolism which are simply inaccessible on screen.\nTo conclude, while adaptations of books to film may have their advantages, reading will never be completely replaced by films. The vastness of the book world itself, the benefit to cognitive development, and richness of content available in books, cannot be reproduced in films. Therefore, it will always remain an important endeavour to read books, even in the age of film-making.",

Reading also enables one to be more attentive of the story, as one has to focus solely on the words and dialogues on a page, rather than have the scenes spoon-fed into one\u2019s mind. One can spend an hour on a single page of a novel if one needs to, and there is no pressure to \u2018keep up\u2019. This unique aspect of reading is particularly beneficial to training cognitive functions such as mental imagery abilities and critical thinking skills.\nFurthermore, film adaptations are never perfect reproductions of books. They leave out aspects that are vital in the books, which could change the meaning of the story or the portrayal of a character or event. In the Harry Potter series, for example, the films failed to convey the intense internal turmoil and conflicts that the character Severus Snape was experiencing, which were made apparent in the books. This may not necessarily detract from one\u2019s enjoyment of the films, but it does limit one\u2019s understanding of the story being portrayed.\nTo conclude, while films do have the ability to convey powerful images and provide instant entertainment, they cannot match the power nor the richness of the written word. Books will continue to be an essential part of society, as they are sources of ideas and inspirations that are beyond what technology can replicate. films may be more commercially successful, but books are the irreplaceable cornerstone of human civilization.",

This empowers readers to better understand the story and its characters, as well as to connect with them on a deeper, more emotional level. Reading also encourages critical thinking anda deeper appreciation for language and development of vocabulary skills.\nIn conclusion, while films may appear to be the more expedient and popular choice for entertainment, reading holds unique advantages that cannot be ignored. Books offer readers a wealth of stories and information that will never all make it onto the big screen. Reading sharpens the mind, boosting critical thinking and comprehension skills, and feeds the imagination in ways films cannot.

While films may be more entertaining and accessible in many ways, it is important to remember that reading offers an experience that is unique and unparalleled \u2013 one that is hinged upon the readers\u2019 imagination, and provides an enriching journey that is not only entertaining, but also empowering."

Fiction authors observe people and their society to provide setting in their novels. When people read novels, they sometimes learn about different types of people and hence improve their understanding on how to relate with different people. For example, in \u201cSushi for Beginners\u201d by Marian Keyes, three different personalities are portrayed in the novel. They might not be the easy lot of people to handle or relate with but by reading this book, the readers are brought into their lives and the readers will be more understanding to these types of people. Parents and children relationship might not be an easy one. Sometimes parents do not understand why their children act or react in some way. Through some books such as \u201d Man and Boy\u201d by Tony Parsons and \u201cAbout A Boy\u201d by Nick Hornby, parents can be more enlightened on how to deal with their children.\nSome fiction have historical values in it.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ply there is a lot of leeway for evil as long as the end product is good and beneficial. In the case of lies, this is a possibility. Consider this case in World War II: a German woman lied to her nation\u2019s soldiers to conceal five Jews who had taken residence in her house, because she knew what happened to Jews when they were caught \u2013 even at the risk of her own family. The ends: Five lives were spared endless torture and eventual painful death. It is very hard to say this woman\u2019s lies were not justified \u2013 lives are highly significant ends. In fact, our army trains our soldiers to lie in the event that they become prisoners of war. Not only would we justify the lies of soldiers who endured for the sake of their people; we would glorify their obdurate lying!\nYet, not everyone agrees that \u2018the end justifies the means\u2019 in the event of political propaganda. Governments always claim their motives are good- and sometimes even the end results are good, yet even in the face of such evidence of benefits, there is resentment if people feel they were tricked by lies (or manipulation of the truth) on the part of the government. The bottom line is that people do not like to be deceived and will feel cheated even if you did it for their own good. For these people, the ends which may well include higher standards of living, improved facilities, high employment, do not justify their loss of personal freedom and choice when they were not told the total truth and could not make informed decisions. (Funnily, nowadays, the concept of \u2018delayed truth\u2018 is in.)\nIt may be better to assess motives to see if a lie is justifiable, since lying is a moral issue and motives are very much linked to morals. In the practical world, if a lie doesn\u2019t seem to lead to anything worthwhile, it may not be justifiable. But on the moral level, lying when done out of true compassion and a conscious need to do what is right, is justifiable, no matter what the ends are or whether the lie succeeds in doing what it was intended to do. Very likely lying will lead to pain because it is a dangerous and complicated tool \u2013 but many of us still lie knowing that because it is an abstract concept. Sometimes it seems kinder to lie than tell the truth when we rationalise a real life situation. Even a person who is hurt by your lies may forgive you when it is clear your intentions are good, because pure motives are a universal language, recognised instantly and instinctively in a way that all the rationalizing in the world to justify any deed cannot do.\nLet us ask ourselves why there is this inherent need to justify lying \u2013 isn\u2019t it because on some level we recognize that lying is a potentially harmful thing which we have no right to truly wield because it is in a sense playing with other people\u2019s lives without their permission? The need to justify\u2026 reflects the need to be forgiven, by not only those we implicate by our lies, but also ourselves. We all want to know we have tried our best to do what we think is most right. And it is this desire that will continue making lies justifiable.",

Hence, telling a white lie in such a situation may be an act of kindness.\n\nMoreover, lying may be justified in certain circumstances where it can lead to a greater good. For example, if a journalist is covering a story that exposes a corrupt public official, the journalist may have to lie to protect their sources from retribution. In such cases, lying may be ethically justified if it serves the public interest, and the greater good is achieved in the process.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that these situations are exceptions rather than the rule. Lying should not be a regular practice in our daily lives, and the exceptions illustrated above are limited. If lying becomes habitual, it could result in a mistrustful and anxious society that is incapable of relating honestly and openly. Therefore, the incidence of lying must not be taken lightly.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of whether lying can ever be justified is a complex one. While dishonesty can be harmful, destructive, and erode trust, in certain situations, it can be necessary and morally acceptable. If lying is necessary to prevent harm or avoid hurting someone's feelings, then it may be justified. However, we must be aware of the consequences and limit justified lying to exceptional circumstances. In the end, honesty is the best policy, and we should aspire towards being truthful people who cherish integrity and transparency in all areas of our lives.",

For example, if lying were used to achieve a good result but the lie resulted in an innocent person being harmed then clearly the result did not justify the means!\nThe motive of lying is also important. If one is lying to protect the interests of others, then the lie may arguably be justifiable. For instance, if a group of refugees asked a passer-by for direction and the passer-by, knowing the right direction but also some violent and xenophobic locals looking for these same refugees, may deliberately give the wrong direction for the sake of the refugees. In this case, the motive behind the lie is noble, and therefore it may be justifiable.\nIn conclusion, the question of whether lying can be justified or not is a complicated one, with no clear-cut answers. While there are cases where lying may be morally and socially justifiable, they are few and the act of lying should not be taken lightly. The decision to lie or not to lie should be based on careful consideration of the situation at hand, the potential consequences of lying, and the motive behind the lie.",
                "ply that as long as the goal is reached, the way in which it is achieved is not important. This is a dangerous mindset to have because it can easily lead to dishonest and unethical behavior. When it comes to lying, using this mindset to justify lying would not be appropriate. This is because the means of lying, even if they lead to a desirable end, still involve deception and can damage trust. It is important to build trust and maintain integrity, which can be compromised when lying is involved.\nMotive is another way to assess whether a lie is justifiable or not. In some cases, lying may be done with the intention of protecting someone or avoiding harm. For example, a doctor may lie to a patient about their diagnosis in order to prevent them from experiencing unnecessary anxiety. This type of lie may be harder to justify as it involves a more complicated evaluation of the costs and benefits. Nevertheless, one should still be cautious as it may lead to a false sense of security or misinformation that may cause harm in the long run.\nIn conclusion, the question of whether lying is justifiable or not is a complex one. Nonetheless, we can strive to be honest, truthful, and trustworthy as individuals, as well as encourage others to do so. It is only through honesty and transparency that we can maintain strong relationships, build trust, and ensure that our actions are aligned with our values and principles.",
                "ply that whatever one does to achieve the desired end, no matter how morally dubious or wrong it is, is justifiable. However, it is important to note that whilst some harmful actions may be taken to achieve a desirable end, the ends must be significant enough to outweigh the negative consequences of those actions. For example, a lie may be used to prevent someone from suicide, an action which is significantly more important than the act of lying itself. Conversely, lying for one's personal gain or be nefit, even when the end result does good, is hard to justify morally and ethically.\nMotive is another key consideration for the justification for lying. When the intent is to cause harm, deceive or manipulate, lying is undoubtedly morally wrong. However, if the intention is to protect or preserve the well-being of others, or oneself, then lying may be a justifiable course of action. For instance, a medical professional may lie about the true nature of a patient's condition in order to prevent any unnecessary distress for the patient and the family.\nOverall, it is evident that justifying lying is a complex matter. Whilst there are situations where lying may be deemed a necessary evil, it is important to understand the moral implications of dishonesty. In situations where lying is necessary, it is essential to ensure that the intended outcome is significant enough to justify the lie, and that the motives behind it are pure and well-intended.",
                "ply that any means to achieve a desired end is permissible. However, when applied to lying, it suggests that the benefits of lying should be weighed against the costs and that lying should only be used as a last resort. For example, if a person is in danger and lying is the only way to preserve their safety, this may be justified. However, lying for personal gain is rarely justifiable. This is because the costs of betraying trust, losing respect, and damaging relationships will likely far outweigh any short-term benefits of the lie.\nAnother way to approach the justification of lying is to examine motive. Are you lying to protect someone? Or to avoid getting into trouble? If your motive is to protect others from harm or to avoid causing unnecessary conflict, then lying may be justifiable. However, if your motive is to conceal your wrongdoings or to gain an unfair advantage, then lying is morally wrong.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that lying is a complex issue that cannot be reduced to a simple black-and-white question of wrong or right. While there are situations where lying may be justified, such as when the consequences of telling the truth would be dire, these instances are rare and should be approached with caution. Ultimately, the best course of action is to strive towards honesty and integrity, even in the face of difficult circumstances. Lying should be a last resort and never entered into lightly.",
                "ply that achieving the desired outcome is more important than how one gets there. However, the means of achieving those ends are also significant. If the means involve lying, cheating or stealing, then the achievement of the desired ends may be tarnished by the deceitful methods. On the other hand, if the means involve honesty, integrity and hard work, then the ends will be even more meaningful and fulfilling.\nExamining motive is also an important consideration in the justification of lying. If the motive for lying is to protect someone from harm or to prevent a negative outcome, then the lying may be justifiable. However, if the motive for lying is self-serving or malice, then the lying cannot be justified.\nIn conclusion, lying is a complex issue and cannot be easily categorized as right or wrong. There are many shades of grey in between that must be carefully considered. While there may be some instances where lying may be justifiable, it should always be approached with caution and only considered as a last resort. The weight of dishonesty and the potential harm to relationships must always be taken into serious consideration before making a decision to lie.",
                "ply that any action, no matter how morally questionable, can be justified as long as it leads to a desirable result in the end. However, this is problematic because it suggests that the action itself is not as important as the outcome, which cannot always be true. For example, in the case of a politician lying to the public to win an election and bring about change, that success might help some people, but his or her dishonesty could seriously undermine the public trust which is vital in a healthy democracy.\nExamining motive, on the other hand, seems to be a more reliable way to justify lying. If one can establish that a lie was told with the intention of preventing harm to oneself or others, then that lie appears much more justifiable than one told purely for personal gain or to deceive. Even in the case of social lies, the motivation for those lies are often rooted in kindness, consideration and care, and thus are often justifiable.\nIn conclusion, it is not always easy to decide whether a lie is justifiable or not. There are simply too many grey areas and variables, and at times, situations are not black or white. In such instances, one needs to make their decision based on their own discretion and moral judgement. However, irrespective of the reasoning, the consequences of lying should be considered thoughtfully before making any choice.",
                "ply that any action that leads to a desired outcome is acceptable, regardless of the means used. This view can be problematic because it can lead to severe ethical violations. However, in some cases, the ends may be so compelling that it justifies the means. For example, saving a life, protecting loved ones or stopping a greater evil can all be viable reasons to justify lying. In these cases, the consequences of not lying could be far worse than the lying itself.\nThe motive behind the lie is also crucial in determining its justification. Lying with the intention to harm others or to gain some kind of personal advantage is never justified. However, lying for the sake of protecting someone from harm or avoiding a situation where someone may be hurt can be justified. For instance, if someone asks for the whereabouts of a friend who has been missing for a few days, it may be justified to lie to keep that person safe from potential harm.\nIn conclusion, while lying is generally deemed wrong from a moral perspective, there may be situations where it can be justified. However, great care must be taken to ensure that the lying is not excessive or manipulative. Before lying, it is crucial to consider the consequences of one's actions and examine the motive behind it. In essence, lying should be avoided, but in exceptional cases, it may be the right thing to do.",
                "ply that as long as the outcome is good, anything done to achieve it is justifiable. However, this is not always the case, for the means used can affect the quality of the end result. For example, if a student cheats in his examinations to obtain good grades, he may feel pleased with himself for achieving his desired results but he has missed out on the process of learning and has not actually acquired any new knowledge. In contrast, another student who works hard for his grades may have a better understanding of the subject and may be more likely to retain the knowledge.\nTherefore, it is important to consider the means used to achieve a desired end. In the case of lying, the end result may be desirable, but if it is achieved through means of deceit, the integrity of the person is compromised. In the example of the wife who lies to protect her husband, the ends of protecting her family may be desirable but the means of lying and covering up a crime is not justifiable.\nIn addition to considering the ends, it is also important to examine the motive behind the lie. If the motive is malicious or selfish, then the lie cannot be justified. However, if the motive is to protect others or spare them from harm, then the lie may be justifiable. For example, if a doctor lies to a terminally ill patient about their condition to prevent them from experiencing unnecessary pain and suffering, the motive is to protect the patient from harm and the lie may be justifiable.\nIn conclusion, while lying is generally viewed as morally wrong, there are situations where it may be justifiable. However, each situation needs to be examined carefully, considering both the ends and the motive behind the lie. Ultimately, honesty and integrity should be upheld as important values in all aspects of life.",
                "ply that any action can be justified if it results in a desirable outcome. However, this is a very simplistic view of things. In the case of lying, the end result may be beneficial, but the cost of lying may be too high to justify the means. For example, a politician may lie to get elected, but when he or she is caught in the lie, the public will not trust them. The end result may have been achieved, but at the cost of trust and reputation.\nAnother way to approach justification of lying is to examine motive. If the motive for lying is to protect someone from harm, then that may be considered justifiable. For example, if a doctor lies to a patient about the severity of their illness in order to prevent the patient from becoming overly anxious, and also to protect them from the possibility of suicide, then the lie may be considered justifiable. However, lying to avoid facing the consequences of one's actions, or to manipulate others for personal gain, would not be justifiable.\nIn conclusion, whether lying can be justified depends on the circumstances and the motive behind the lie. While social lying may be acceptable to some extent, the cost of lying in terms of its impact on relationships and trust cannot be ignored. Ultimately, it is important to consider the consequences of lying and to use honesty as a default mode of communication, only resorting to lying as a last resort when all other options have been exhausted.",
                "ply that a bad action can be excused if it leads to a good outcome. However, this principle could be applied in certain cases when telling lies may save lives or prevent harm. For example, if a mother lies about the existence of her child to protect him from a violent and abusive partner, it might be deemed acceptable. Likewise, in situations where children are involved, like telling them that Santa Claus or the Tooth Fairy is real could be seen as harmless.\n\nOn the other hand, examining the motive of telling lies could be another way to assess whether it is justifiable or not. If the motive behind a lie is to hurt someone or to gain personal benefit at the expense of others, then it is wrong. Conversely, telling a lie to protect someone from getting hurt or to help them, even though it might mean breaking the truth, could be considered justifiable.\n\nIn conclusion, honesty is a moral virtue that should always be valued and maintained. However, there may be some exceptions where telling lies can be justified under certain circumstances. Nevertheless, we should be careful with the potential consequences and evaluate the ends, the motive and the context before deciding to lie."

Similarly, every person who has lived a long life can act as a counsellor to the younger generation. Thus, longevity is a blessing in light of this.\nAlso, it is a person with a long life who in his last years, gets to reflect upon his life, whether it be the good old days\u2019 or the \u2018bad old days. I always feel it must be quite enjoyable for an old person to reflect on, to reminisce on the past, evoking fond memories and how they got through the difficult times. A person with a shorter life would not have the opportunity to do that. He would probably die still in his working days, too busy to reflect on life. In addition, a longer life would simply mean more time to be with the family, friends. Thus longevity is a blessing.\nHowever, as I mentioned before, it can be an irony to wish our elders a long life, that is, longevity can be a curse too. Firstly, the older one gets, the more prone one becomes to sickness, ailments, like heart problems, rheumatism, backache and so on. The old are subjected to poor eyesight, difficulty in hearing, weak bones and slower reaction. They are thus the ones who suffer falls, often get involved in traffic accidents and so on. Thus in a way, we are actually cursing our elders by wishing them long life. Longevity can be a curse too.\nTo the country, more old people would mean a financial burden on the society and the tax-payers. In society today, very sad to say, old people are being seen as a bur den and even a nuisance. That is why old-folks homes are thriving in Singapore. Longevity can thus become a curse to the country. To reiterate, we are addressing a very controversial issue in the world today. Are old people a burden? Is longevity a blessing or curse? Well, it all depends on the individual. One who wants life to gain knowledge, to do meaningful things would consider longevity. a blessing. However, one who wastes his or her life doing meaningless things or one who is stuck with some incurable illness would probably find longevity a curse.\nNonetheless, I would not want to live too long a life.",

While advancements in healthcare have led to longer lifespans, they have not necessarily been able to guarantee an equally high quality of life for everyone. \n\nAnother challenge of longevity is the societal expectations that come with it. As we grow older, there is often an assumption that we will retire from work and transition into a more sedentary lifestyle. While this may be desirable for some, not everyone is ready or willing to give up working or pursuing their passions. Unfortunately, ageism can make it difficult for older adults to secure employment or be taken seriously in their chosen fields. This can be frustrating and can threaten one's sense of self-worth and identity.\n\nIt is also worth considering the impact that longevity can have on society as a whole. As our global population continues to age, there will be increased demand for healthcare and social services. Governments and policy-makers will need to find ways to fund and provide these services, which may require difficult trade-offs. Furthermore, an ageing population could put strain on the economy, as older adults may have less disposable income and be less likely to contribute to the workforce. These are complex and multifaceted issues that must be addressed in order to ensure that longevity truly is a blessing for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there are both benefits and challenges associated with living a long life. While there are certainly many reasons to celebrate the concept of longevity, it is important to be aware of the complexities that come with it. As individuals, we can work to stay healthy and engaged with the world around us, while also advocating for policies that support ageing populations.

            "human_gen_truncate": " society in future, where commitment is a strange word for many who do not see it in their own parents.\nMarriage should also be a life-long commitment, not only because of what God wants, of keeping to our promises, of being a role model for the future generation, for the sake of containing the already decaying moral values, but also because if marriage is not a life-long commitment, you may as well term it \u201ccohabitation. Many who cohabited excuse it as a try-out test for their future marriage, if there is to be one. Plainly to be seen, what cohabitation really provides is an access to exit, to bail out quickly when problems arise. They are not responsible enough for life-long commitment, that is marriage.\nSome may argue that marriage should not always mean \u201clife-long commitment.\u201d They cite examples like wife beaters, alcoholics or the career woman who mistreat their partners. I recognise that it is easier said than done, but that is where forgiveness, dedication and love come in. Love does not necessarily mean letting the other partner go on erring; instead, it means helping him to come to his senses. All this entails human endeavour that humans are capable of if they try their best and both partners must help each other.\nTherefore, I conclude that marriage should be a life long commitment because basically marriage calls for responsibility. It is a bond not to be taken lightly. It is not a fashion fad, an escape route, or a try-out. They say diamonds are forever, so are marriages.",

For example, individuals who are subjected to abuse, whether it is physical, emotional, or psychological, may stay in toxic relationships because of the commitment to marriage. In such cases, the lifelong commitment to marriage can pose a danger to the well-being of individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of lifelong commitment to marriage argue that it is necessary for the continuity of family structures. A lifelong commitment to marriage strengthens the bond between two individuals, and it also provides a stable environment for children. Children brought up in stable households are often healthier, happier, and more successful in life. A lifelong commitment to marriage also sets an excellent example for children, who grow up in a household where the value of commitment and dedication is held in high regard.\n\nAnother argument for lifelong commitment to marriage is that it strengthens the moral fabric of society. Marriage promotes a sense of responsibility and accountability, encouraging individuals to work through problems together rather than giving up at the first sign of trouble. Additionally, lifelong commitment to marriage has been shown to promote love, trust, and intimacy. All these values are essential for the establishment and maintenance of a successful long-term relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over whether marriage should be a lifelong commitment has pros and cons. While the call for shorter-term commitments may seem attractive, the benefits of lifelong commitment to marriage, such as promoting the stability of family structures and setting an example for children, cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, lifelong commitment to marriage may lead to unhappy marriages and can be harmful to individuals who are subjected to abuse.

It involves not just the couple, but their families and society as well. A strong commitment to make the marriage last would greatly benefit not only the couple but also the children and society as a whole.

Marriage requires patience, compromise, understanding and forgiveness, which are traits that are developed over time. Therefore by staying committed, they are able to nurture a relationship that is strong, healthy and able to withstand any challenges that comes their way.\nIn conclusion, marriage is a life-long commitment that requires endurance, sacrifice and commitment.

In those cases, it may be better for both parties to separate and seek professional help. However, divorce should not be taken lightly and should only be considered when all other options have been exhausted.\nIn conclusion, marriage should be a life-long commitment to a large extent because it strengthens the family unit and contributes to a stable society.

In contrast, sturdy and lasting marriages contribute to happy families that provide a strong foundation for children to grow and develop.\nLastly, a life-long commitment to marriage signifies the importance of love and loyalty. Love is more than just a feeling, it is a choice to love someone unconditionally, especially during the tough times when it is hardest to stay committed to one another. Loyalty involves being faithful, trustworthy and dedicated to one's spouse. When a couple chooses to marry, they are choosing to make a promise to be loyal and committed to each other, regardless of the challenges that may come their way.\nIn conclusion, marriages should be considered a life-long commitment because it creates stable and happy families, emphasizes the importance of love and loyalty and it is also a promise made that should be kept, no matter how things change.

For example, in the case of domestic violence or infidelity, it may be better for the couple to part ways to ensure the safety and well-being of everyone involved. In these situations, divorce can be seen as a necessary solution to a serious problem.\nIn conclusion, marriage should be a life-long commitment in most cases. The family unit is the foundation of society, and strong marriages lead to strong families and, in turn, a strong society.

Although it is not always easy, a life-long commitment strengthens the bond between partners, creating a strong and stable family unit that is crucial in providing a healthy environment for children to grow up in.

One of the chief counterarguments is that marriage is not just about romantic love and happiness, but also about the commitment to build a life together and raise a family. A lifelong commitment to marriage signifies a deeper level of dedication and responsibility, not just to oneself, but also to the partner and the family.\n\nFurthermore, proponents of lifelong commitment argue that it fosters stability and trust in relationships.

Prominent females, like Margaret Thatcher, have shown that women, too, can have a say in matters of the world.\nIn the past, women and girls were denied education by the men since they found it to be redundant and use less to one who is supposed to stay at home and bring up children, but the situation is different now, when young girls are given the same opportunities for education as young boys. Females are generally thought to be living better lives in today\u2019s modern world but the question still remains: Can the situation be even better or is this the best society can do?\nI feel that there are still many situations of sexual discrimination which continue to exist despite the fact that life for a female is generally better. This is especially more apparently so in our conservative Asian society where traditionally, men are still believed to be the superior sex. Take Singapore, for example; how many female politicians are there? It is a figure which can be counted on one hand! Although certain ideas (such as the one that women should stay at home) are being gradually worn down, it is still difficult for society to accept certain ideas or dreams a woman might have. For example, a woman might want to join the army but in such a traditionally male-dominated job in certain conservative societies, it is difficult for a lone woman to change this narrow perception. Many women, besides politicians, are also not given the due respect they deserve for achieving so much with their lives.

Thus, while we have come a long way, there is still much work to do to create a truly equal society for all.\nIn conclusion, it would be wrong to compare the lives of women then and now as they are vastly different. While women, then, may have found happiness in their restricted lives, it is still essential to continue striving for equality and to acknowledge the progress that has been made.

What is even worse is the act of abortion in multiple pregnancies where certain foetuses are aborted in favour of others. Who are men to know the future only by judging the present? Is it acceptable that the strong foetus is chosen against the weak? The real controversy here lies in the fact that men are playing God or trying to play God and this may backfire on mankind in one way or other. Furthermore, they argue that the liberalisation of abortion laws would even lead to the acceptance of the termination of the sick, old and deformed, that the act of euthanasia may sprout from the action of abortion.\nThis further brings us to the true meaning of life. We have been told and taught that life is a precious gift from God, and it is priceless, invaluable and only given to us once \u2013 of course putting the idea of rebirths aside. Is it not a shame to be able to take life in a few seconds, so sim ply, and easily? For example, in Singapore, abortions can be carried out with the mere payment of $5.00. Is life worth only that little? It is truly a degradation of the hu man species by making life seem so cheap and useless. Moreover, with the creation of drugs such as the RU486, abortion can be carried out without any pain at all and the mother is said to be able to \u2018dance a jig\u2019 two hours later.\nBut then, why raise such an alarmist view on abortion when suicide, murder and death sentences have existed for such a long long time? There is no set answer for it is up to an individual to decide.\nPro-natalists also argue that abortion is used as a means of population control. Maybe the reaction should be \u2018Goodness gracious me!\u2019 Don\u2019t we have enough methods of birth control that save so much trouble by avoiding fertilisation all together? Why conceive at all if one plans to terminate the pregnancy? Must that be the method of birth control she chooses? Indeed, it is horrible to think of it that way but it is true, for certain countries do use abortion for population control reasons. This further pro motes sexual promiscuity as, since abortion can be so easily \u2018obtained\u2019, why restrain yourself at all?! For example in Singapore, before the 1970\u2019s, the number of abortions per year used to be less than 50 people but currently, more than 20,000 abortions a year are carried out, 10% being teenagers. The Abortion Act of 1974 allows abortion with the written consent of the mother, and for girls above 18, parental consent is not needed. Pro-abortionists ask why a child should be brought into the world when he is after all going to suffer because of his parents? But then again, who are we to judge the future? Maybe, we should just let nature take her course.\nHence, it is hard to give one rigid stand on the question of abortion for it would seem to be like passing a judgement in the dark, without evidence. The issue should be studied on a case to case basis.

The government can encourage smokers to kick the habit but it cannot force them to do so. It can be seen as unjust for the government to treat smokers who have contracted lung cancer when this is the result of their own doing. Certainly we can be responsible for own health by adopting a healthier, better lifestyle.\nWe can take into account our mental health, besides physical health. It is up to us to purposely seek relief from stress. We can plan our own leisure and take up hobbies to pass time. Relaxation is important to keep our body and mind hale and hearty. After a long day\u2019s work, it is imperative for us to enjoy ourselves. To deny ourselves rest and persist to work overtime can be detrimental to our bodies. Yet, it has been argued that the working environment that we live in makes it difficult for us to be accountable for our own mental health. In Singapore, stress can be so overwhelming that it is often beyond us to combat it. The competitive and propelling force be hind Singapore\u2019s economic success also drives her people up the wall. Students are taxed and conditioned to perform. Workers have to persistently upgrade themselves, so as not to \u201close the edge of competitiveness\u201d. We are all gladiators in this corporate rat-race, that sanity has become a prized jewel. Thus, it can also be argued that the government can be responsible for our mental health, by complementing a strong economy with citizens that are fit and happy. By advocating less industrial competition, our citizens can have more time for rest and recreation.\nHowever, we have to note that the pursuit of material ism depends ultimately on the individual. It is up to one self to balance one\u2019s life between work and leisure. Thus, again, we can be culpable for own mental health as we can detach ourselves from the stress and strain of society. Yet, not everyone can be responsible for his own health. For those living under the poverty line, government aid is necessary. When deprivation and misery is the norm of one\u2019s life, one will not be inclined to healthy living but survival. Moreover, some health problems like epidemics are beyond one\u2019s control. The COVID-19 virus, Ebola virus and other tropical malaises cannot be attributed to the fault of anyone.\nDespite this, I maintain my stand that we should be responsible for our own health.

Mental health issues are very common today, and often people tend to ignore their mental well-being. Engaging in meditation, mindfulness, and physical activities like yoga can significantly improve our mental state and help us cope with stress and anxiety. Seeking professional help when necessary should also be encouraged.\n\nAnother aspect that we should be responsible for is avoiding harmful habits like smoking and consumption of alcohol. Smoking is a leading cause of preventable diseases like bronchitis, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Similarly, excessive drinking can lead to liver damage, heart disease, and mental health issues.\n\nLastly, staying aware of warning signs can help us identify health issues early and prevent complications. Regular health check-ups and consultations with medical professionals can help us stay up-to-date on our health status and prevent severe health issues. Staying knowledgeable about different health conditions, their causes, and symptoms can help us diagnose and treat them early.\n\nIn conclusion, it is our direct responsibility to ensure we take good care of our health. Adopting a healthy lifestyle, regular physical exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, mental well-being, avoiding harmful habits, and staying aware of warning signs are some of the key factors that contribute to good health.

Governments have to work within their means and budget, and there is always a limit to the amount of resources that can be allocated to health care. In some countries, the waiting time for medical treatment can be long, and some people may opt for private healthcare instead. Governments have to strike a balance between providing adequate health care services and ensuring that their population is not burdened with high taxes and healthcare costs.\nIn conclusion, the responsibility for health care should be shared between the individual and the government. Individuals have to take responsibility for their own health by making wise choices in their diet and lifestyle.

Accidents and unforeseeable medical conditions occur, and it is impossible for us to predict when they might happen. In such cases, it is only right for the government to step in and provide the necessary medical care to those in need. This is where the government's responsibility comes into play.

So, the government must ensure good diplomatic ties with other countries, and have strong military forces to safeguard the country. This is a crucial aim of governance that cannot be taken lightly.\n\nLastly, good governance must ensure social welfare. The government must play a prominent role in providing basic needs such as healthcare, education, housing, and sanitation. This responsibility is necessary to fulfil the needs of people who cannot afford such amenities. The socially weak people require compensatory provision of services and goods that they cannot obtain through free competition in their societies. The government must provide social welfare support as an important way of redistributing the nation\u2019s wealth equitably. Social stability can be achieved with a more socially conscious approach to governing by ensuring that no one is left behind in the quest for a better life.\n\nIn conclusion, good governance is multifaceted and requires a delicate balance between economic well-being, security, and social welfare.

This can be achieved by maintaining strong defence forces which can deter potential threats and by building strong relationships with other countries.\n\nWhile the government has an obligation to ensure the economic well-being and security of its people, it also has a responsibility to protect the environment. This is no easy task as there is a trade-off between economic growth and environmental sustainability. Economic growth often leads to greater usage of natural resources and higher pollution levels which can lead to environmental degradation. The government must ensure that economic growth is sustainable and that natural resources are managed effectively so that they do not become depleted. This can be achieved by implementing policies aimed at promoting sustainable development, such as subsidizing \u2018green\u2019 technologies or imposing taxes on environmentally harmful practices.\n\nIn essence, good governance requires that the government meets the aspirations of its people in terms of economic well-being, security and environmental sustainability. Achieving these goals can be challenging, but with visionary and responsible leadership, it is possible to succeed. Ronald Reagan\u2019s view that the government is the problem may be an oversimplification of the role of government, but it does highlight the need for the government to have a clear understanding of its priorities and to work tirelessly towards fulfilling its obligations to the people.",

Therefore, it is essential for governments to take national defence and foreign policy seriously to maintain stability and security.\nEducation is also another important aim of government. Education can help to reduce the gap between the rich and poor. It provides equal opportunities to learn and creates mobility in society. Education contributes to economic growth and development, makes people independent and enhances the quality of life. It can also create social cohesion, helping people from diverse backgrounds to interact and understand one another. The government must ensure that education is accessible and affordable to all, regardless of their financial background.\nIn conclusion, the role of government extends far beyond the negative view that Reagan had expressed. A government has to keep in mind the well-being of the people, both in terms of economic and social stability, while ensuring that the country is defended from external threats. It also has to invest in education to create an inclusive and sustainable future for its citizens. It is the government's responsibility to achieve these objectives and make the country a better place for all.",

The government should strive to ensure that these basic amenities are affordable and accessible to all. This would help to improve the standard of living and the quality of life of the citizens. Education, in particular, is an important tool for social mobility and equal opportunities. The government must ensure that education is accessible to all, regardless of their social status or financial background.\nIn conclusion, while the government may not be the solution to all our problems, it does play a crucial role in ensuring the well-being and stability of the country. Its role in providing basic amenities, maintaining security and economic growth cannot be underestimated. As such, we should hold our government accountable and ensure that they fulfill their duties to the best of their abilities.",

It is therefore important for the government to ensure that the country is well-protected and secure against external threats. This not only helps to safeguard the nation\u2019s progress but also ensures the safety and well-being of its citizens.\n\nFurthermore, the government also has a responsibility to protect the social and cultural values of its people. In a world where globalization and modernization are becoming more prominent, there is a risk of losing traditional cultural identities. It is the government\u2019s role to promote and protect these values by encouraging cultural exchange programmes and educating the younger generations in the importance of maintaining their cultural heritage. By doing so, the government can help build a strong sense of national identity and pride, which is vital for nation-building.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may hold a negative view of the role of government, it is undeniable that government plays a crucial role in maintaining peace, stability, and prosperity in a nation.

Despite their strengths economically, their security situation is still tenuous due to external threats from countries such as China, Iran and North Korea respectively. Hence ensuring the stability and security of a country is a fundamental responsibility of any government.\nFinally, a government must also uphold the rule of law and protect individual rights. Citizens expect the government to create and enforce laws in a just and fair manner. The government must also ensure that the individual rights of citizens are protected and that they are not violated. This is important in maintaining social order and ensuring that citizens have faith that the government is looking out for their best interests. The protection of individual rights is a key component of democracy and freedom.\nIn conclusion, while Ronald Reagan's statement may be too simplistic, it is true that good governance is a scarce commodity in the world today. Governments are expected to fulfil various aims such as ensuring economic well-being, maintaining security, and upholding the rule of law and protecting individual rights. A government that can effectively address these issues stands a better chance of being successful.",

This can be through the development of a trained army, military alliances with other nations, and ensuring that the country is well-equipped to face any security challenges.\nGood governance is also about ensuring that the government is transparent and accountable to its people. This is especially important in today\u2019s society where people are more aware of their rights and have access to information through social media and other platforms. The government must be able to provide clear and timely updates on its policies, budgets, and actions. It must also be willing to listen to the concerns of its citizens and address them accordingly. Transparency and accountability are essential in building trust between the government and its people. Without trust, people will lose faith in their leaders and governance will suffer as a result.\nIn conclusion, good governance is about fulfilling the fundamental aims of providing economic well-being, ensuring stability and security, and being transparent and accountable. When these aims are met, the government can earn the trust of its people and ensure a stable and prosperous future for all. It is important for leaders to remember that they are servants of the people and must act accordingly. The government is not the problem, but it is up to the leaders to ensure that it is part of the solution.",

Hence, the government must ensure the country is well-defended by maintaining a strong military presence and forging strategic partnerships with other countries. This will also serve to boost the government\u2019s legitimacy in the eyes of the people, as a country that cannot defend itself cannot be seen as a credible or capable government.\nLastly, the government also has a responsibility to ensure social justice and equality for all. This includes ensuring fair access to education and healthcare, providing welfare for the needy and marginalised, and protecting the rights of minority groups. The government cannot turn a blind eye to the plight of such groups, as doing so would only further deepen the social divide. The promotion of social justice and equality is essential to create a cohesive society, where people feel valued and included regardless of their background or social standing.\nIn conclusion, although Ronald Reagan\u2019s quote may portray a negative view of the role of government, it is clear that government still serves an important purpose in society. The government must fulfil its aims of promoting economic well-being, ensuring stability and security, and promoting social justice and equality.

For instance, in Bosnia-Herzogovena, the Serbs are slaughtering Bosnians by the thousands under their scheme of ethnic cleansing. More recently, conflict has erupted in Rwanda between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes after the assassination of their President. As a result, many Tutsis have been massacred by the Hutu security forces. What is more disheartening is that the United Nations are not taking any significant measures to end such genocide. Thus there is a strong possibility that more of such conflicts will arise in the future.\nMeanwhile, in the social sphere, mankind should also be pessimistic about the future. To date rising crime rates are experienced in many Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Moreover, the crimes are becoming more brutal and the criminals younger and younger. Children are no longer the symbol of innocence. For instance, in London, two ten-year-old children were arrested for bludgeoning a toddler, James Bulger to death. Meanwhile, in major cities in the United States people are being gunned down daily. With such ever-increasing crime rates, how can mankind be optimistic about the future if our personal safety is being threatened increasingly?\nIn the economic sphere, mankind also has little rea son to be optimistic about the future. With the fall of the communist nations, one might have expected the world economy to boom due to the emergence of new markets. However, this is not the case. In fact, the fall of communism has worsened the global economic situation by creating massive unemployment and hyperinflation.\nFor instance, with German Reunification in 1989, Western Germany\u2019s unemployment rate almost trebled. This was because most of the citizens of the ex-communist East Germany lacked sufficient training for most of the jobs available. With the reunification the East Germany army was dissolved and this created massive unemployment. In the People\u2019s Republic of China, hyperinflation is rampant as not enough consumer goods. are produced to meet local market demand. Such conditions threaten to persist into the future.\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, we should certainly be pessimistic about the future.

However, this high cost of living is often accompanied by a high standard of living as well, which basically means that residents of these cities enjoy an amazing array of goods and services, nearly everything from the wonderful West and the fabulous East, so to speak.\nHowever, apart from all these \u201cboons\u201d that are associated with major world cities there are the hectic and often suffocating lifestyles of their residents. These cities often have very high literacy rates, which often mean that society in these cities is largely meritocratic. This is especially so in Asian cities such as Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore. Everyone is struggling to climb the corporate ladder and be competitive. As a result, the residents of the cities often suffer from severe stress and in extreme cases, depression. Observers comment that people from these cities often do not realise there is a lighter side to life, that they often have no time to stop and \u201csmell the roses\u201d.

            "human_gen_truncate": " generations. Thus, it is largely up to the fam ily to make culture and religion a part of young people\u2019s lives.\nAnother important part of the family\u2019s role in nurturing youth is in the sort of influence the parents. and siblings present. I recall an incident when my uncle tried to convince my cousin to work harder in her studies. My indignant cousin retorted matter-of-factly that since her brother did not work hard then she had no obligation to do otherwise! Influence can be divided into two broad categories: good and bad. The bad influence can include anything from a lack of proper manners and using vulgar obscenities to committing crimes. Young children\u2019s impressionable minds are easy victims of such negative influences, and teenagers are encouraged by their elders\u2019 actions and use them to justify their own errors. Good influences, however, lend moral strength and help in moulding young people\u2019s characters.\nLastly, the family\u2019s role is important in nurturing young people through the social environment it presents. It is crucial that the environment the family presents is one of security, warmth and love. Such an environment is conducive to the building of good character, for the young person is not bothered by many other problems she would face in a turbulent environment. Insecurity, in the face of financial difficulties, divorces between bickering parents, and other problems the family faces, threaten the cohesion of the family as a unit and give young people more problems. Young children are confused and helpless in the face of so-called \u201cadult problems\u201d and these problems, especially divorce and poverty, leave scars on the child\u2019s memories and may hinder the child\u2019s ability to form strong and fruitful relation ships in the future. Teenagers already face the stress of their academic endeavour and the confusion of emotional problems, and need a more secure environment for a sense of peace. More often than not, the desire to belong in a larger group and to be popular is observed in a teenager. If she does not experience this sense of belonging even in the family, she is more apt to break down in the face of peer pressure. In more serious cases, teenagers join gangs and other small groups, and then indulge in activities not constructive in improving their lots in life. Thus, it is clear that the youths need a place where they can go back to feel warmth and security and to receive motivation and moral support. A few words of praise and a couple of pats on the back can help a person a lot, as it did me. Such is the power of moral support.\nIn conclusion, the family is a fundamental instrument in the nurturing of young people\u2019s lives. It provides, ide ally, guidance, security, warmth and an environment conducive to good character-building. In addition, it prepares the young person for life in the world outside \u2013 society and the challenges it presents and arms her for life to face the trials of modern living.",

Busy work schedules often make it challenging for families to spend quality time together, but it is essential to carve out time from the daily routine to enjoy some moments of togetherness. This could include activities such as cooking, playing sports, or even watching a movie together. Such activities help to build a strong sense of belonging to the family, making the child feel connected and secure.\n\nHowever, it is unfortunate that not all children are fortunate enough to grow up in positive family environments. Abusive or neglectful parents have a detrimental effect on the child's mental and emotional development. Such children may have difficulty building trust, forming relationships, and may even struggle with mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.\n\nIn such cases, it is essential to have a supportive system, which could include teachers, counselors, and other authorities who can intervene and provide the necessary assistance. It is imperative to ensure that every child has access to the necessary support and resources they need to overcome their challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, the family plays a critical role in nurturing youth. Parents must create a positive and nurturing environment that fosters emotional and cognitive development. They must communicate effectively, provide opportunities for extracurricular activities, enjoy moments of togetherness, and understand their children\u2019s unique personalities and passions.

If this security is absent \u2013 either through neglect, abuse or indifference \u2013 then the young person is likely to feel insecure, and it may affect her confidence and ability to take on the world.\nFinally, the family is important in the inculcation of moral values, providing the young person with guidance to make healthy moral choices in life. A lack of moral values may lead one down a destructive path, which can cause chaos in society. The family, therefore, plays a crucial role in ensuring that moral values remain an integral aspect of our lives. \nIn conclusion, the family, though eroded in the current world, remains a crucial institution in nurturing young people.

On the other hand, growing up in a dysfunctional family environment where there is neglect and abuse, will have a negative impact on the young person\u2019s character and personality. The exposure to prolonged stress or abuse can lead to psychological issues such as anxiety and depression, which can affect the person later in life.\nIn conclusion, the family is a vital institution in shaping the lives of young people.

                "generations.\n\nHowever, it is important to highlight that not all families have the same level of influence on their young people. The impact of the family may be affected by external factors such as social-economic status, cultural background, education level and the availability of support outside the family. Some families may face economic pressures, which means that the parents have to work long hours, thus leaving younger siblings to engage in unproductive activities while the parents are away. In contrast, some families may have more resources, allowing them to provide more opportunities for their young people to learn new skills and values beyond the familial setting.\n\nIn conclusion, the family remains an essential ingredient in nurturing young people. Through the various roles it plays, the family helps to shape the young person\u2019s values, cultural and religious identity and social behaviour. However, it is important to acknowledge that other factors may also have a significant impact on the development of the young person, and therefore families should not be solely responsible for character-building.

In traditional festivals such as Chinese New Year, it is traditional for people to buy furniture and new clothes. Consumer spending increases and thus stimulates the economy. Such festivals also help to keep the family together. In modern society, families tend to be small. Festivals give them a reason to come together to celebrate. For example, Hari Raya Puasa which the Malays celebrate, brings the whole community together not only to celebrate but to do good deeds by donating foodstuffs and money for the less fortunate. Such festivals also enable people to get to know other races and cultivate tolerance and understanding between races.\n\u201cYeo\u2019s, tradition in a can.\u201d This slogan has been used in advertising the glass jelly drink Yeo Hiap Seng has been promoting. Believe it, or not, people have a tendency to favour things from the good old days. Several hotels have been using slogans such as \u201cCome savour the traditional Nonya delicacies\u201d to promote their buffets and turn them into a money-spinning business. Some watches and even cough mixtures boast of traditional methods of manufacture. Nowadays, more and more people are seeking the traditional methods of healing, brewing herbs for several hours and gulping down the dark, foul smelling soup with the bitter taste, as traditional cures are said not to be as \u201charsh\u201d on the body as western drugs.\nTradition is just like drinking Chinese tea. It needs time to be appreciated and is a slow process. Due to the fast pace of modern life we cannot afford to lose time and so we will have to settle for our usual Lipton\u2019s three in-one.

Similarly, during the Ming dynasty era in China, scientific and technological advancements were ignored because they were thought to be destructive to ancient traditions and beliefs. Through this period of self-imposed ignorance and isolation, China lost its pioneering age.\n\nNevertheless, one must understand that tradition is not inherently stagnant. Rather, the nature of tradition is continually changing and evolving. This evolution is evidence that tradition can indeed help progress. It serves as an essential source of identity for many individuals and societies, providing a sense of stability and continuity. Tradition's dynamism allows it to adapt to different situations, providing guidance and support when it is needed, promoting cultural diversity, and helping societies navigate social changes. For example, in Singapore, the integration of Malay culture into the Chinese-dominated society has helped promote racial harmony. If not for these traditions, Singapore would not be the multi-ethnic and multicultural country it is today.\n\nFurthermore, tradition can provide a starting point for progress. Indeed, some of the world's most significant scientific discoveries were made by building on established knowledge from the past. Medical professionals' reliance on traditional remedies in Western medicine is one such example of how progress has been made by building on established knowledge. Modern-day scientists and medical practitioners use traditional knowledge as the foundation of their work. The knowledge gained from traditional remedies often shapes modern treatments. \n\nIn conclusion, there is no straightforward answer to the question of whether tradition hinders progress. While adherence to tradition can impede modernization and evolution in various aspects of life, a nuanced approach to tradition can promote societal growth in other areas. The key lies in recognizing the dynamism inherent in tradition and identifying the aspects that can contribute to progress.

In fact, many companies in Singapore now recognise the importance of family and tradition by giving their employees time off during the festive season.\nIn conclusion, while traditional beliefs and practices may hinder progress in some areas, it is important that we strike a balance between modernisation and tradition. We cannot let go of our roots and cultural heritage, yet we must also embrace change.

Traditional cuisines also serve as a reminder of our cultural heritage and history. Moreover, some traditions like yoga and meditation have been found to have many benefits for our physical and mental health, and thus, they are still highly valued and widely practiced.\nIn conclusion, while tradition may impede progress in some aspects, it is important to acknowledge the value it holds in our lives.

Moreover, traditional values like respecting elders and helping others are important lessons that can still be taught to the younger generation. It is important to strike a balance between tradition and progress, to preserve our roots while moving forward towards a better future.\nIn conclusion, life is constantly changing as we progress into a modern and advanced society.

Certain traditions developed over the years because they were effective and beneficial for human society. It is crucial to distinguish between constructive and destructive traditions, and those that are adaptable or rigid. Progressive societies can preserve and promote constructive traditions while discarding the ones that are no longer relevant.

Prisoners are forced to live in filthy, often crowded cells and the food provided is inadequate. Thus there is a need for better planned prisons with adequate living space for each prisoner. Sanitation and cleaning should be improved. The meals provided should be nutritious since usually prisoners must do some form of work. They should also be suitably paid for this so that when they are released they will have some form of financial support.

This requires a holistic approach where all factors contributing to the criminal's behaviour are considered.

Rather than simply locking up and punishing offenders, society needs to take a more nuanced and holistic approach to the problem. This means focusing on rehabilitation, providing education and vocational training, and fostering a culture of acceptance and understanding. Only by addressing the root causes of criminal behaviour can we create a society that is truly just and fair.",

In fact, rehabilitation efforts should be intensified in cases where repeated offences have occurred.

Prisons should not be places of torture, but rather places for reflection, reform and personal growth. Conditions in prisons need to be humane, so that the basic concept of human rights is not violated.\nIn conclusion, the treatment of criminals is a complex issue which requires a multidimensional approach. Whether it is the liberal approach that emphasises correction and rehabilitation, or the tougher stance that emphasises punishment and deterrence, the primary objective should be to maintain social justice. The key is to find a perfect balance between punishment and reform, so that the criminal can be reintegrated into society as a responsible, law-abiding citizen."

Children can also undertake work in other places and supplement the family income. This practice is com mon in countries with agricultural societies like India. In Pakistan, young children of poor families are sold to car pet makers. Rich families have children to ensure that the family business stays within the family, usually with the eldest child taking over from the father.\nPeople also have children to bring happiness to their lives. Children can be a constant source of pride and joy to their parents.

These young girls will have to look after their husbands and accompany them for the rest of their lives and later these girls are often abandoned by their husbands. In India, girls are also forced to marry young because many families feel that it is too expensive to look after girls. This reveals the selfishness of man. These people force their children to marry some one they do not love or know and this is done without their consent. This problem of early marriage is wide spread in Third World countries, however in most developed countries, children often marry at a mature age and with a freedom to choose their own life partners. For all this I believe the ugly side of man still evident here.\nNowadays children are often neglected by parents and this occurs even in a modern society. Children experience mental and emotional pain in such situations. Once children are neglected by parents, they lack their parental love, warmth, care and guidance. They do not have anyone to nurture them. The children\u2019s minds are not stable and may be easily influenced into bad ways. One main reason why parents neglect their children is that they are too occupied with their office work or too busy pursuing their careers or are involved in less savoury occupations. In a few cases, the parents totally neglect their children\u2019s feelings and limits. They have too high expectations for their children and want them to excel academically. This leads to an absurd amount of pressure and the occasional suicide. This reveals the selfish and ironically uncaring side of parents who are only interested in their work and do not bother about their children but expect them to do well in their studies. For all that, most parents today try to keep their weekends free to accompany their children and provide them with all their love and support. Ugliness is still a feature of man\u2019s nature when these things are missing.\nThere are other unthinkable cases of child abuse. In Thailand and Vietnam, there are children who are kidnapped by some men and parts of their bodies are amputated so that they look like cripples. These children are then forced to be beggars. The money in turn will be collected by those ruthless men. Some babies are killed and their organs are removed and sold to the hospitals for transplant operations. The people who sell the organs are paid a high price. This reveals the cruel and greedy side of man. Despite the fact that the children are suffering physically, some people have no compassion for them.\nThough countries and societies are advancing technologically and economically, man can still be uncivilised.

Governments can work to improve access to education, healthcare, and basic necessities such as food and water. They can also work to address the root causes of poverty and political instability to create a more stable and secure environment for children.\n\nNon-governmental organizations can also play a critical role in addressing the plight of children. They can raise awareness of the issue and work to provide direct assistance to children who are at risk of exploitation and abuse. This can include providing education, shelter, and healthcare to children in need.\n\nIndividuals can also play a role in improving the lives of children. We can support organizations that are working to address the issue of child mistreatment and advocate for policies that protect the rights of children.

To cope with such subversive forces, society might implement even firmer, stricter measures, only to find the subversive force has increased as a result.\nSelf-regulation controls the curiosity and rebellioness of an individual in a way no external authority could. Be cause self-regulation is home of discipline and a firm, entrenched understanding of the undesirable nature of restricted information, curiosity and rebellionness are controlled by these characteristics. In this context, it is the only means of censorship, since other means only intensify the undesirable side effected.\nThe desirable nature of self-regulation may also be seen by comparing the short and long-term effects of this and other means of censorship. As noted before, other means of censorship require dominant authorities to enforce the regulation of materials. In the short-term, these means are far more effective than self-regulation, since self-regulation requires an education of some sort \u2013 be it from the family or the school or some government campaign-to inculcate the proper values of restraint and discipline that render the device effective. In the long term however, these other means of censorship may fail in protecting the psychological and mental health of a people since many things might occur to defeat these authorities. Anew government may be formed, relaxing the regulation in censorship. Wars and natural disasters may read the authorities temporarily paralyzed, but this is sufficient for an explosion of information to hence people\u2019s minds. As a result, the effort and money put into the censorship may be wasted eventually. Now, however where externally-administered agents of censorship falter, self-regulation may ultimately triumph.\nFuelled by personal desire and borne of individual discipline and rectitude, external elements face a psychological wall resistant to penetration. Where new tyrannies may hope to subvert the society, such as dictatorships, the mind is buttressed against the corruption of such subversive ideas, In the long-run, therefore, self-regulation may well be the only means of censorship.\nHowever, the persistency of self-regulation may well stultify the mental growth of an individual. Once one\u2019s mind is narrowed by self-regulation based on a strict doctrine, one loses the open-mindedness needed for creativity, innovation and a general broadening of one\u2019s horizons. This self-regulation, if enforced by the strict bar raging of one\u2019s mind by education, becomes a result of brainwashing. Self-regulation, therefore, to be effective as well as conducive to the individual\u2019s mental growth and development, must also include a general flexibility and open mindedness.\nIn terms of goals to be achieved, self-regulation may well be the only means of censorship. Censorship hopes to train the individual to be a responsible member of society without excessive corrupt influences, and through the exclusion of such influences, strives to create a discerning and responsible individual, well trained in the ideals of moral rectitude and discipline, necessary for social cohesion. Self-regulation, though, is already a product of these ideals-without these it cannot succeed. There fore self-regulation, in being the eventual goal of all forms of censorship, may be the only means of censorship.\nIn conclusion, one may see that self-regulation, while being an intangible asset borne of mental and moral capabilities may be difficult to implement. However, in the light of the general inefficiency of other forms of censor ship, it can be considered the best, if not the only means of censorship. Perhaps it should be noted that self-regulation is best when administered alongside other forms of censorship, each reinforcing the impact of censorship of the other. The only other means of censorship to control people, perhaps, is complete arbitrary control by a single dominant authority, but that would result in a \u201czombified\u201d people \u2013 sluggish and uncreative mentally, and forever backward in innovations and development.\nPerhaps here self-regulation\u2019s greatest benefit is shown: borne of the individuals\u2019 own discernment and moral code, it not only trains the individual in mental toughness and resolution, it allows a wide lassitude for the entrance of new, stimulating ideas, allowing the individual to become well-rounded and complete in his intellectual accomplishments.",

External censorship often involves rigid, one-size-fits-all rules that do not take into account the complexity and diversity of different situations and cultures. In contrast, self-censorship allows for more flexibility and discretion in determining what should be censored and how. This can enable individuals or groups to adapt to changing social or political contexts while also respecting the needs and opinions of different stakeholders. For example, in the realm of social media or online communities, users can develop their own norms and rules of conduct that reflect their shared values and interests, while also allowing for dissent and debate.\n\nDespite the many advantages of self-regulation, there are also some challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. One major concern is that self-censorship may be imposed through social pressure or intimidation rather than genuine introspection or reflection. This can lead to a chilling effect on free expression, where individuals or groups are deterred from expressing themselves or exploring new ideas for fear of being ostracized or attacked. Another concern is that self-regulation may not be effective in situations where there is a power imbalance between different stakeholders, such as when corporations or governments have a dominant influence over media or information flows.\n\nDespite these concerns, I believe that self-regulation remains the most desirable and effective means of censorship in a democratic society. This is because it embodies key democratic values such as autonomy, responsibility, and collective decision-making, while also enabling individuals and communities to balance competing interests and needs.

While other forms of censorship are inhibited by the availability of information and the limitations of external monitoring, self-regulation forms a pervasive and effective force from within the individual. However, it is also important to acknowledge that self-regulation is wholly dependent on the individual\u2019s character and integrity, and can therefore be an ineffective means of censorship if these traits falter.

While it is not a panacea, it has the potential to promote a culture of responsibility, creativity, and innovation, while also respecting the diversity and complexity of human expression. As such, it is an issue that deserves further exploration and debate in our increasingly interconnected and fragmented world.",
                "s for a flexible and responsive approach to censorship. In complex and rapidly changing environments, external censorship may not be able to keep up with new challenges and threats. On the other hand, self-regulation can adapt more quickly and efficiently to changing circumstances, as it relies on a decentralized and bottom-up approach. This means that different communities, industries, or individuals can develop their own self-regulatory mechanisms that are tailored to their specific contexts and needs. For example, social media platforms may adopt user-generated content policies or content moderation algorithms that reflect the preferences and expectations of their users, while also complying with legal and ethical norms.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship can sometimes be necessary to protect public interests, the most effective and desirable form of censorship is self-regulation. By promoting values of responsibility, accountability, participation, and flexibility, self-regulation can ensure that censorship is aligned with democratic norms and human rights, while also promoting creativity, innovation, and diversity. It is therefore important for individuals, organizations, and governments to support and encourage self-regulatory initiatives in different fields and contexts."

            "human_gen_truncate": " Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) be tween the United States and Russia augurs well for world peace.\nEven though critics may argue that a subsequent effect of this is the purchasing of arms by Third World countries, we should not be unduly worried. This is because as many of the weaker countries arm themselves in defense, aggressor nations will be effectively deterred from waging wars. Hence, this redistribution of military might will serve to implement a new world balance of power and probably reduce the chances of a major war.\nAnother reason for optimism is the increasing importance of international trade in our world. As competition for trade intensifies with the rise of many developing countries, countries have never been as reliant on economic co-operation. This helps to divert attention from differences and also allows nations to be open to one another. Moreover, isolation from the global community. would be catastrophic and this subsequently allows space for international diplomacy and pressure to be applied in the name of peace. For instance, North Korea\u2019s initial stand of indifference over the inspection of its nuclear facilities was softened after promises of economic aid, thus removing an impending nuclear crisis.\nFurthermore, with increasing standards of education, many people are learning the need for acceptance and integration with other races and religious groups. The vehement opposition to Neo-Nazis in Germany and the political breakthrough made in Israel-Arab relations are evidence of this. This development has greatly down played racism and ultra-nationalism, ensuring global understanding.\nIn conclusion, the world will always remain under the threat of a global conflict. Peace-keeping efforts should be maintained and complacency must never be allowed to develop. With these in points mind, recent developments should have reduced the likelihood of a Third World War.",

With the major powers so heavily invested in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, any misstep in these two areas could trigger an all-out conflict.\n\nThe development of new technology is another factor that could make a Third World War increasingly likely. The proliferation of cyber-attacks has already started to cause significant damage. The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, which affected systems in countries such as the UK, Russia, and China, highlighted the potential for cybercrime to cause harm on a global scale. Furthermore, there are concerns that artificial intelligence could be used to develop autonomous weapons that could operate with minimal human intervention. This could lead to a dystopian future where the inherent lack of understanding and emotions in machines could lead to acts of aggression that would be counterproductive to human survival.\n\nHowever, as dangerous as these developments are, it is important to note that a Third World War is not inevitable. Diplomacy, mutual respect, and dialogue are the key to preventing a global conflict. Nations need to work together, not against each other, in order to solve the challenges facing the world. That means respecting the global rules-based system and working towards international cooperation. The world needs to remember that there are no true winners in a war, only losers.\n\nIn conclusion, recent world developments have made a Third World War more likely. The rise of populist leaders, regional conflicts, the arms race, and new technologies all threaten to undermine the stability of the world order. It is up to the leaders of the world to recognize the danger and work together to prevent a global conflict. As the global community looks ahead to the future of humanity, it is clear that a Third World War would be devastating for all involved. Only through cooperation and communication can we hope to ensure a stable and hopeful future for the next generation.",

Additionally, the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has already prevented several countries from developing nuclear weapons and has limited the number of countries possessing nuclear warheads. All these measures indicate that nations are taking the threat of global war seriously and are actively working to avert it.\nIn conclusion, the world today may still have pockets of conflict and unrest, but the efforts made by the UN, NATO and others in fostering peace and co-operation internationally are immense. Coupled with the recognition of the immense destructive power of modern weapons, it is evident that the threat of global war is diminishing. I believe that it is only through cooperation and peace that we can ensure growth and prosperity for all nations, and ultimately raise the standard of living for everyone.",
                "United States and Russia have both made significant cuts to their nuclear arsenals. This reduction of arms has greatly reduced the likelihood of global war, as the prospect of mutually assured destruction no longer looms large. Furthermore, advanced technology has also facilitated the establishment of communication channels among nations, making it easier to resolve disputes peacefully. The use of social media, for instance, has revolutionized the way people communicate their grievances, and nations are able to get instantaneous feedback from their citizens.\nIn conclusion, while there are still pockets of conflict in the world, there is evidence to suggest that the world is becoming a better place. With international organizations working hard to ease tensions, the reduction of arms, and advanced communication technology, the threat of a global war is becoming more remote. However, we must not be complacent, as the underlying causes of conflict still remain. We must continue to work towards understanding, tolerance, diplomacy, and promote peaceful coexistence, for a brighter future for all.",
                "United States and Russia, which used to have an arms race, have engaged in several arms control agreements and have signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) to reduce nuclear weapons. This has created a more stable and secure world, reducing the likelihood of an all-out global war or nuclear conflict.\nFurthermore, the advances in technology have allowed for greater communication and economic interdependence. The world has become more connected than ever before, and this interdependence has made it economically irrational for nations to engage in wars. The global trade network has also allowed for countries to rely on each other for resources and goods, further reducing the necessity for armed conflict.\nIn conclusion, with increased efforts for peace, reduced tensions between nations, arms control agreements and economic interdependence, the likelihood of a global war seems to be diminishing. However, we must remain vigilant and continue to work towards maintaining peace in the world. As Mahatma Gandhi once said, \"Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to handle conflict by peaceful means.\"",
                "START I and START II agreements between the United States of America and Russia reduced their nuclear stockpiles significantly. Similarly, the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Ottawa Convention have strongly reduced the production, storage and use of chemical and land mines respectively. With these treaties comes a stronger international resolve against the use of weapons of mass destruction, and consequently, less probable risk of global war.\nAdvancements in communication, transportation and trade have also brought us closer as a human race. The internet has revolutionized the way we receive information and communicate with one another, while increased air travel has made it easier for people to travel between countries at a more affordable price. Coupling this with the rise of multinational corporations, the world's economies have become increasingly interdependent. As a result, countries are more likely to seek peaceful solutions to disputes, rather than risk disrupting the global economy by engaging in war.\nIn conclusion, while the possibility of another global war cannot be completely eliminated, it is becoming increasingly unlikely. The UN and international treaties have fostered international co-operation and peace, while the end of the Cold War has reduced tensions and arms. The world has become more interdependent, with the rise of communication, transportation and trade, and so countries are more likely to seek diplomatic solutions to conflicts. We must continue to work towards international peace, but the prospect of a third world war is becoming more and more remote.",
                "START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty) agreements between the United States and Russia have resulted in a reduction of nuclear warheads. Furthermore, countries such as South Africa, which had previously possessed nuclear weapons, have since dismantled them. This reduction in arms will undoubtedly decrease tensions between major powers.\nTechnological advancements have also contributed to the world's increasing interdependence, which further decreases the probability of war. For instance, the internet has resulted in the birth of an interconnected, global society where people of diverse nationalities work together even though they may be thousands of miles apart. Similarly, the worldwide trend towards economic liberalization and the free flow of goods and capital have brought people of different backgrounds, cultures, and ideologies together. Through interdependence, people become less likely to initiate hostilities, as their economies rely on each other.\nIn conclusion, the threat of a global war (WW3) remains in the realm of possibilities, but it is increasingly improbable due to the progress achieved in international relations since the end of the Second World War. Moreover, the world is becoming increasingly interconnected through recent political, economic, and technological advancements. This interconnectedness, coupled with intensified international cooperation, has decreased tensions between nations. Therefore, I remain optimistic that the world can move towards a more peaceful, collaborative future.",
                "USA and Russia have both cut down their nuclear arsenal, reducing the possibility of nuclear warfare. This is significant as nuclear weapons pose not only a threat to the country they are aimed at, but also to the entire world. Furthermore, countries are increasingly realising the importance of international co-operation in tackling global issues such as climate change, terrorism and pandemics. The Paris Agreement on climate change and the Geneva Convention on terrorism are examples of how countries are working together for the betterment of the world.\nIn conclusion, while the threat of a global war cannot be entirely discounted, it is clear that the world today is more peaceful than it was in the past. The efforts of the UN, the end of the Cold War and the reduction of arms have all contributed to a more peaceful world. While there are still tensions and conflicts in some parts of the world, it is important to remember that significant progress has been made towards global peace. As such, we must continue to promote international co-operation as a means to resolve conflicts and create a better future for all of us.",

Moreover, the development of mutual economic interdependence between nations further strengthens international co-operation. Countries have quickly learnt that economic relations between nations contribute to a more stable and peaceful international environment.\nHowever, it is important to note that globalization and communication technology have not been all rosy in ensuring global peace. The rise of extremist ideologies and nationalism still pose a threat to world peace. For instance, the rise of populist leaders and the US-China trade war are potential catalysts for a global conflict. Ironically, globalization and communication have facilitated the spread of fake news, which has the power to manipulate public opinion and incite violence.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the threat of a global war is not as imminent as it once was. The world has grown wiser and more connected, leading to the forging of new international relationships that promote co-operation, peace and stability. However, vigilance is necessary as there are still factors that could potentially lead to a global conflict. It is up to each individual to play their part in promoting peace and harmony, even during these times of uncertainty.",

The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) has also implemented arms control treaties between member states. These efforts have helped to reduce the proliferation of deadly weapons and increased international trust.\nIn addition, the global economy has become increasingly interdependent. Economic co-operation is likely to prevent countries from engaging in war for fear of losing vital economic trade. Further, powerful countries are finding it harder to act alone in the world without alienating their allies. Examples of these efforts include the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and other regional free trade agreements, such as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which bind trading nations together and reduce the fear of war as an economic deterrent.\nIn conclusion, the threat of a global war is becoming less and less realistic. The development of the UN, the thawing of the Cold War tensions, disarmament, economic co-operation, and increasing international trust, indicate that all nations are coming to realise that co-operation is essential for peace. The world has come a long way from the bloodshed of the twentieth century, and I am confident that we will continue to progress towards global peace and security in the years to come.",

The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which aims to stop nuclear testing, and the convention on the prohibition of chemical weapons, are evidence of this trend.\nMoreover, the rise of globalisation and international trade has created a network of interdependence that promotes co- operation and peace. Countries are keen to maintain good diplomatic and trade relations with one another, and this has promoted peaceful resolutions to disputes, and reduced the likelihood of conflicts escalating into full-blown wars.\nIn conclusion, while the threat of a global war remains real, it is becoming increasingly distant. The international community has learnt from past mistakes, and is increasingly committed to maintaining peace, through organisations such as the UN. The reduction of tensions between major powers, arms control and the rise of globalisation, has fostered a sense of interdependence, co-operation and dialogue, which is essential in achieving lasting peace.",

The world is now seeing a reduction in the number of nuclear weapons, which is a significant step towards disarmament. This makes the possibility of a global war weaker as the world possesses fewer weapons of mass destruction.\nMoreover, economic interdependence among countries has also grown, as trade and investments promote closer ties. International trade has replaced the notion of conquest and expansion, as countries now seek to integrate economically through trade agreements, such as the ASEAN Free Trade Area, and regional economic co-operation agreements. This has generated greater global stability and a sense of common purpose among nations.\nIn conclusion, although the threat of a global war still exists, the world is rapidly moving away from this possibility. The UN has done a remarkable job in reducing conflicts, the end of the Cold War has led to disarmament, and an increase in economic interdependence has brought countries closer together. It is now up to the world's leaders to continue to promote international co-operation and to deter aggression, so that the threat of a global war remains irrelevant."

This has caused countries to resort to protectionist measures and an inward-looking approach, which can escalate into a full-blown conflict. The ongoing trade war between the US and China is a prime example of how economic friction can escalate, with both countries imposing billions of dollars worth of tariffs on each other's goods.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is at a crossroads, and the current political climate has made a Third World War more likely than ever before. The rise of populist leaders, an arms race between major powers, and economic challenges are all potential flashpoints that could ignite a global conflict.

In the Arctic, for example, melting ice has opened up new shipping lanes and access to previously unattainable resources, such as oil and gas. Several nations have already staked claims to the region, and as the ice continues to melt, the competition for resources is likely to intensify.\n\nIn conclusion, there is no doubt that recent world developments have made a Third World War more likely than at any time since the end of the Cold War. Rising nationalism, the arms race, and climate change are all contributing to a more volatile global stage, and the world urgently needs leaders who are committed to maintaining peace and diplomacy.

These challenges require a global response, but with a rising trend towards nation-first policies, cooperation between nations is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve.\n\nIn conclusion, the recent political and economic developments around the world have made a Third World War more likely. The rise of populism, coupled with nationalist policies and the arms race between major powers, are all factors that could lead to global conflict.

Globalization has brought about an unprecedented level of economic interdependence, but it has also created a climate where countries are looking to protect their own interests, often at the expense of others. Trade wars, such as the ongoing one between the US and China, have the potential to escalate into something much more dangerous, as nations resort to increasingly aggressive measures to secure their markets and resources. Economic sanctions, currency devaluations, and the formation of economic blocs are just some examples of how economic competition can contribute to a global conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is facing an uncertain future, marked by rising nationalism, populism, militarization, economic competition, and an erosion of traditional international norms. The dangers of a global conflict should not be taken lightly, and it is imperative that world leaders recognize the gravity of the situation and take meaningful steps to prevent it.

These issues often create fertile ground for nationalist movements, which, in turn, can lead to xenophobia and diplomatic friction.\n\nThe only way to avert a Third World War is for nations to engage in sincere dialogue and find peaceful solutions to political disagreements. International organizations such as the United Nations are crucial in this effort, and nations should work together to strengthen them.

However, it is facing an existential crisis as its authority has been questioned and its funding has been cut. Some nations, such as the US, have even withdrawn from some UN bodies, making it harder for the organization to fulfill its mandate. The lack of a strong global institution that can mediate disputes and prevent conflicts from spiraling out of control is a worrying development that could make the world a more dangerous place.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is currently facing several challenges that could lead to a global conflict. Rising nationalism, populism, arms races, and the erosion of international institutions are all contributing to a world that is becoming more unstable.

With globalization and free trade rapidly expanding over the past few decades, economic interdependence was seen as a key factor which would make large-scale conflict unthinkable. However, increased protectionism, tariffs, and sanctions have significantly upended this dynamic. The ongoing trade war between the US and China, in particular, has destabilized the global economy and increased distrust between the two superpowers. This could eventually lead to conflict, especially if diplomatic channels break down.\n\nIn conclusion, a Third World War is not an inevitability, but it is certainly a possibility if current trends persist. It is essential for world leaders to acknowledge this reality and take proactive steps to prevent it, such as strengthening international institutions, promoting diplomacy over unilateralism and working towards sustainable development for all nations.

                "lead to inefficiencies and high prices for consumers.\nAnother form of regional cooperation is political cooperation. By working together on political matters, regional countries can help to ensure that their interests are protected and their voices are heard on the world stage. The European Union, for instance, has become a powerful player in international diplomacy, both in terms of its economic clout and its ability to speak with a single voice on important issues. In addition to economic and political cooperation, social and cultural cooperation is also important. By sharing their cultural experiences, people can learn to appreciate each other\u2019s differences and work together towards common goals.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation has become increasingly important in today\u2019s interconnected world. Whether it is through economic, political, social or cultural means, regional cooperation can help to ensure that member countries enjoy mutual benefits and prosperity. While there are challenges to be overcome, the potential rewards are too great to ignore. As such, it is crucial that countries continue to work together to build strong, vibrant and enduring regional organisations.",
                "lead to inefficient use of resources and ultimately, to economic stagnation.\nApart from economic cooperation, regional cooperation can also take on a political or social aspect. The European Union is a prime example of a regional organisation that encompasses political cooperation to a great extent. The EU has its own parliament and court of law, and also aims to introduce a single European currency. The ASEAN, on the other hand, is moving towards political cooperation by forming a regional security framework known as the ASEAN Regional Forum. Such political cooperation is effective in resolving conflicts that may arise within the region. For instance, the five Central American republics agreed, under the guidance of the Organisation of American States, to co-operate in resolving disputes over borders, trade and development. This was necessary as the number of inter-state disputes was increasing.\nSocial cooperation is another form of regional cooperation, which includes issues like health care, education and other social welfare programmes. For example, CARICOM\u2019s Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute believes that food production and distribution should be shared regionally as it saves costs while ensuring a stable supply of food for the region.\n\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is essential in today's increasingly interconnected world. Economic, political and social cooperation serve as important avenues for resolving disputes and ensuring the overall welfare of the region. However, it is important that such cooperation is carried out transparently and in line with international free trade policies, to avoid harmful regional isolation.",

In 1995, ASEAN launched the ASEAN Regional Forum, which brings together 27 countries in the Asia-Pacific region, including the United States and China, to discuss security issues and build trust and confidence among its members.\nIn conclusion, while regional cooperation has its benefits, it is important for regional organisations to work towards a fair and open system that benefits not only its members but also the wider international community. By doing so, we can work towards achieving regional stability and prosperity, while promoting global economic growth and cooperation.",
                "lead to retaliation from other countries and consequently, a reduction of exports and employment opportunities in the long run.\nApart from economic cooperation, there are also regional organisations with the purpose of improving security and political stability in the region. An example of such an organisation is the African Union. Since its establishment, the African Union has played a crucial role in resolving conflicts and promoting peacekeeping in the African continent. It aims to address challenges faced by the continent in various areas such as governance, security and economic development.\nRegional cooperation also has benefits beyond just the economic and political spheres. It can promote cultural exchange, and enhance friendships among people of different countries within the region. This can be seen in the annual ASEAN games, where athletes from the different member countries compete with one another. Such events foster understanding and build relationships between people of different nationalities.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation has proven to be crucial in fostering economic growth, improving security and promoting cultural exchange. While it is important for countries to cooperate with one another, it is also crucial that such cooperation is not carried out at the expense of other countries or blocs. Ultimately, regional cooperation should be to the benefit of all parties involved.",

This involves countries coming together to address common regional issues such as terrorism, transnational crimes and environmental issues. The ASEAN Regional Forum and the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation are examples of regional organisations that prioritize political and security cooperation. Through the sharing of information, intelligence and joint exercises, member countries can build stronger ties and trust among themselves. In the event of a crisis, they will be able to better coordinate their response and minimize damage.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is crucial for the development and stability of a region. Through economic, political and security cooperation, member countries can achieve mutual benefits while addressing common concerns. Nonetheless, it is important to ensure that such cooperation does not lead to discrimination or protectionism against countries outside the region, and instead fosters a more open and interconnected global community.",
                "lead to retaliatory measures from the rest of the world and a loss of competitiveness.\n\nAside from economic cooperation, regional organisations also cooperate in areas such as security and environmental issues. In the case of security, regional organisations often work together to address common threats such as terrorism or transnational crime. Cooperation on environmental issues is also important as environmental problems often affect more than one country in the region. For instance, the haze caused by forest fires in Indonesia often spreads to neighbouring countries like Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand.\n\nRegional cooperation, therefore, has many benefits. It allows countries in the region to pool resources and expertise, leading to more efficient use of resources and better outcomes. It also promotes peace, stability and security in the region. Regional organisations provide a forum for countries to discuss issues of common concern and to work together to find solutions. Ultimately, regional cooperation can lead to greater economic prosperity, social development and improved quality of life for people in the region."

He was not at all swayed by opinions that reflected the superstition of common people and even confidently predicted that the area where Tang\u2019s Shopping Centre was to be built would in future, become a busy and crowded place full of shoppers, and it did. It was this helicopter vision and faith in his choice that led Mr CK Tang to be one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Singapore. Good entrepreneurs should emulate this striking example.\nI also think that shrewdness must be an inherent quality in a good entrepreneur. This is because in business there will be certain subtle advantages and traps which must be discerned by a shrewd entrepreneur and used to his best advantage. If an entrepreneur cannot detect these subtleties, it is unlikely that he will be able to succeed because he is handicapped in the ability to grasp golden opportunities.\nA good entrepreneur must be shrewd enough to anticipate beneficial changes and grasp them. He must be prepared for certain danger and treachery and avoid falling into business traps that may ruin him. With shrewd ness, and an opportunistic nature, a good entrepreneur is always one step ahead of others in the competitive business world and thus is on his way up the ladder of success.\nInterpersonal skills are also important for a good entrepreneur. There is lot of interaction in the commercial arena and whether a businessman can successfully clinch a business deal depends a lot on his communication skills. A good entrepreneur must be well-skilled to detect nuances in body language, and speech patterns so as to manipulate them to his benefit. He must also know how to present himself and his proposals favourably because physical impressions do count in the business world. A good entrepreneur should understand the importance of public relations skills and work hard to acquire them.\nAlthough the above points will undoubtedly make an entrepreneur both successful, efficient and to a certain extent \u201cgood\u201d, I think a last vital point to turn the entrepreneur into a really \u201cgood\u201d one is a good heart. By this, I mean that the entrepreneur must be compassionate and contribute frequently to charity when he is successful. He must be honest and not try to cheat others, which might bring about his own downfall. Moral values should be rooted in him such that he will not resort to illegal or immoral activities to lead him up the ladder of success. He must show his gratitude to people who helped to make him successful and also to society as a whole for giving him a chance to prove himself.\nA good entrepreneur is not too obsessed with profits to be neglectful of his social responsibilities. Indeed, he tries not only to look after his own welfare but also that of society. Such an entrepreneur is not only \u201cgood\u201d, he is excellent.",

They are able to inspire their team and communicate their ideas clearly. They are persuasive and able to sell their vision to investors, customers, and suppliers. This is particularly important for entrepreneurs who need to convince others to support their venture, whether it is through securing financing or building a customer base.\n\nLastly, good entrepreneurs are resilient.

They are persistent and have the tenacity to push through challenging times.\n\nIn conclusion, becoming a successful entrepreneur is a challenging but rewarding venture. Good entrepreneurs possess a combination of characteristics, including a thorough understanding of their industry, a willingness to take risks, a strong drive and motivation, adaptability, effective communication skills, and resilience.

            "human_gen_truncate": "n dispense with space. This magical aspect of art should be something we must treasure, and not simply label it as some pernicious and undesirable.\nArt epitomises man\u2019s wisdom and his innate ability to put his ideas thoughts and perceptions into evocative symbols or representatives that transmit certain meaningful messages. Undoubtedly, it enhances interaction between people in the sense that people can communicate through time and space through those art pieces and works. With out art, interpersonal relationships can never be fostered, since all of people\u2019s endeavours and pursuits would be centred or based on materialistic attainments and sati faction. Therefore, art is useful to us in that it closes the gap and fills up the chasm between people, thus bringing them together. Of course, one need not be sensitive, erudite or have the minds or eyes of a connoisseur to appreciate art. In fact, art is all around us, and even in its most pristine and simplest form, it can make us realize that there is a value to living, depending only on whether we are observant or not. Thus, art has a value and that value often manifests itself in its usefulness.\nOf course, there are some forms of art that do not enhance our lives, but have detrimental effects on us. Examples of these are pornography and unhealthy drawings, caricatures and portrayals that are done for defamatory or inflammatory purposes or to arouse and stimulate those undesirable feelings latent in us. In addition, decadent music will lead to degeneracy that have adverse psycho logical influences on the individual. These forms of art should definitely not be encouraged and propagated among the masses. But they constitute only a minor portion of all those things encompassed in the realm and sphere of art. Oscar Wilde\u2019s \u201cAll art is useless\u201d is certainly an overstatement and implies an attitude too intransigient. The word \u2018Art\u2019 and its contents should not be seen as totally useless or even sordid just because some forms of art are useless, or are to some extent, undesirable due to the fact that their degree of utilization is limited and their nature questionable.\nSince art has been passed on from one generation to generation another, it is apparent to us that unless it possesses certain qualities that are worth preserving, it could not have became the legacy of mankind. With due consideration to this, should we look at the picture from a broad perspective and recognise its real value and use fulness instead of combing it inch by inch for its flaws and stigmas?",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "at supports the belief that art is useless is that it does not have a specific function in society. Unlike science or technology, which offer practical solutions to real-life problems, art does not have an explicit function in society. It does not produce anything tangible and does not generate direct profits. However, it leaves intangible and long-lasting impressions on human beings. Art has the power to inspire, to challenge, to motivate, and to enrich our lives. It can change our perspectives and offer new insights into the world around us.\n\nFurthermore, Wilde implies that the value of art lies in its beauty and aesthetic qualities rather than its usefulness. Therefore, the value of art cannot be measured by its instrumental purpose or by the benefits it provides. It is not something that justifies its existence through its utility. Instead, Wilde argues that art is valuable because of its ability to evoke emotions, express ideas, challenge conventions, and stimulate the imagination. It is the experience of art that makes it meaningful, rather than its material effects. The aesthetic qualities of art transcend utility, making it something that has intrinsic value.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that \"all art is useless\" might initially seem contentious, but upon reflection, one can see that it is a profound truth about the nature of art. Art is not meant to serve any practical purpose; it is created purely for the sake of itself. The value and meaning of art lie in its ability to evoke emotions and express ideas rather than its utility. Therefore, art critics and enthusiasts should not view art merely through its instrumental value but should admire its aesthetic qualities and appreciate the unique experiences it provides.

                "at supporters of the idea that art is useless make is that art is not created to convey a message or to influence people's behavior. In other words, art is not propaganda. While political and social messages can sometimes be found in art, this is not what it is intended for. Art is not meant to convince people of anything or to serve as a tool for manipulation. Instead, it is meant to provoke thought, to inspire reflection and to encourage people to question their own beliefs and assumptions.\n\nOverall, while it might seem contradictory on the surface, Oscar Wilde's assertion that \"All art is useless\" is actually a profound statement about the value of art. When we view art as something that is valuable only if it serves a practical purpose or if it entertains us, we miss the point. Art is not meant to be useful in that sense. It is meant to be appreciated for its own sake and to be a testament to human imagination, creativity, and emotion. It is a way of capturing something that would otherwise remain unexpressed and intangible, and for that reason, its value cannot be measured in terms of its utility.",
                "at Wilde makes to support his claim is that art is not created to solve practical problems or to bring about social change. He argues that art is not a means to an end but an end in itself. For example, a sculpture might not provide any practical solution to a societal issue, but it could convey powerful messages about the human experience. In this way, art acts as a reflection of society, offering a critique of it and a means for individuals to make sense of their world and their place in it.\n\nFurthermore, Wilde suggests that the intrinsic value of art lies in its ability to provide individuals with moments of transcendence. He argues that art allows people to step out of their daily lives and enter into a contemplative state where they can reflect on their existence, their emotions, and their thoughts. These moments of transcendence can be transformative and incredibly powerful, as they can provide individuals with a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that \"All art is useless\" is not a dismissal of the value of art but rather an assertion about its true purpose. Wilde argues that the value of art lies in its intrinsic qualities and its ability to evoke emotions and insights. While art may not solve practical problems, it offers individuals moments of transcendence, allows them to reflect on their world and their place in it, and acts as a reflection of society. Therefore, art is not useless but essential for human expression, communication, and growth.",

In this sense, art can be seen as a means of celebrating the complexity and richness of the human experience. Art is not merely a product that can be bought or sold but rather an expression of the individuality and uniqueness of each artist. Therefore, even if art may not have any practical value, its beauty and aesthetic qualities make it valuable in itself.\n\nFinally, the idea that all art is useless might seem paradoxical, but it is not entirely unfounded. Although art might not have any immediate practical applications, it can have a more profound impact on society. For instance, art can be a means of expressing social and political views or reflecting on important issues that humanity faces. Art can also be used as a powerful tool for social and cultural change, inspiring people to think, feel, and act differently towards various issues.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that all art is useless is not to be taken too literally. Although art might not have any immediate effects, its ability to evoke emotions, thoughts, and ideas makes it valuable in promoting greater understanding and compassion in the world. Art reflects the richness and complexity of the human experience, and its creation is a celebration of human creativity and individuality.

Instead, art should be appreciated for what it is - a form of human expression that transcends morality, logic, and reason.\n\nMoreover, Oscar Wilde believed that art is not meant to be practical or utilitarian. Art should not be created to fulfill a specific need or solve a particular problem. Instead, art should be a product of human imagination and creativity, free from any constraints or limitations. Art should not be judged based on its usefulness or utility, but rather on its ability to evoke emotions and inspire people.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that \"all art is useless\" is not meant to be taken literally.

Many people might argue that art is only valuable if it can be used for something, such as to decorate a room or to inspire a scientific discovery.

Art, in its purest form, is a way of expressing the human experience and connecting people across time and space. It is a means of transcendence and a way of communicating the deepest aspects of our humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that \"All art is useless,\" is a thought-provoking assertion that forces us to rethink the purpose and value of art. Although it might seem superficially absurd, it highlights an essential aspect of art: its inherent worthlessness. Art is not meant to serve any practical or functional purpose.

They argue that art has the power to educate, to influence, and to shape public opinion. Furthermore, art can serve as a form of social criticism, and can challenge the status quo, and bring about social change. While this may be true, Wilde's claim that art is useless is still valid.

In the Third World countries, women usually work for more hours than men but despite this fact, they are still seen as the weaker sex as they are paid very little for their work, that is, if they are paid at all. In certain countries such as India, traditional marriage customs have it that the woman\u2019s family has to pay a huge dowry to the husband for the husband to take care of the wife, indicating that the wife is incapable of taking care of herself. In other countries such as European countries, should a marriage end in divorce, the husband is often required to pay alimony to the wife as it is thought that the wife may be unable to survive independently. For centuries, husbands were the breadwinners. Today, even though more women are going out to work, the wives still get allowances from their husbands, who felt that it is their responsibility to provide for their wives, who are the weaker sex.\nIn the past, women were not allowed to participate in politics as they were considered incapable of handling such matters. Even today, far fewer women are active in politics than men. The Prime Minister of Pakistan is one of the few. In Singapore, there is only one female member in the parliament (that has change since. Halimah was sworn in on 14 September 2017 as the 8th President at The Istana.) Much of this situation can be attributed to the sensitive and emotional nature of women which renders them less suitable candidates for politics as they are more prone to mix feelings with work. On the other hand, however, women are more caring and have keener minds which allows them to observe an issue from many different points of view and thus to make better decisions on the best action to take. However, even though women have this advantage, not many women are willing to go into politics and also few people, especially men, are able to accept female leaders. As such, women are the weaker sex.\nIn conclusion, women can be seen to be weaker than men in physical, psychological, economic and political aspects.

This shows that women can excel in any field as long as they are given equal opportunities and a level playing field.\n\nMoreover, women have demonstrated exceptional strength and resilience in the face of adversity. Women have historically been subjected to various forms of violence, including rape, domestic abuse, and sex trafficking.

In most countries, women earn less than men for doing the same job. The gender pay gap is a persistent issue that has yet to be adequately addressed. Women are also more likely to work part-time or have gaps in their employment due to family responsibilities, which puts them at a disadvantage as their male counterparts have more work experience. This in turn affects their earning potential and career progression. In addition, women have to bear the cost of periods and childbirth, which can be expensive and lead to lost workdays. This economic disadvantage further reinforces the perception of women as the weaker sex.\n\nFinally, women are also politically weaker. In many countries, women are under-represented in politics and leadership roles. In Singapore, for example, there are only 29 female Members of Parliament out of 100.

Part of the reason for this could be attributed to the fact that women are more likely to choose careers that are deemed \u2018feminine\u2019, such as nursing and teaching, which offer lower pay than more male-dominated fields. Discrimination and bias in the hiring process also contribute to the gender pay gap. Women are often passed over for job opportunities or promotions in favor of men due to the perception that women are less capable or committed to their careers because of their roles as caretakers of children and households. This economic disadvantage further perpetuates the belief that women are weaker than men.\n\nFinally, women are also marginalized in politics, leading to their weaker position in societal power structures. Women are underrepresented in government, with fewer women holding political office than men. This underrepresentation limits women\u2019s ability to shape policies that affect their lives and interests. Women\u2019s participation in politics is also limited by patriarchal societies that prioritize male voices over female ones. Furthermore, women are often subject to discriminatory laws and policies, such as restrictive reproductive rights laws and laws that disadvantage women in the workplace.\n\nIn conclusion, the perception of women as the weaker sex is based on societal expectations and biological differences. These perceptions are reinforced by institutional biases and cultural stereotypes. Women can overcome these challenges by advocating for their rights and challenging gender norms. Increased representation in politics and the workforce, as well as equal pay for equal work, can help to break down these barriers and change the narrative around women\u2019s strength and capabilities.",

Furthermore, external factors such as gender discrimination and domestic violence may lead to women feeling inferior and powerless, which could further contribute to their mental health issues.\nIn terms of economics, women are generally paid less than men, even when doing the same job. In many societies, men are still expected to be breadwinners while women are expected to be homemakers. This results in women having fewer opportunities to advance in their careers, and they are often limited to low-paying jobs that are less valued by society. Furthermore, women are more likely to be employed in part-time or temporary jobs which are less stable and do not come with benefits such as maternity leave. These economic inequalities result in women being financially dependent on men and this could contribute to why they are often seen as the weaker sex.\nFinally, women are also politically weaker as they are underrepresented in positions of power. In many countries, women make up less than a third of the parliament, and there are hardly any women in the top leadership roles. This lack of representation means that women\u2019s perspectives and needs are not properly addressed in policy-making. Furthermore, women are often subject to gender-based violence and discrimination, which further impedes their participation in politics.\n\nIn conclusion, women are still seen as the weaker sex today, and this is due to factors such as physical differences, psychological differences, economic inequalities and political under-representation. However, it is important to recognize the strengths and contributions of women and to work towards gender equality so that everyone can have equal opportunities and rights, regardless of their gender.",

However, it is important to note that traits that are often associated with femininity, such as empathy and nurturing, can also be advantageous in many fields. For instance, nursing and teaching require individuals who are attuned to the emotions and needs of others, and women may excel in such professions due to their emotional intelligence. Additionally, traits such as perseverance and resilience, which are often linked with mental strength, are not exclusive to men and can be found in both genders.\nIn terms of the political aspect, women are underrepresented in many countries, including Singapore. The political arena is widely considered to be a male-dominated domain and as such, women are often seen as less capable of handling positions of power. In Singapore, only 29% of parliamentarians are women, and this is far from gender parity. Singapore has made significant strides in this area through initiatives such as the Women's Charter and the formation of the Council of Women's Organisations. However, there is still much work to be done to ensure that women are not seen as weak and that opportunities are given based on merit and not gender.\nOverall, it is clear that the perception of women as the weaker sex has persisted across different domains, including physical, psychological, economic and political aspects. However, it is important to acknowledge that this perception is a product of societal constructs rather than inherent differences between genders. While women may face certain challenges due to their gender, it does not necessarily mean that they are weak. Women have made significant contributions to society throughout history, and it is time to recognise their strengths and abilities beyond gender stereotypes.",

Women are often paid less than men for the same job and sometimes even for a higher qualification. This perpetuates the stereotype that women are less competent and more expendable in the workplace. Women\u2019s careers also suffer due to the lack of maternity leave and flexible work arrangements. Discrimination against women in the workforce has a domino effect on their financial independence and social status.\n\nLastly, women\u2019s political participation and representation have been limited in many countries due to gender biases. Women often face tremendous obstacles when trying to enter politics. Patriarchal societies, lack of financial backing and long-standing cultural perceptions about gender roles continue to discourage women from getting involved in politics. Even when women do manage to enter politics, they are often sidelined and not taken seriously by their male counterparts.\n\nIn conclusion, despite progress in gender equality, women are still widely considered as the weaker sex. From physical limitations to psychological and socio-economic disadvantages, women have been historically discriminated against across societies. It is imperative to recognize and challenge gender stereotypes and biases in order to achieve true gender equality.",

However, there are women who are mentally stronger than men in terms of resilience and perseverance. It is unfair to make generalizations and say that all women are weaker than men in terms of psychology.\nIn the economical aspect, women who have families may face limitations in their careers due to their role as the primary caregiver. Women also tend to earn less than men for the same job and same level of qualification. This is partly because they do not negotiate for higher salaries and promotions as often as men do, and may also be due to biases against women in the workplace. However, there are women who are successful in their careers and businesses, and some have even broken the glass ceiling by becoming CEOs of major corporations.\nIn the political aspect, women are still underrepresented in many countries. This is partly due to the fact that women are seen as being less capable of leading, and also partly due to factors such as discrimination and social norms. However, there are female politicians who have proven themselves to be effective leaders and have made significant contributions to society.\nIn conclusion, the notion that women are the weaker sex is a problematic and unfair stereotype. While there may be some differences between men and women in terms of physical, psychological, economical, and political aspects, it does not mean that one sex is inherently weaker or less capable than the other.

Society has stereotypical beliefs surrounding gender roles which can often lead to a lack of support and understanding for the unique issues that women may face. Thus, the psychological weakness of women often goes unnoticed or is dismissed.\nEconomically, women are paid less than men even for doing the same job. This may be due to the perception that women are less capable of performing as well as men. However, studies have shown that equal opportunities for both sexes can lead to better performance and increase overall company productivity. The lack of representation of women in top positions also affects their economic prospects. This is due to the preconception that men make better leaders and are therefore, more likely to be promoted to higher positions. As a result, women are limited to a glass ceiling in their professional life.\nFinally, politically, women are underrepresented in political positions. This is because of the stereotype that men are more suited for politics since they are seen as being stronger and more assertive. In some countries, such as Saudi Arabia, women did not have the right to vote until recently. This highlights the discrimination and societal prejudices that have led to gender inequality. This has resulted in women\u2019s issues being overlooked or not taken seriously by policy makers. The lack of representation and support for women in politics further perpetuates the perception that women are the weaker sex.\nIn conclusion, despite the progress made towards gender equality, the perception of women being the weaker sex still persists.

Research has shown that the female hormone, estrogen, affects neurotransmitter levels in the brain, leading to mood instability. This, coupled with a lack of emotional support, can lead to severe depression and even suicide. The perception of women as psychologically weaker than men is a stereotype which needs to be challenged if society is to progress and embrace gender equality.\nIn terms of economics, women are generally paid less for doing the same amount of work as men. This is known as the gender pay gap. Statistics show that in the United States, for example, women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men. The situation is worse in developing countries, where women often face discrimination not only in the workplace but in society at large. Women are also more likely to be in low paid jobs or in part-time work, which makes it more difficult for them to achieve financial independence. All these factors contribute to the perception of women as being economically weaker than men.\nFinally, in politics, women are underrepresented in terms of leadership and decision-making roles. In many countries, women are still not allowed to vote or run for office. Even in countries where women have the right to vote, they are often not encouraged to participate in politics. As a result, there are few women in positions of power and influence. This lack of female representation reinforces the idea that women are less capable than men, which is not true.\nIn conclusion, while there may be some biological and social differences between men and women, the idea that one sex is weaker than the other is not true. Women can be just as physically, psychologically, economically and politically capable as men.

However, with the changing societal norms and the increasing number of women entering the workforce, women are learning to balance family and career, and are now better able to handle work pressure and emotional stress.\nIn terms of the economic aspect, women, until very recently, have faced discrimination in the workplace, where salaries and job promotions are concerned. Women are often paid less than their male counterparts, despite having the same qualifications and experience. This is because, in the past, women were seen as secondary breadwinners, who did not need to earn as much as men. Additionally, many employers had the impression that women would leave the workforce once they got married, therefore, it was not worth investing in their growth in the company. Although the situation has improved slightly, women are still paid lower than men in many countries and industries.\nFinally, in the political sphere, women have been severely underrepresented, with men dominating the political arena. In many countries, women have not been allowed to vote, let alone run for political offices. Even in countries where women have equal voting rights as men, the number of female political leaders is still significantly lower, due to societal norms that place men above women. Women are often seen as emotional and unfit for positions of power, which has hindered their growth in the political sphere.\nIn conclusion, despite the progress made towards gender equality, women are still perceived as the weaker sex, with physical, psychological, economic and political barriers hindering their growth in various aspects of society. However, with changing societal norms and the increased recognition of women's abilities, women are now breaking barriers and creating a path for future generations to follow."

At the moment, no cure has been found for this disease. One of the major reasons it has infected so many people in these countries is pure ignorance. It is the rural people who are the most vulnerable to this disease since the lack of edu cation causes them to be ignorant of the ways of trans mission of AIDS. As I have mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is already hard for the rural poor to obtain a basic education about the prevention of AIDS.\nThe more developed countries definitely have a higher literacy rate than the developing ones. However, this does not mean complacency can be allowed to set in here. The government of the United States of America, for example, has realised that it is now time to do something about its educational system which is plagued with a drop in standards. Critics have condemned the system in which students are assessed using multiple choice questions which they say do not fully test the students\u2019 abilities and intelligence.\nI see the need for governments to let education be their first concern. In the case of developing countries like India, the government should ensure that education is available and affordable for the young. They should improve the infrastructure in the rural areas so that the poor can easily reached by teachers and so schools can be built. A large pool of illiterate young people is inevitably detrimental to the economy and progress of the nation. It is also a waste of human resources.

In a democratic society, an educated populace is better able to hold their leaders accountable and ensure that they act in the best interest of the people.\n\nFourthly, education improves public health outcomes. A well-educated population exhibits better health outcomes due to their increased awareness of healthy practices. For instance, education promotes good hygiene, sensible diets, regular exercise, and responsible sexual behavior, all of which result in better health outcomes. A well-educated populace is also better equipped to understand and cope with public health threats, such as pandemics, as they have an understanding of science and medicine.\n\nConversely, if a government fails to prioritize education, the consequences can be dire. A poorly educated society exhibits acute economic disparities and high unemployment rates, which can lead to social unrest and increased crime rates. Moreover, when the population is not educated, their ability to participate in democratic governance is limited, resulting in a lack of accountability and corruption within the government. Additionally, a poorly educated society is more likely to exhibit poor health outcomes, leading to increased healthcare costs and difficulties in dealing with public health crises.\n\nIn conclusion, education is the cornerstone of any society. It is a fundamental right that should be accessible to all individuals regardless of social or economic background.

The government realised early on that education was the key to the country's survival. With no natural resources, Singapore had to depend on its people to pull through. Therefore, the government began focusing on education and made it a priority. Today, Singapore\u2019s education system is regarded as one of the best in the world.

The government also provides financial assistance to families that cannot afford tuition fees.\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that education plays a crucial role in a country\u2019s economic growth. Governments should focus on providing quality education to their people as it helps to create a skilled workforce, which in turn attracts businesses, improves productivity and results in economic prosperity.

Singapore\u2019s government invests heavily in education. One of the key features of Singapore\u2019s education system is the emphasis on meritocracy. This means that students are rewarded based on their academic success rather than their social status or family background.

In recent years, Singapore\u2019s government has also started to focus on vocational education and training to ensure that individuals have the necessary skills for the job market.

A well-educated population is necessary for economic growth and development. While some countries may argue that defense or healthcare should be their primary concern, I feel that education is essential in order to address the root causes of poverty and inequality.

Firstly, many parents are too poor to support the education of their children, secondly, the schools do not have enough places to take on all the children and thirdly, there is not enough money going into education. In this case, the government should shift its focus from defence to education and allocate more funds to education so that children can have access to good education regardless of their background.\n\nBesides, I believe that education is the key to personal growth and self-improvement. It is not just about learning to read and write or acquiring knowledge for the sake of getting a job, education is also about developing critical thinking skills, learning how to form an opinion, and helping individuals to become good citizens who can contribute positively to society. When people have access to good education it helps to break the cycle of poverty and inequality. In many countries, especially in developing ones, children who come from poor backgrounds have limited opportunities. They are usually limited to low-paying jobs that offer little prospects for upward mobility. But education can change that. With a good education, children from poor families can hope to obtain better job prospects, be more financially stable and help to lift their families out of poverty. Therefore, it is important for governments around the world to devote more resources towards education in order to promote economic growth and social mobility.\n\nIn conclusion, education must be a priority for any government, as the development of human capital is the most important factor in driving economic growth. By prioritizing education, governments can help to ensure that their citizens are equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in the modern world.

In comparison, Singapore wholeheartedly invests into education for the betterment of its people. The government places significant emphasis on developing a strong educational system not just for primary and secondary levels, but also tertiary level education.

Singaporeans are well-educated and highly skilled, which contributed to the success of the country\u2019s economic policies in terms of attracting foreign investment. Singapore has invested a huge amount of money in education, from pre-school level to tertiary education.

Due to this emphasis on education, Singapore has become an economic powerhouse, despite lacking natural resources.\nIn conclusion, education is the fundamental force that drives a country\u2019s economy. A well-educated population can propel forward the growth of the economy, while an under-educated society will only hamper any efforts towards achieving economic growth. Governments should recognize that education is one of their top priorities, and they should make sure that education is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or financial status. Only then can a country achieve long-term economic stability.",
                "labour is still a prevalent issue. Education is not given the attention it deserves in India. Instead, a large amount of the budget is invested in the military and defence sector, which is definitely necessary to protect the country\u2019s sovereignty, but at the expense of the people\u2019s welfare and education.\n\nOn the other hand, countries like Singapore and Japan recognise that their lack of natural resources means their population is their only asset. Therefore, they place a greater emphasis on education. In Singapore, for example, education is highly valued and prioritised. The government provides significant funds for education, ensuring that every child has access to quality education. Additionally, Singapore\u2019s education system is constantly evolving and adapting to the changing world, such as the emphasis on technology and STEM subjects. This ensures that the workforce is able to keep up with the demands of the economy and stay competitive.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that a government\u2019s first priority should be the education of its people. A well-educated population is key in economic growth and development, as well as the overall well-being of the society. Governments need to invest in education to develop the skills and knowledge of their people, enabling them to overcome any challenges that they may face in the world today.",
                "labour is still a serious problem. Many poor families need their children to contribute to the household income, hence depriving them of the opportunity to attend school to receive a basic education.\n\nThe situation is quite different in Singapore. The government here has always recognised that the people are the country\u2019s most valuable asset. As a result, the country has invested heavily in its education system. In fact, education is the second highest area of government spending, after defence. As a small island nation with no natural resources, Singapore has to rely heavily on its human resources in order to compete on the global stage. Therefore, it is crucial that the people of Singapore are well-educated to ensure that they have the skills and knowledge needed to drive economic growth and prosperity.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that education is the key to a country\u2019s success and the most important investment a government can make. While other areas such as defence and healthcare are also important, education comes first as it provides the foundation for all other areas to flourish. A well-educated population is better equipped to contribute to the country\u2019s economy and society, and ultimately improve the overall quality of life for all citizens.",
                "labour is still a very serious issue. Many children, especially those from lower-income families, are forced to drop out to support their families financially. Therefore, I feel that it is imperative for the Indian government to take education as their primary concern and allocate more resources towards it. Improving the education system will not only improve the lives of the people, but it can also help reduce poverty and increase economic growth in the long run.\nSimilarly, Singapore, a small island city-state which is known for its strict laws and high standard of living, has also placed a significant emphasis on education. The country has limited natural resources, so it had to rely on its people to develop and sustain its economy. Therefore, Singapore views education as a crucial tool to develop its human capital and to foster economic growth. The government invests heavily in education, providing its citizens with world-class facilities and educational opportunities. This is evident from the country's high literacy rate and the quality of its workforce.\nIn conclusion, education should be the primary concern of any government as it is crucial for the economic growth and development of a country. Without a well-educated population, no country can achieve long-term prosperity. Countries like India and Singapore have recognized this, and invested heavily in education. Other countries should follow their lead and prioritize education for the betterment of their people and their economies.",
                "labour and inadequate education quality remain major issues. \n\nIn contrast, Singapore has always placed a high priority on education. This small island nation realises that her only resource is people and invests heavily in education every year. From the government\u2019s perspective, the investment is justified as it uplifts the nation\u2019s economy and allows her to stand on par with other developed countries. From the people\u2019s point of view, education is paramount as it opens doors to better job opportunities, higher earnings, and a better quality of life. For example, Singaporean university graduates can earn up to five times more than some of their contemporaries in the region, such as those in Vietnam or the Philippines. This difference is a result of Singaporean graduates being more highly skilled, able to speak English fluently, and more adaptable to changes in the workplace. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that education should be a government\u2019s top priority. A well-educated population translates into a prosperous economy. A country that has plenty of natural resources but no educated workforce will not be able to put those resources to good use. Conversely, a country without any natural resources but with a highly educated workforce can enjoy a flourishing economy. I believe the example of Singapore shows that this is achievable."

A recent article in \u201cUSA Today\u201d, an American periodical, stated that one of the major reasons Clinton won the Presidency was because he was more attractively pack aged (saxophone, blond wife, youthful looks and all) than older and more haggard-looking Bush. Among some of the reasons given for this prevailing emphasis on appearances was the impact that slick, glossy, stylish advertising has on the American population. So now you see how sinister advertising can be.\nMany people claim that advertising is an extremely wasteful industry. To some extent this is very true. With out all that money spent on air-time, research, and hiring of expensive models to advertise products and services, we consumers would pay a much lower price for the things we buy. Also, think of the adverse impact excessive packaging has on the environment. Valuable re sources are used wastefully to make a product look just a little bit better, and end up in landfills or incinerators.\nAdvertising, a multi-million industry, provides a basic function for several thousand people world-wide: that is jobs. For every hundred people that advertisements manipulate there is one bread-winner or wage-earner. Advertising is not as simple as enticing consumers to purchase a product it has a significant impact on the economy too!\nIf advertising can have an adverse impact on many consumers, it can also have a positive effect on more discerning people. What else provides the valuable lesson \u2013 beware of cheats and deceivers \u2013 day in day out? Advertising is a constant reminder to be more wary of insufficiently backed claims and stylish deviousness. People who learn these lessons well can make more intelligent choices and decisions in all areas of their lives.\nSo we see that advertising, in all its forms, makes a gigantic impact on our daily lives. Who would have thought that advertising would have such a wide-reaching and lasting influence?",

This type of advertising can create a detrimental image of what \u201cbeauty and attractiveness\u201d means, which can lead to a negative impact on self-esteem and acceptance of one's body image.\n\nAdditionally, advertising can be manipulative and misleading, particularly regarding health claims. Many companies make claims about their products that are not supported by scientific evidence or else use complex language to mislead consumers. This type of advertisement can deceive consumers into believing the advertised product is a miracle solution, leading to dangerous health outcomes in some instances.\n\nMoreover, advertising can contribute to the rise of consumerism and harmful environmental practices, leading to an issue of sustainability. Advertisements often encourage the over-consumption of goods and services, leading to an increase in waste and unsustainable production practices. In this way, advertising encourages customers to buy more even though they may not necessarily need them. This contributes to increased environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources.\n\nIn conclusion, advertising plays a significant role in our society. It has both positive and negative effects on individuals and society as a whole. While advertising helps promote products and businesses and helps consumers in making informed decisions, it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, be manipulative in its claims, and contribute to environmental waste and unsustainable practices. Therefore, it is important for companies to consider the ethical implications of their advertising practices in developing advertisements that promote their products while still being responsible and sustainable in their messaging.",

Marketers are paid huge sums of money to devise strategies that will turn our heads, and open our wallets. By using persuasive techniques and methods, advertisements can convince us that we need a certain product, when we really don't. While we may think that we are making rational decisions, in reality, we are often being manipulated by advertising messages. As a result, we may end up buying things that we do not really need and regretting our decisions later on.\nIn conclusion, advertising has become an integral part of our lives, shaping our attitudes, beliefs and values. While there are certainly benefits to be gained from effective advertising, it is important to recognise the potential negative effects that it can have on our minds and wallets. As consumers, we need to be more aware of the methods used by marketers, and to make informed decisions based on our own needs and wants, rather than being influenced by slick and persuasive advertising messages.",

This trend has even spread to the food industry where fast food chains manipulate images of their food to look incredibly appetizing, but in reality, they are unhealthy and full of chemicals that harm our bodies. Yet, many of us are still drawn to these fast food chains and end up consuming these products, mainly because of the visual appeal indicated in their advertisements.\nMoreover, advertising is known to breed a culture of materialism where the desire to possess material goods is glorified. Society is bombarded with the notion that one\u2019s worth, image, and identity is determined by material possessions. Thus, many people end up purchasing luxury items they cannot afford with the sole purpose to improve their self-image rather than for its actual usage or benefits. This culture of materialism promotes needless and wasteful consumerism which puts a strain on finite resources on our planet. \nIn conclusion, advertising has woven itself into the fabric of our lives and has an immeasurable impact on our psychological makeup as well as our cultural values. While the pursuit of business and profits cannot be denied, it is essential that advertisers also focus on the responsibility to help shape a society that engages in more responsible consumerism, creates less waste and promotes a culture that values social responsibility over extravagant materialism.",

This has led to a decline in the quality of some products, as manufacturers divert their focus to packaging and promotions rather than improving the actual product itself. \nFurthermore, advertising can sometimes be misleading or even outright dishonest. Claims that a product can make you lose weight or grow taller in a short period of time are often exaggerated or even false, leading to disappointment and sometimes even harm. Many people have also fallen prey to scams disguised as advertisements, losing their hard-earned money or even identity to fraudsters.\nHowever, advertising can also have positive impacts. It can raise awareness of important issues, such as social causes or health campaigns. Advertisements can also provide information that helps consumers make informed decisions, such as nutritional labels on food packaging.\nIn conclusion, advertising is a powerful force that has both positive and negative impacts on society. While it can be persuasive and effective in attracting customers, it is important for consumers to be cautious and discerning when evaluating the claims made in ads. As responsible citizens, we should also be aware of the impact that advertising has on our perceptions and attitudes, and strive to make informed choices that are not solely based on marketing strategies.",

Advertisements play on people\u2019s insecurities and create unrealistic expectations of what one should look like, what cars one should drive, or what the perfect family should be like. This leads to dissatisfaction and disillusionment when the reality does not live up to the idealised expectations created by advertising.\nFurthermore, advertising also perpetuates harmful stereotypes and encourages consumerism. The sexualisation of women in advertisements is a pervasive problem. Men are often portrayed as powerful and dominant while women are objectified and portrayed as passive objects of desire. Moreover, advertisements also encourage consumerism by promoting the idea of materialism and perpetuating the belief that happiness, success, and status can be attained through the acquisition of goods and services.\nIn conclusion, advertisements have a significant impact on our lives and influences our decision making. While they have positive aspects in terms of informing consumers about products and services, they also have negative aspects such as promoting unrealistic expectations, perpetuating harmful stereotypes, and encouraging consumerism.

For example, the \u2018Don\u2019t Drink and Drive\u2019 campaign has helped to reduce the number of drink-driving accidents on Singapore\u2019s roads.\n\nIn conclusion, while advertisements can have both positive and negative impacts on our lives, it is important to be mindful of their influence and to critically evaluate the messages they convey. As consumers, we have the power to choose the products and services we consume, and it is up to us to make informed choices that align with our values and beliefs.

This message, however, is misguided and can cause people to overlook the real joys of life, like love, family, learning, exploration, and adventure.\nIn conclusion, while advertising is not inherently evil, it should be regarded with a degree of scepticism. It is important that we, as members of society, understand the true motivations behind advertisements and the way they can influence our thoughts and behaviours. In doing so, we can guard against being unduly swayed by the messages they present and establish priorities that are more conducive to individual and societal wellbeing.",

Hence, the danger of advertising lies in its potential to mislead and deceive, causing consumers to make poor choices.\nFurthermore, advertising is often used to promote consumptive lifestyles, encouraging over consumption of goods and services even beyond on our needs. With the rise of consumerism, people have become more materialistic, valuing possessions over personal qualities and experiences. This obsession with material objects has further contributed to environmental degradation, leading to more plastic waste and carbon emissions.\nTo conclude, advertising is a double-edged sword. While it may bring attention to new products and services and offer the opportunity to compare and choose between different options, it also has the potential to distort our perception of reality and influence us into making poor choices. As responsible consumers, we should learn to critically evaluate the messages conveyed by advertisements, not be manipulated by them.",

Government and non-governmental organisations have utilised advertisements to raise awareness on issues such as smoking, environmental conservation and road safety. In these instances, advertising can be a powerful tool for change and can influence behaviour in a positive way.\nIn conclusion, advertisements have become an integral part of modern society.

It seems as if there is no end to the lengths advertising companies will go to promote their products or services.\nDespite all this, it must be said that advertising is not entirely a bad thing. After all, it does provide valuable information about the latest products and services available, and informs the public of new trends in the market. Even so, the fact remains that advertising has become so pervasive and overpowering that it has an impact on just about every aspect of our lives.

These people are tired of suffering under bad leadership, and back the terrorists because theirs is a promise of change and improvement. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Jaffna, a north eastern province of Sri Lanka, have killed more than a dozen political and military leaders in the past three years. Ethnic riots in 1983 killed 2000 Tamils, and this pro found sense of Tamil grievance has helped the Tigers retain support. The Tamils feel discriminated against by the Sinhalese \u2013 dominated south, and feel that one of the solutions to ending such ethnic tension is to set up an autonomous state called Tamil Eelam for the Tamils.\nWe tend to view such acts of terror, ruthless murder and total disregard for human life as being revolting and sense less, but the number of pro-terrorist demonstrations in countries like Sri Lanka and in the West Bank and Gaza strip shows us that these terrorists actually enjoy support among their people.\nHowever, terrorist groups run the risk of losing their support. This could happen when the actions they take are seen as being too extreme, or when years of war and privation take their toll. The struggle in Ulster is increasingly viewed with a sense of disgust. Not only would the British government welcome the chance to bring its troops home from North ern Ireland, the majority of the people in Northern Ire land itself, be they Roman Catholic or Protestant, would simply like to get on with their lives. These people have endured 25 years of terrorism and bombings, and some have never known a normal life. Sights of armed soldiers patrolling the area have become common, and even a way of life.\nPublic support for the Irish Republican Army in the United States, mainly due to sympathy for the Irish, has diminished as well, largely due to growing revulsion at their killings. United States government officials say that contributions to the IRA have dwindled to a mere $200 000 a year, compared to millions a few years ago. This goes to show that the image of terrorists being noble \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d can slowly change as years go by, and little or no progress is achieved using strong-arm measures. The heavy cost of providing such groups with arms, and the massive toll on property and human life can cause people to think twice about supporting the terrorists. In Sri Lanka, many of Jaffna\u2019s remaining 600, 000 residents are weary of the war, but are afraid to speak out, aware of the Tiger habit of carrying out \u201clamppostings\u201d, street executions in which the bullet-riddled bodies of dissenters are left with signs labelling them traitors. In such cases, the \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d no longer have great support from the people, who now view them as being ruthless terrorists.\nA terrorist is not a terrorist in the eyes of the people he defends, at least, before his actions take a toll on public support. These people may be motivated by the desire for vengeance or strong religious beliefs to defend the actions of the terrorists as they believe they are fighting for a righteous cause. However, if we do not try to under stand the sentiments of such people, it is all too easy to dismiss terrorists as being frantic, deranged killers. Al though the world may disapprove of terrorists and the means which they use to achieve their aims, it remains a fact that such terrorists still exist today partly due to the support from the people, who feel that they are noble and brave, and who view them as martyrs, or \u201cfreedom fighters.\u201d",

The 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York was a heinous act of violence that resulted in the deaths of innocent people. However, the attack also brought global attention to the issue of terrorism, and the United States' role in the Middle East. Similarly, the bombing of the Brighton hotel by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1984, which aimed to assassinate British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, attracted international media attention to the situation in Northern Ireland.\n\nTerrorism can be distinguished from other forms of violence by the presence of certain characteristics. For an action to be labeled as terrorist, it must be politically motivated and have the intention of causing fear, panic, or terror among the general population. The target of the violence is often symbolic or iconic, such as government buildings, landmarks, or civilians that are representative of a particular group. The act must also be carried out by non-state actors operating outside the boundaries of the law.\n\nDespite the subjective nature of terrorism, the international community has formulated several definitions, with the United Nations being the most recognized. The United Nations describes terrorism as: \u201cany act that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act.\u201d This definition is inclusive and covers a broad range of activities that might be labeled as terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter\" highlights the complexity of politics and the subjective nature of terrorism. The use of violence for political purposes is often a response to systemic oppression or marginalization. Still, it can also be seen as immoral and unjustifiable. It is therefore essential to distinguish between those who use violence indiscriminately and those whose violence is in response to political injustice.

However, in the eyes of her supporters, Aung San Suu Kyi is a champion of democracy, fighting against the tyranny of the military rulers. Today, she is the State Counsellor of Myanmar, and continues to fight for the rights and freedoms of the people.\n\nIn conclusion, while acts of terrorism are generally condemned by the international community, it is important to understand the motivations behind these actions.

To the Chechen people, the fighters were heroes who were standing up to the invading forces and demanding their freedom. However, to the Russians, the same fighters were nothing but dangerous terrorists who were blowing up public places and killing innocent civilians. Eventually, a peaceful solution was found, and the Chechen people were granted the autonomy they were seeking. This is just one example that proves that sometimes, what may seem like terrorism to some, is actually a quest for freedom to others.\n\nIn conclusion, while the means used by terrorists to spread their message are not acceptable, it is important that we try to understand their cause rather than just dismissing them as criminals. Sometimes, their actions can be seen in a different light, and the fight for freedom and justice may push people to take radical steps. While we may not approve of the means, we cannot deny the fact that, for some, these fighters are heroes who are willing to risk everything for their beliefs.

The people of Rome, who lived in poverty, felt the same way. Thus, when Caesar was assassinated, a large number of Romans supported Brutus and his group, for they saw them as their saviors and liberators who were brave enough to stand up to the powerful ruler.\nHowever, one cannot ignore the fact that terrorism is still a heinous crime. The use of violence and intimidation to achieve their goals causes a sense of fear in the population, creating an atmosphere of unrest. Innocent people become victims and their lives are lost or they are left in a state of physical and emotional trauma. The true intentions of the terrorists are often buried under the violence and chaos they create, turning their aims from liberators to criminals. It is important to understand that violence can never be the solution, for it only creates more trouble and does not bring about any long-lasting change.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that one man\u2019s terrorist can be another man\u2019s freedom fighter, one must not forget the real reasons behind a group\u2019s actions. Although many of us may believe that we know the difference between right and wrong, it is important to remember that people who resort to terrorism are often those who believe that they have no other option. Therefore, it is up to us to ensure that the governments and leaders of the world are just, fair, and accountable for their actions, and that the systematic oppression of certain groups or classes of people does not give rise to terrorism.

Take the case of the Tamil Tigers, for example. They were formed in Sri Lanka in 1976, with the aim of creating an independent Tamil state in the northern and eastern regions of the country. The Tamils, who make up around 18% of the population, felt that they were being marginalized economically, politically and culturally by the ruling Sinhalese majority. The government's attempts to suppress the Tamil uprising only fueled the conflict, and the Tamil Tigers resorted to acts of terrorism such as assassinations of high-profile leaders, bombings of government buildings and bus stations, and even suicide attacks. The Tamil Tigers are seen by many Tamils as freedom fighters, who fought for their rights and for the creation of their own homeland. They enjoyed tremendous support from the Tamil diaspora living in countries such as India, Canada, UK and France. However, to the Sri Lankan government and the international community, they were seen as terrorists, who were responsible for the deaths of thousands of innocent people. The conflict eventually ended in 2009, with the defeat of the Tamil Tigers and the death of their leader Velupillai Prabhakaran.\nIn conclusion, the term \"terrorist\" is a loaded term, and its usage depends on the context in which it is used. While some terrorists may be seen as ruthless killers who are willing to take innocent lives to further their own political or ideological goals, to others they may be seen as fighters for their people's rights, who are willing to sacrifice their own lives for a cause they believe in. Ultimately, it is important to understand the root causes of terrorism and to address them in a peaceful and diplomatic manner, rather than resorting to violence and suppression.

While their methods and ideology may be viewed as extreme, the people of Afghanistan see the Taliban as the only hope for a better future, where they can lead their lives according to their own beliefs and values, without any interference or pressure from outside forces.\nIn conclusion, while terrorists may be seen as ruthless and inhumane by some, to others, they are seen as righteous freedom fighters who are willing to fight for their beliefs and values, even at the cost of their own lives. The perception of these terrorists varies from person to person, dependent on their own personal experiences, beliefs, and values.

It is a no-win situation. No matter what is done to help, the action may be seen as an added insult to either party and the possibility of conflict becomes even higher. In Singapore, this is clearly illustrated in the racial riots of the 1950s. Even today, the prejudice and conflicts are still present, though much more subtle. Malays are still stereotyped as lazy, the Chinese, as materialistic beyond redemption and the Indians are still generally looked down upon. I am not saying that the situation is explosive and ripe for conflict but I am just saying that the various prejudices are still present.\nEvidence of racial conflicts is rampant today. For many of these conflicts, their reasons stretch back many decades. For instance, the carnage in Rwanda started when the French colonialists long ago allowed one race, the Tutsis, to rule the other. When the French left, civil war broke out with one race, the Hutus, wanting to avenge the wrongs done to it by the ruling race during the years of French colonialism and to gain power and with the Tutsis trying to keep their power, even at the cost of sacrificing their own people to win sympathy and support. The hotspot in Bosnia can be traced all the way back to the beginning of this century when the breakup of the old Ottoman Empire left many smaller states hungry for more land and power. The \u201cforgotten war\u201d in the Nagorno Karabakh area can be traced to the former USSR\u2019s policy of resettling people away from their native homelands to alleviate its problems with the various nationalities.\nAs can be seen, the roots of these racial conflicts lie deep in history. It would take a long time and a lot of sustained effort to resolve these problems. Meanwhile, the seeds for future racial conflicts would be sown and these would erupt in the future.\nTo conclude, living in a world devoid of racial conflicts does seems to be an impossible dream. It is inherent in man\u2019s nature to want power over others and to be prejudiced against other races or jealous of their progress. This was obvious even at the very dawn of mankind when one tribe would routinely attack another for the simple reason that they were different and there was plunder to be had. The roots of such conflicts are also too deep and complicated to be resolved. It would take too much time and effort from too many parties, most of which would be reluctant to help unless it was to their direct advantage.

Similarly, the African-Americans feel that they are not getting equal treatment in the USA and this has led to various protests and demonstrations.\nDespite these difficulties, there exist people who believe that racial conflicts can be eliminated. These people believe that people should see themselves as humans first and members of a specific race second. They believe that everyone should be treated equally, irrespective of race. Such an attitude can be seen in the South African white people who are fighting against apartheid. These people know that they belong to the race which has been in power for a long time but they are willing to give up that power because they know that it is wrong to treat people differently just because of their race.\nThe elimination of racial conflict from the world is a long and difficult process, but it is possible. It can only be done through a greater understanding of ourselves and by learning to live in harmony with one another.

In addition, I acquired knowledge of the British political system by perusing Jeffrey Archer\u2019s \u201cFirst Among Equals\u201d and was s exposed to a stark prediction of what would happen to the world if a nuclear war occurred, in John Wyndham\u2019s \u201cChrysalids\u201d. Through a story set during the Revolutionary War, \u201cThe Island of the Blue Dolphins\u201d by Scott O\u2019Dell, I discovered how the American Indians lived their lives in the past.\nFourthly, reading is pleasurable as it helps me to be better able to relate to people. In reading, we are taught to understand the sufferings and problems other people have, which we may never have the opportunity to experience in our real life. For example, Wilfred Owen\u2019s war poems like \u201cDisabled\u201d and \u201cDulce et decorum est\u201d help us to realize the feelings of futility people feel towards the war and the psychological and physical damage done to soldiers in combat. Another example is \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d (John Steinbeck), a story set in the 1930s, in America, which revolves around a family from Oklahoma who migrated to California for employment. The story exposes us to poor-paying jobs, great poverty, the need to struggle and fight with others to survive and disdain shown by the rich, towards the poor.\nIn studying any book, we would feel for different characters differently, either sympathising, empathising or having antipathy towards them. This aids us in relating to the people around us as when we read more, our sympathy becomes more easily evoked and thus, in real life, we are also able to feel more easily for others. Extreme, evil characters also assist us in tolerating people who are unpleasant as one compares the latter with the former.   The fifth reason why reading is so pleasurable is be cause reading encourages imagination and creativity. One example is John Wyndham\u2019s \u201cChocky\u201d which urges us to imagine a world where aliens can enter one\u2019s minds to educate us. In this novel, Wyndham provides creative rea sons as to why aliens would want to occupy an earth ling\u2019s brain and refreshing alternatives to conventional ways of doing things.\nUndeniably, not all the books published would give us such pleasures in reading. Some novels have a weak plot, incredible characters and situations and worse of all, are written simply to pander to the baser instincts in mankind: sex and violence. This is notwithstanding the fact that such books do provide readers with some kind of satisfaction, though this is different from the kinds of satisfaction received from reading other kinds of literature. Yet, this kind of pleasure is one which we can do without as it does not benefit us in any other way except for a fleeting moment of delight.   To reiterate, reading does bring tremendous amounts of enjoyment, yet not all the enjoyment elicited from reading may be of the positive kind. The world of books offers endless hours of positive, pleasant and varied amusement to people who can read with ease. Let us strive to get the most out of our readings.",

A good book can push someone out of their comfort zone and help them grow as a person, similar to how a friend can help someone face their fears or overcome obstacles.\n\nHowever, some argue that books cannot replace human friendships. They believe that a good friend is someone who can offer emotional support, advice, and human connection. In contrast, a book is an inanimate object that cannot provide human interaction. A book is only a one-way conversation, and while it can offer hope and guidance, it cannot offer a hug or physical comfort. Additionally, friends can be someone to share experiences with, while in contrast, books are a solitary experience. Reading a book can be a solitary activity, and reading multiple books in succession might isolate one from the world if they withdraw too much from society.\n\nHowever, while these arguments have a point, they do not necessarily disprove the statement that a good book is like a good friend. Yes, a book may lack in human connection and interaction, but not everyone is seeking this aspect in a \"friend.\" Furthermore, people read for different reasons. Some read for comfort, support, guidance, or growth, and even though a book might not engage in a conversation nor be physically present, it can still fulfill these needs and provide a sense of kinship.\n\nIn conclusion, like a friend, a good book can offer companionship, therapeutic benefit, inspiration, and motivation. While a book may not replace a human connection, different people have different needs from a \"friend\", and a book can fulfill some of these relationships' aspects. A book can be a constant presence and a source of comfort in one's life. Therefore, I strongly agree that a good book is like a good friend, and we should cherish them as such.",

One can relax on a favourite couch, a drink and titbits by one\u2019s side while leisurely flipping through a book, rereading when one cannot understand the first time. This is not quite possible with a movie that is not on tape. Take our eyes off and, oh no, missed some thing crucial. Life is frantic enough, and books can help us relax. We do not need stress in our leisure too!\nMany books can be just as entertaining as films in their own way. An Omnimax movie may be breathtaking but the beauty of a perfect sunrise in a photography book. leaves a lasting and deeper impression. Jim Carey, Stephen Chow and other comedians may be funny but are often senseless or witless. Many good books give a good laugh with brilliantly witty lines. Also, there is no way anybody can make a film entitled \u201c1001 Greats Jokes\u201d!   We must also know that a book is rarely translated completely to a film. Just take the very successful \u201cFor est Gump\u201d, the film was excellent but deviated quite a bit from the book. Nowhere in the original book did Gump go running cross continent for three years. Often, it takes. the original book to give us a full understanding of the story. No actor can give us as clear a look into the thoughts of the character as the words of the author can.\nDue to the completeness of the original book, it can be more enthralling, more captivating than the film. Sometimes, the loud sounds and bright colours over whelm the scenes so much that all that is meaningful is lost. But a book is quiet; the only sound is our inner reading voice and imagined sounds running with the story. Reading can be an intimate thing between the reader and the story and its character. Characters from many good books I have read still feel so real to me even after reading them a long time ago. Few films can achieve this rapport.\nReading, in addition, cultivates us in ways no films can. It improves our language skills and appreciation of words. I would not be able to write half as well if not for my voracious reading, and many friends feel similarly. Films are loud, forceful and bright. Books can be all that yet gentle and refined. Books make us think too, and use our imaginations.   I love books and reading. They have done more good for me than all the films I have watched and I have watched quite a lot.

While films are easily accessible and offer instant entertainment, books offer a more substantial experience that can provide lifelong benefits. Books have the ability to expand our vocabulary and sharpen our language skills, as they expose readers to new language structures. Furthermore, books are a timeless medium that can create a sense of community and shared experience. For example, reading a classic like \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird\u201d can create a bond between readers of different generations as they discuss the novel\u2019s themes and how it reflects society.

The deeper meanings, importance of details and nuances of written words, the mental effort required to understand a book, and the lifelong benefits it offers all outweigh the passive nature of watching a film. The experience of reading a book can never be replaced by a film, and it is important to recognize the unique benefits that each medium offers.

Films, on the other hand, often have to simplify and condense the story and themes for the sake of time and audience attention span.\nIn conclusion, while films may have certain advantages over books such as affordability, entertainment value and social enjoyment, books still have their place as a valuable and versatile medium for learning, self-reflection and creative expression.

In addition, one can easily go back to a certain chapter or page of a book, re-read and reflect on it. This is even more difficult to do with films, as searching for a certain scene can be time-consuming and tedious.\nBooks also offer a more challenging mental simulation as compared to films. They require effort to read, understanding and interpreting, and can help in improving one\u2019s vocabulary and language proficiency - skills that are essential in both academic and working environments. Reading also allows one to enter the mind of the writer and understand his or her thoughts and perspectives. This is an intimate and unique experience that cannot be replicated in film.\nIn conclusion, while films may seem to have many advantages over books, the latter still holds an important place in society today. Books offer benefits such as portability, accessibility without technological dependence, mental stimulation and personal interpretation which cannot be fully replicated in a visual medium like films. We should not discount the power of books and continue to encourage reading as an essential part of education and lifelong learning.",
                "r someone. This cannot be said for films where one must sit down and devote a considerable amount of time to watch it. Books also provide a better avenue for improving one's language and writing skills. While watching a film, one simply sits back and absorbs what is happening on screen. But when reading a book, one has to constantly engage the mind, interpret and analyse the language, and visualise characters and settings. This active mental process can greatly enhance a person's language and overall cognitive abilities.\nBesides that, books can offer a deeper and more intimate understanding of the story and characters as compared to films. It allows readers to explore the characters' inner thoughts and emotions, giving them a more nuanced and complex personality. In contrast, films may not be able to properly capture the nuances of a character or storyline, due to the limited time they have to convey the plot. This is particularly true for adaptations where certain elements of the book may be left out or changed entirely.\nIn conclusion, while films may have their advantages over books, such as affordability, accessibility and entertainment value, reading still holds a vital place in our world. Books may be more traditional and old-fashioned, but they provide convenience and intellectual benefits that cannot be found in films. Ultimately, whether one prefers books or films is a matter of personal preference and should be respected.",

With books, it is a one-to-one relationship between reader and writer, no one else is involved. This is different from watching a film which is a shared experience with others, and where others influence how one should or could feel about the film. Reading a book also requires a different sort of concentration and a more imaginative type of engagement. Reading requires active participation on the part of the reader as he or she imagines places, characters, and situations. These aspects ensure books provide a different and unique type of entertainment.\nIn conclusion, both books and films have their own strengths and offer different forms of entertainment. While films have the advantage of convenience, cost and easy entertainment, books offer a more personal and imaginative experience. They may not appeal as massively or conveniently as films, but that is part of their charm. The choice of what to read or watch depends on what one is looking for and the particular circumstances of the individual. So, the answer to whether books should be replaced by films is: it depends!",

Readers use their imagination, creativity and critical thinking skills to visualise scenes and make sense of the written word. This results in mental development and stimulation which is not as present when simply watching a screen.\nFurthermore, books offer a wider range of content that may not necessarily be translated into film format. For example, some novels delve into complex philosophical or psychological topics that cannot be adequately expressed through visuals or dialogue alone. Reading provides a depth of understanding and knowledge that films may not always be able to provide.\nIn conclusion, while films offer many advantages over books in terms of accessibility, entertainment and social interaction, the benefits of reading should not be neglected. Reading develops the mind, and provides a unique and valuable experience that films cannot always replicate.

This is a luxury many could not afford with their busy schedules. Moreover, reading stimulates the imagination. Our mind paints the images and characters in the book unlike films where everything is presented on a platter. This imagination creates a deeper connection and attachment to the narrative. Reading also improves vocabulary, comprehension and concentration which are important academic skills.\nIn conclusion, while films have their advantages over books in terms of accessibility, entertainment and social activities, books still have their relevance in our modern world. The affordability, portability and cognitive benefits of reading cannot be discounted.

The reader is left to interpret and imagine the story in their own unique way, allowing for a more diverse and personalized experience.\nIn conclusion, while films do seem to have an upper hand in terms of accessibility and entertainment value, books still hold significant value in terms of convenience, personalization and intellectual development. It is important to strike a balance between the two forms of media to reap the benefits of both.

The tone and mood of the book is for the reader to imagine and interpret. Each reader can therefore appreciate the story in their own personal way. This is a wonderful advantage over films, which is limited by cinematic technology and movie industry bureaucracy.\nIn conclusion, both books and films have their own distinct advantages and disadvantages.

Books can also be passed down through generations, becoming a family heirloom or a treasured possession. The nostalgia of holding a well-loved book, with creased pages and notes in the margins, cannot be replicated by a digital file or a DVD.\n\nIn conclusion, books and films are both valuable forms of entertainment, but they offer different experiences and benefits.

In contrast, films can lose their appeal after a few years as they are often dependent on the special effects and technological advancements of their time. Furthermore, the sheer volume of books available in the world means that there will always be something new to discover or rediscover.\n\nIn conclusion, while films may have taken over as the preferred form of entertainment for many, books still remain an invaluable and unique form of media.

My parents took me for physiotheraphy but it did not make it completely normal, though it did improve. People used to make fun of the way I walked, saying I walked like a duck-and some of them still do. I used to write in my diary, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why God has to do this to me\u201d and tearfully pity myself. Then one day when I was sixteen, I started reading my old diary and some thing came to my mind whenever I read those episodes. l realised that there are many people without legs and hands, and all I have is a little crooked leg which functions perfectly. Why was I so ungrateful? From that day, I stopped blaming God and started to take the initiative to walk straight. My mother says I have improved tremendously \u2013 and thanks again to my diary.\nI am confessing a great sin I did once, I read my mother\u2019s diary two years ago\u2026 and believe me, I still feel so guilty about it though nobody knows. But that diary made me love her more than anything else in the whole, wide universe. My father passed away around three years ago and she kept a diary as her means of communication with him. I truly did not know she loved him so much and she was going through such deep sorrow though she put on such a brave face outside \u2013 for us she said. She felt that her only reasons for living now were for me and my sisters and nothing in the world would make her leave us, because of him. From just those few pages that I read, I learned how great a mother\u2019s love is and how much greater it is for her husband. My mother was surprised at the change she saw in me after that I have been a wonderful daughter to her since, though she does not really know why. And when I get married, I want to be like her\u2026 and I owe it to a personal diary book, not mine in this case!   People have often wondered how I can stick to writing in my diary booklet because they say that they can only keep it up for a few days.\nI\u2019ve had small diaries and big ones, plain and coloured ones, thick and thin ones, which have just been like my life. My diaries have always been my best friends, my most personal confidants. They have in deed gone through the best and worst times of my life with me.

Similarly, writing down one's thoughts, particularly negative ones, is a much healthier way of coping with stress than keeping them inside. This is because the act of writing helps to put one's thoughts in order and provides a sense of distance between the writer and their emotions, making emotions more manageable. As a result, writing about negative events and emotions may aid in stress management and emotional regulation.\n\nAnother benefit of diary keeping is that it can cultivate creativity. People who keep diaries may find that the daily or weekly task of writing encourages them to explore their imagination. By experimenting with different writing styles and using descriptive language, they can improve their writing skills. In addition, writing prompts, such as writing about a personal experience in a different style, can help build creativity.\n\nFinally, keeping a diary aids in goal setting and accomplishment. By recording goals and action plans, diary keepers can track their progress. This can be incredibly beneficial when trying to achieve long-term goals, such as weight loss or academic achievement. Diary keepers can also identify areas that require improvement and modify their actions in order to achieve their goals.

Recently, wealthy youths and young adults in China were flaunting their wealth online and the Chinese were quick to recognize that this had a negative influence on the general public as such activities promote arrogance and wastage. The authorities took swift action and banned numerous social media accounts that they deemed detrimental to Chinese culture. Clearly, the belief that modern technology offers complete freedom is an illusion. Governments maintain full control. Hence, it is clear that modern technology, in reality, has limited impact and does not easily threaten the existing system of governance (be it democracy or others).\nDetractors may argue that some people may make use of the Internet to magnify the flaws of democracy and hence, cause others to lose confidence in democracy. For instance, extremists may take to the Internet to radicalize young and gullible citizens and encourage them to perform acts of terrorism. In this case, one may argue that modern technology threatens democracy because it gives rise to unruly and violent behaviour. In 2015, two adults who radicalized themselves via social media were arrested and detained in Singapore under the Internal Security Act (ISA). The ISA gives the government the power to detain individuals without trial. Although controversial, the ISA has been enforced and proven somewhat effective in weeding out potential threats that arise from the use of modern technology. Hence, confidence levels in democracy remain largely unaffected due to the presence of similar laws.\nDetractors may also use the Internet to point out egregious imperfections directly to dampen confidence in democracy. For instance, one may go online to point out that too much freedom of speech can lead to an unstable political climate. Without stability, a country is less likely to be able to continue attracting foreign investments and hence, livelihoods are at stake. By stoking fear, one may become successful in destabilizing a country. Protests could be rife in public streets. Public confidence in the elected government would plunge to an all-time low and hence, threaten democracy.\nAdmittedly, these concerns are understandable and even legitimate. However, one must not forget that although these are austere concerns, governments are taking an active interest in them. As mentioned, having no regulations at present does not mean that regulations will not come into effect in the near future. With time, governments are realizing that policies and laws need to be updated to deal with problematic concerns. In China, in the name of national security, all foreign social media platforms are banned and citizens are only allowed access to local social media platforms, which are closely monitored and highly regulated by the Chinese government. In New Zealand, the country has recently announced that it will start to regulate social media content to deal with misinformation. Again, this clearly shows that modern technology has little or no impact on a country's system of governance as it can be controlled and regulated if a government chooses to.\nIn conclusion, the rise of modern technology has given everyone additional channels to voice their opinions. In other words, we have more choices than ever. I firmly believe that technology has given democracy a boost. At times, technology may appear to threaten democracy. However, these threats can easily be curbed by incumbent governments and therefore, modern technology poses little threat to democracy.",

Additionally, efforts to manipulate processes such as elections, also known as cyber-voting, are becoming increasingly commonplace. Technology provides the means to subvert voting systems through assaults such as hacking and creating bot interference, which can render the entire electoral process vulnerable to manipulation. This erodes the free and fair outcome of elections and undermines the legitimacy of democratic processes.\n\nIt is evident that technology presents both opportunities and challenges to the democratic process. For democracy to be strengthened by advancements in technology, it is crucial that all stakeholders such as governments, industry, and civil society, are committed to ensuring that technology is harnessed for positive outcomes. Government leadership and appropriate regulation are crucial. Governments can support transparency by making official information easily accessible and enact laws that promote fair and responsible use of technology, such as regulating social media platforms to reduce the spread of fake news. Industry players should commit to ethical practices and proactively implement mechanisms for user protection and data privacy. Finally, civil society actors, including media and watchdog groups, have to monitor and broadcast reports exposing any inappropriate use of such technology.\n\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that technology is a double-edged sword when it comes to democracy.

This means political decisions might be taken based on information that is not only incorrect, but also detrimental to the interests of the public. Besides, the internet and social media platforms can also be used as tools by foreign powers to sway political opinions in one direction or the other, thus threatening the autonomy of a country. Nonetheless, the state is still actively working towards improving cyber-security and has put in place laws to deter individuals from spreading false information. The government also encourages citizens to be critical thinkers and to not take every piece of information received online at face value.\n\nIn conclusion, while modern technology does pose certain threats to democracy, its benefits outweigh the disadvantages. It is an indispensable tool that allows for the free sharing of ideas, encourages citizen participation and amplifies citizens' voices, which in turn strengthens democracy.

This means that regular people are more informed about political issues and can form sound decisions based on their knowledge. Furthermore, modern technology has democratized access to information. In the past, only a select group of people had access to information that was pertinent to public life, but now, anyone with an Internet connection has access to a sea of information. This creates a level playing field for all citizens and empowers them to participate in the decisions of their country.\nIn conclusion, the impact that modern technology has on democracy is both positive and negative. While it can help to magnify the benefits of democracy, it can also magnify its flaws.

Young activists such as Greta Thunberg are also becoming more and more outspoken and have taken to the media to voice their opinions courageously.\nI am also of the view that more can be done to speed up the progress of climate change. Firstly, countries will need to commit to active monitoring to track their progress. A quick visit to government websites reveals that many countries such as Hong Kong, Switzerland, New Zealand have taken steps to educate their citizens about environmental concerns. They have also set aside funds that either encourage companies to go green or take up green projects that are beneficial to the environment in the long run. A clear standard will need to be set and observed by all countries to minimize false or inaccurate reporting of carbon emissions. Instead of waiting for governments to put regulations in place, private companies should act swiftly to conduct studies that help improve efficiency and reduce wastage. Finally, governments should work towards creating new jobs so as to minimize job losses and disruptions.\nIn conclusion, the message to everyone has never been clearer. We cannot achieve lofty climate change goals alone. We need to take ownership of the problems that we have created, perhaps due to excessive consumption, and assume full responsibility. While I observe that that has not happened presently, I refuse to accept that all our attempts to revert global warming are destined to fail. As shown by the success of the Montreal Protocol, it is clearly possible that as a race, we are perfectly capable of directing our futures and changing our fortunes. While some tacky challenges remained, I adopt the sanguine view that in time, some of our attempts will succeed. A successful attempt can inspire future generations and pave the way for future successes. My only hope is that success comes soon enough before we cross the line of no return and it is too late.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "e long-term commitment and vision.\n\nMoreover, international agreements that have been developed to mitigate climate change continue to face numerous challenges. For instance, the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 was a significant achievement in the global fight against climate change. However,  although 191 countries agreed to the accord, it remains to be seen whether they will find it feasible to fulfill their pledges. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many economies, and most countries are prioritizing economic recovery over climate initiatives. Moreover, the political will to implement the accord varies significantly between countries with diverse political climates.\n\nHowever, there are also counterarguments to the view that all attempts to mitigate climate change are inherently ineffective. First, significant progress has been made in developing renewable energy technologies. Solar and wind energy are becoming increasingly popular due to falling prices and advancements in technology. Similarly, electric cars are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. These developments suggest that alternatives to existing technologies may well emerge in the future, paving the way for greater emissions reductions.\n\nSecond, the shift to low-carbon energy alternatives is also being driven by market forces. Coal-fired power plants have been closing at a rapid rate as renewable energy sources become cheaper. Large corporations are also investing in renewable energy, driven by both moral and economic considerations. In the past, energy-intensive industries like aviation, shipping, and steel production have been slow to adopt eco-friendly technologies. Still, there are now signs that they are beginning to explore alternatives actively.\n\nFinally, public awareness and action on climate change are increasingly gaining momentum, with thousands of movements and citizen groups emerging globally. This collective activism could lead governments and corporations to take more significant measures to reduce emissions, encourage a transition to a low carbon economy, and enact policies to achieve net-zero emissions in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, the view that attempts to control climate change are entirely ineffective is not entirely accurate. While existing mitigation strategies face several challenges and limitations, there are signs that opportunities to combat climate change continue to emerge. Technological advancements, market forces, and ongoing activism by groups worldwide suggest that the fight against climate change can still be won. However, concerted collaboration between nations worldwide, with a shared focus on a sustainable future, remains key to this effort's success.",

In addition, financial incentives were also provided to countries who adhered to the protocol and enforced it strictly. This highlights the importance of collective responsibility and the role of education in solving environmental problems.\nIn conclusion, while it may seem that controlling climate change is an insurmountable task, I still believe that there are steps that can be taken to mitigate its effects. The success of the Montreal Protocol shows the effectiveness of educating the public and providing financial incentives to encourage countries to enforce protocol. It is my hope that governments, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector will collaborate and work towards a sustainable future for our planet.",

Countries must be willing to put aside their personal interests and work towards a common goal of saving our planet. Governments can provide incentives for industries to adopt greener practices, and individuals can take small steps such as reducing single-use plastic and conserving energy in their own homes. Every action we take counts towards a more sustainable future.",

Industries were able to transition relatively smoothly from CFCs to HFCs, thus minimizing any economic impact. In contrast, the Kyoto Protocol requires a fundamental change in global energy consumption and production, which is much more difficult to achieve.\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that controlling climate change is not an easy task. Regional treaties such as Kyoto Protocol and Paris Climate Agreement may not be effective in controlling climate change because of the challenges and inherent issues of such treaties. However, global endeavors to tackle environmental issues, such as the successful Montreal Protocol, gives us hope for the future.

Many countries are still dependent on fossil fuels to power their economies, and the shift towards cleaner energy sources will require much effort and time.\nIn conclusion, climate change is a pressing issue that requires the collective effort of all nations. Regional treaties have been established to address this problem, but they have fallen short of expectations due to inherent challenges such as lack of incentives and political will, as well as industries' reluctance to change. Despite the setbacks, hope still exists in the form of the Paris Climate Agreement. As citizens of this planet, we must continue to be aware of the threats of climate change and do our part to advocate for change, even if it means making small sacrifices in our daily lives.",

Industries were required to phase out the use of CFCs and viable alternatives were provided. This allowed the industry to adapt and adjust, rather than be eliminated. The key takeaway here is that it is crucial to identify and highlight key issues that require attention in order to achieve success in climate change control.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change is a pressing issue that requires immediate attention. Regional treaties have their own set of challenges and are largely ineffective. However, this does not mean that all hope is lost. Through the identification of key issues and tangible solutions, progress towards a greener future can be achieved. Governments and industries need to work together, as changes in the economic landscape can only occur with a united front. It is important to remain optimistic and continue searching for ways to better protect our planet.",

However, it is important for us to remain hopeful and continue fighting for what we believe in. While regional treaties may have their flaws, it is necessary for countries to come together and work towards a common goal. Ultimately, the success of any treaty will depend on individual countries' commitment to the cause. As individuals, we should also play our part by making sustainable choices in our daily lives. Together, we can make a difference in preserving our environment for future generations.",
                "answer lies in the difference in the incentives and penalties provided. The Montreal Protocol provided a clear timeline for phasing out CFCs along with penalties for non-compliance. The incentives came in the form of the shared technology for finding CFC alternatives. The private sector played a crucial role too, with many companies engineering new CFC-free products. The result of all these was that economic growth was sustained and no major disruptions were observed. Hence, I believe the key to successful climate control is to provide strong incentives for governments and industries to adhere to the protocols.\n\nIn conclusion, regional treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Climate Agreement have been deemed as ineffective. However, the success of the Montreal Protocol has shown us that controlling climate change can be effective if the right incentives and penalties are set. While it is a complex issue, the world can take strides towards a better future by setting achievable and enforceable targets backed up by scientific research. Everyone can make a difference by making small changes such as consuming less meat, driving less or even planting more trees. Ultimately, it is the collective effort that will determine if we leave our planet in a better place than we inherited.",
                "difference lies in incentives and policy implementation.\nUnder the Montreal Protocol, the costs of implementing CFC alternatives were lower and it is easier for manufacturers to integrate the alternatives into existing products. The industry was given enough time to adjust and put in place measures to replace CFC products. Additionally, better policies that provided a strong regulatory framework spearheaded the campaign. Governments also provided funds for research and development of alternatives.\nSimilarly, I believe that providing incentives and benefits to nations will be an effective way to ensure that they are on board and committed to tackling climate change. One such incentive could be green bonds. Green bonds can be used to fund projects that combat climate change such as financing green infrastructure projects for the public. If more green bonds are issues, it is likely that more investors will want to buy them. This creates a demand for green projects which may spur companies to take the initiative to undertake such projects.\nIn conclusion, while previous attempts at combatting climate change have been largely ineffective, I believe that there are ways we can make these treaties more effective. It is vital that incentives are put in place to encourage nations to change their ways and invest in climate-friendly technology. We must also believe that collectively we can make a difference and that it is not too late to reverse the course of our future.",
                "main reason is that the Montreal Protocol did not give an option for the use of a substitute chemical that was harmful to the environment. This meant that industries could not argue for the importance of their existence as the byproduct of their industry was simply unacceptable. In comparison, the Kyoto Protocol allowed participants to purchase carbon credits from other countries to offset their own carbon output. This creates a loophole where it may be more cost-efficient for countries to do nothing to decrease carbon emissions.\n\nIn conclusion, climate change is one of the greatest challenges that humanity faces. While regional treaties like the Paris Climate Agreement are necessary to combat the issue, there are still challenges that need to be overcome. The use of economic persuasion such as taxes and subsidies should be initiated to incentivize the companies and the public to take action. A bottom up approach where the public takes an active role, and the industries follow the trends, would also be crucial in tackling the problems head-on. Climate change is here, and creative solutions will need to be sought and implemented to change the future trajectory of our planet.",

There was a strong sense of collaboration and collective responsibility, and this is what made the Montreal Protocol a success.\n\nIn the context of climate change, it is important for all nations to have a common understanding that a sustainable future can only be achieved through collective global effort. While there may be differences in the level of development and economic priorities, it is vital for all nations to work together in achieving a common goal of reducing carbon emissions and promoting sustainable practices. It is also important for nations to recognize the role they play in addressing climate change and take appropriate actions, beyond what is required by regional treaties.\n\nIn conclusion, while regional treaties have their limitations in addressing climate change effectively, it is important for nations to work together towards achieving sustainable development.

Talent is meaningless without having opportunities for such talents to develop and blossom. Nations as well as private institutions that recognize sports talents do provide the resources and infrastructure to ensure a country's dominance in certain sports. A salient example would be China selecting young children to join Wu Shu training from a very young age. Young children are selected based on their physical attributes and their potential to do well in the sport. Once chosen, the children go through intensive and vigorous training to become world class athletes. Jet Li, an international celebrity, was a beneficiary of this system. He won over a dozen gold medals in Wu Shu before retiring and becoming an action star. Similarly, in many European nations such as Brazil, Spain, Mexico and Argentina, young talented players go for auditions at local youth clubs. Those who are selected are offered contracts. If they do well, they will be offered more lucrative contracts and go on to become professional players. Having these systems in place ensure that talented players get a chance to join and excel in sports, which is beneficial to both individuals and nations.\nIt does sometimes appear that governments only play a minor role in sporting success but I disagree. In many developed nations, specialized sports institutions are set up to nurture the talents of those who are gifted in sports. In Singapore, the Singapore Sports School is well equipped with cutting edge knowledge and equipment to aid and support aspiring sports individuals to pursue their interests. The advantages that the Sports School offers are apparent and lead to tangible results. In fact, it has become a point of contention. Some parents wonder if it is rational to include the Sports School in national sports competitions since they have the tendency to win by large margins in almost all sports! Although contentious, the presence of the Singapore Sports School provides irrefutable evidence that governments play some part in sporting success. Governments are also known to offer attractive monetary incentives to athletes who win medals and enhance national pride.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that we should not define 'nation' so narrowly as to only include the governments. A nation consists of all its people in its entirety \u2013 its leaders, the public and private institutions, as well as private citizens.

The individual contributes by giving his or her full dedication and even go as far as to deplete personal savings. Private institutions can help to develop young talents by setting up youth clubs and providing coaching expertise since they have a vested interest in keeping the sports industry healthy. Governments can assist by investing in infrastructure (e.g. building stadiums) and provide financial support or incentives to encourage better performances. For these reasons, I am hesitant to conclude that individuals achieve sporting success and not nations. Both nations and individuals play considerable roles that contribute to sporting successes. Both should work closely together to achieve the best results. Individuals should show their full commitment and nations should back individuals with adequate resources and infrastructure.

            "prompt": "'Countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out its own problems.' How far do you agree?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "ing advancement and improvement to perceived forgotten lands, can be found littered in the annals of history, thwarted by the savage, ungrateful creates unable to comprehend the gifts of modernity. From the futile attempts to educate women on menstrual hygiene, or merely seeking to eradicate the abhorrent practice of Chhaupadi \u2013 banishing women to secluded huts during their menstrual cycle \u2013 our efforts to solve problems and eliminate conflict are clearly thwarted by our lack of true understanding. Whether conflict stems from gender, cultural practices, race, religion, or whichever arbitrary division prevalent, intervention on the basis of wisdom, knowledge, or wealth, does little to resolve conflict, even if it might numb the extent somewhat.\nWhat perhaps is the straw that breaks the camel's back is the pride involved in conflict resolution. This is particularly troubling since one country's problem can be construed as injurious to the image of the nation. To then have another nation coming to the rescue is likely to be far more than any self-respecting citizen can bear. After all, nationalistic pride would prevent one from accepting the superiority of another nation and its ways, especially at the implied rejection of one's own, or at least the acknowledgement of its inadequacies. From Castro's rebellious declaration that Cuba does not need \"gifts from the Empire\", to North Korea's persistent efforts to credit the Supreme Leader for the items sent by America, the insecurity and threat to sovereignty is plainly evident. Even in the face of rational reason, the acceptance of assistance from other nations is an admission of weakness and ineptitude. Moreover, this is assuming that the help was not already mired in a Gordian knot of terms and conditions, intended to impose the values and will of the party offering help. The European Union's offer to bail out bankrupt nations often included a requirement for austerity measures, at once a clear show of dominance and also a less than covert criticism on existing leadership. Such efforts, rationally sensible, provoke resentment and retaliation, further fracturing the communities already having difficulties.\nWith such clear limitations to intervention, it is logical for nations to be given the space to work through their issues. They have the clearest insight and knowledge; and whether they admit and acknowledge it is another matter.  The solutions, however juvenile or imperfect the rest of the world deems, is theirs and they can focus on tweaking it instead of being compelled to fervently defend it out of pride. Perhaps most poignant is the revelation that problems and conflicts are largely products of perception. The value-judgement and priorities already vary enough from individual to individual, without foreign input to complicate matters far more.\nNow, it is not to say that foreign intervention has no place, but that the conditions must be thus urgent and severe enough to necessitate the actions, considering the implications and general futility. Thankfully, our pride does allow for the acceptance of help and intervention, at least when it is apparent that the refusal of which mean certain death and suffering in the immediate future. Typically triggered by natural catastrophes, the urgency and severity facilitate the expression and acceptance of humanity, without fear of the cynical self-interest that attaches itself to rational thought and plans. Wherever the catastrophe, the world rallies quickly, driven by the stark reminder of our own mortality, to help a fellow human being. We are cognisant that without assistance, irrevocable consequences are swift and cruel, spurring us to act as a collective bastion of humanity. Yet, in less urgent situations, we find ways to rationalise our way out of helping or accepting such help, however severe it may be.In all, it is clear that countries experiencing conflict should generally be left to sort out its own problems, with its expertise and the futility of intervention, though it must be acknowledged that we should make an exception in cases of extreme urgency and severity. Whether the decision to not intervene is borne of acknowledgement of futility or trust in the community, this approach will at least reduce complications and divergence that lend itself to further disagreements. It takes a lot of faith to allow events to unfold themselves, the effort to resist intervention far greater than simply taking over. Let us not make the mistake of equating non-intervention with disinterest, but instead, choose to see it as the greatest expression of faith and confidence in the fellow humans in other nations. As much as we lambast Nigeria and their president, we should remember that the people had the wisdom to not re-elect President Goodluck. That should count for something.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "eign powers supported different factions and poured in arms and resources, leading to a complex and multi-layered conflict. The conflict in Syria illustrates that foreign intervention can complicate the situation, prolong the conflict, and contribute to the suffering of innocent people.\n\nAnother example of a negative intervention stems from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, an event that was based on false intelligence and led to a prolonged and destructive conflict that destabilized the region and cost thousands of lives. Critics argue that the invasion was a misguided attempt to impose Western values on Iraq, rather than allowing the nation to determine its own destiny.\n\nFurthermore, foreign intervention could lead to issues relating to sovereignty, and independence. For example, in 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Slobodan Milosevic, the former President of Serbia and Kosovo, for war crimes. The ICTY defeated the Serbian government's claims that the case was illegitimate since the ICTY was established by the United Nations Security Council\u2019s resolution. The situation in Serbia illustrates that foreign intervention may be perceived negatively by a country's citizens and governments.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of whether countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out their own problems is a complex one. Any decision to intervene or not should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature, extent, and causes of the conflict. Sometimes, external intervention is necessary when a conflict poses a global threat or gross human rights abuses. Conversely, sometimes intervention can cause more harm than good and lead to prolonged conflict. Ultimately, the decision to intervene should prioritize human safety and ensure that it aligns with the wishes of the affected nation.",
            "human_gen_text": [
                "ing our solution to another's problems, rather than understanding the context of the situation, would only make the situation much worse. The conflict in Syria, as grave as it is, is wholly different from the power struggle in Venezuela, or the ethnic tensions in Myanmar. The belief that a one-size-fits-all solution can work, is an illusion. The complexities of such conflicts, the nuances that require deep understanding and familiarity, are the very aspects foreign powers often disregard in their interventions. They may have the notion of what the problem is, but without understanding the problem can lead to unintended and catastrophic consequences.\nIn conclusion, while there is no question that the world's issues are varied and seemingly insurmountable, we must proceed with caution in determining what solution to implement in successfully resolving conflicts. The intervention in conflicts is riddled with vested interests and the belief that by bringing in the external help, the solution to the problem can be found. However, such help should not be at the cost of the context of the issue, which is unique to the country it is occurring in. In most cases, it is wiser to allow for self-sustaining recovery that is internal in nature, with external engagement limited to capacity building that is sustainable and creates an infrastructure for future stability. While this may take a more extended period, it allows the necessary focus on the community's particular needs, thus providing a lasting solution that carries the voice of the affected population.",
                "ing our solutions to others, is exposed and magnified by the tragedy of our hubris, as the meddling in Iran manner that Iran has complained about for decades. Even when the interventions have the best of intentions, as evident in the case of Ebonyi State in Nigeria, where terrible schooling was improved under the Safe School Initiative, and up to the point bomb blasts disrupted it became one of the alternative schools for out-of-school children who would have been possible targets of the insurgents' attacks. Regardless of good intentions, though, the fact remains that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. It may be hard to swallow, but we tend to make a mess of things when we intervene in domestic issues of countries that are not our own.\nTo conclude, we must recognise that the issues that ignited internal conflict will be unique to the country, and the intervention or aid must be limited to the extent that it can actually be helpful and not dig the hole deeper. As much as we may think that our aid is the best solution, it is a product of the context of our lives, which may not be the same as theirs. Furthermore, the cost of aid is often going to be greater than any benefit gained. Hence, I propose a policy of non-intervention, where we leave countries to sort out their problems. While it may seem heartless, we must understand that they are often better suited to solve their own problems from the nuances of the issues. Ultimately, we must avoid the trap of moral superiority, which tends to dictate that what we think is best for others, is in the actual sense, something they can do without.",
                "ing change and resolution in a foreign nation, may very well blind us to its complexities and nuances. This is made worse by the fact that foreign intervention often erodes the sovereignty of the nation, taking away the power of self-governance, and forcing them to abide by external rules and regulations. Such external interference also spawns dependency syndrome where the nation becomes reliant on foreign aid since it is easier to accept than to undergo the rigorous process of self-development and growth.\n\nAll things considered, it is my view that foreign intervention in a country's affairs should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. As outsiders, it is easy to assume that we possess superior knowledge and skills to manage these conflicts, but the reality is that local solutions are often more effective and have the advantage of being more sustainable. Furthermore, we must be cautious of administering 'aid' as such assistance is rarely altruistic and often comes with attached strings that negatively impact the recipient's sovereignty. Instead, we must support nations through capacity-building initiatives that allow them to develop resilience and address the underlying causes of conflict. It is only through this approach that we can foster true independence and growth and ensure that nations are equipped to address their own internal issues.",
                "ing our solutions to other nations, only succeeds in highlighting our shared Western-centered worldview, stripping nations of the agency to solve their own problems. Thus, foreign intervention, while well-intended, often falls short in the long run, further exacerbating the problem due to a lack of context, ground-level understanding and acknowledgment of the local history, traditions and mindsets unique to the affected area.\nIn conclusion, while it is imperative to address a nation's problems, there is an inherent arrogance that comes with simply imposing our own solutions on another country's troubles. We should advocate for more assistance at the initial stages of conflict and seek to empower local communities. Instead of playing saviour, we should seek to work alongside people in the afflicted nation, building trust and understanding before offering solutions.Eventually recognizing and amplifying the voices of the people affected is key to a successful resolution of the conflict at hand, without compromising the integrity of that nation's decision-making. In essence, empowering people rather than simply acting on our desire to intervene is what will lead to a sustainable solution; one unique to its own specific context, free from external influences and interests.",
                "ing our supposed superior knowledge and values, is liable to overlook nuances, even when attempting to be helpful, leading to further complications and potentially adding to the problem.\nIn conclusion, while the desire to help countries facing conflicts is admirable, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of intervention. The lack of resources or ability does not necessarily justify it since there may be vested interests involved. Moreover, as outsiders, we cannot possibly understand the unique context and mindset of the afflicted society, resulting in potentially complicating rather than mitigating the situation. Therefore, while we should continue to offer assistance in whatever form we can, we must also respect the sovereignty and autonomy of other nations, allowing them to handle their problems in their own way. Only then can we attempt to genuinely help reduce the conflicts and unrest in the world.",
                "ing salvation to another, blinds us to the intrinsic complications of the issue. Only by understanding the root causes and delving into the complex web of factors at play, can we hope to solve the problem at the heart of the conflict.\nMoreover, the excessive dependence on external assistance has a detrimental impact on the domestic effort to sort out the root causes of the conflict. This dependency dulls the senses and makes the task of conflict resolution less urgent, as it is easy for countries to be content and assume the responsibility of conflict management will be taken up by external powers. This, in fact, leads to greater resistance to any so-called foreign intervention. After all, countries are invested in their sovereignty and the management of a conflict must be an internal affair, no matter how grave the conflict. There is a certain drive and urgency that comes with self-determination, an urgency that is sorely lacking when a country chooses to delegate the task to external powers.\nIn conclusion, while on the surface intervention might seem a logical solution, we must also consider the vested interests and complications that come with such aided measures. Perhaps, a better solution would be to get to the root of the conflict and work towards an internal resolution, with external aid serving only as a supplement to an already existing and motivated effort. Only then can we hope to truly solve the conflict, and leave behind a lasting legacy of peace and prosperity.",
                "ing the supposed solution, does not allow us to consider the unique context of the issues present, which are often entrenched in deep-seated cultural, religious, or political beliefs.\nIn conclusion, while it may seem like the right thing to do, intervening in a country's internal conflict often leads to unintended consequences and further destabilisation. The problems ailing the country might stem from deep cultural, political, or economic beliefs that external intervention cannot easily solve. Ultimately, the resolution of conflict must come from within, and while the international community can offer assistance, the decision must ultimately be left to the people of that country.",
                "ing order and stability, rather than leaving room for the nuanced socio-political context of the community, often does more harm than good. This is the case repeatedly in Africa, where despite the billions of dollars in aid and the people sent from other nations to help, has done little to mitigate the spreading poverty and conflict. In fact, more often than not, intervention in domestic issues has led to resentment and distrust towards the intervening party, with the locals regarding them as inept and lacking in fundamental knowledge required to change the situation for the better.\nIn conclusion, it is vital that we weigh in the implications of intervention, or lack thereof, and identify the possible motives and vested interests of the intervening parties. Regardless of how noble the intentions may be, stepping into domestic issues of other nations and communities without the robust experiential and contextual knowledge, as well as the deep understanding of the different perspectives, is a recipe for disaster, with more injuries than cure. While it is easy to point towards the negatives of non-intervention, we must consider that there are better ways to mediate the problems. Building lasting relations with the troubled nations, supporting them by providing them with the necessary resources to solve their problems while respecting their autonomy, will in many instances be more favourable than intervention that, in most cases, leads to resentment and resistance towards the intervening party. Ultimately, with the knowledge that autonomy and respect are key components of the method of resolution, it is vital that we allow nations going through domestic issues to work out their problems in their ways, rather than assuming our ways are better.",
                "ing about change in others, disregards their people's cultural beliefs and values. The Brunei government's move to implement a strict anti-LGBT law that includes stoning to death has been met with widespread international condemnation. However, the backlash seems to have further entrenched their government's resolve, seeing it as an attack on their culture, traditions and religious beliefs. While the action is morally and universally repugnant, intervention risks an arguably greater risk to their people's consciousness, devolution, and nationhood, thus variously exacerbating the very problem we sought to sort out.\nIn conclusion, intervention to sort out another country's issues often does more harm than good. As noble as the idea of helping a struggling nation may seem, the vested interests, the lack of understanding of the country's cultural and social context, and the lack of resources are often proof that such ventures are rarely effective and have limited success. Instead, the better approach is for countries to sort out their own internal issues. This approach, while seemingly less guided, often leads to more success and less backlash.",
                "ing supposedly much-needed solutions, often leads to unintended consequences. Take, for example, the US intervention in Iraq. The misreading of the conflict and the installation of a government that did not reflect the nuances of the people's belief systems resulted in sectarian tensions spiralling out of control and the emergence of ISIS. Critically, the question we should ask ourselves is whether we truly have the necessary understanding to meddle in other countries' affair. It is my opinion that not only do we not possess such knowledge and understanding of complex issues, but the very act of intervention might create new and worse issues, often with consequences beyond what we can anticipate.\nIn conclusion, as much as the world desires to lend a helping hand to countries in conflict, it must be done with great caution. We must first acknowledge and examine our own motivations, before attributing them to others. We also need to recognise that we are not equipped with the ability to comprehend the cultural contexts of societies, and any interventions may consequently be counterproductive. Therefore, we should allow countries to manage their own issues while remaining prepared to lend a helping hand when genuinely solicited. With proper guidance and support, countries can overcome their own problems in their own unique and sustainable methods. The introduction of a third-party lens of solutions may not necessarily be to the bespoke needs of the ailment. Therefore, let us encourage and create an environment conducive to self-reliance and sustainable long-term solutions to the world's problems."

As the Chancellor of Germany, a nation with laudable economic health and system, it is little wonder that Angela Merkel is the second most powerful person in the world. This same quality has allowed Singapore, a tiny island-nation, to have a loud voice on international matters. Evidently, sound economic policies and sustained development are essential in the reputation of nations and their leaders. The same clout then enables the nation's welfare to be protected, without being subject to the generosity of those in power. Greece's financial crisis rendered them vulnerable and at the mercy of Germany. While Greece sought a bailout, they were compelled to undergo the crippling experience of a complete breakdown of the system and entertain the possibility of austerity measures as condition for future assistance from its wealthier European counterparts. This makes it abundantly clear that economic development is needed to ensure a nation's well-being.\nThat said, there is something absolutely noble about turning one's back on economic matters and focussing on the intangibles instead. Beyond mere economic pursuit, once that has been achieved, the nation's well-being would divorce from the material pursuits. This is when the Nordic countries seem to shine the way. Not known for rapid economic development nor productivity in the way that Asia has set the bar, countries like Norway, Finland, and Denmark illuminate the way forward for national welfare. Finland has on of the best education systems in the world, a trait that would have been exploited by innumerable other nations to boost economic growth, yet Finland channels its best people into education for long-term betterment. Not materially, but intangibly. Norway's expenditure on criminals, even recalcitrant ones like Anders Breivik, could have gone a long way in boosting productivity or development, but Norway believes in being human and humane. These examples show that while a nation's well-being is typically dependent on economic development, it may not be so for nations which have attained enough to meet its needs. For these privileged nations, their well-being then veers away from the pursuit of economic development, on to other areas that are often intangible, and with it, something to be truly proud of.\nAll in all, it is apparent that a nation's well-being is largely dependent on economic development, whether past or present. The issue is not then the mandate to push for even more economic development, but to realise it is just a means to the end. True well-being is the freedom for governments to do what is best of the nation and people, without needing to fear that they will be ousted for it.",

For example, Singapore's development has led to the improvement of healthcare facilities, making healthcare services more accessible and affordable to citizens. Additionally, the country has invested heavily in its infrastructure, improving transportation and connectivity. This has made it easier for people to travel and access goods and services.\n\nHowever, the claim that a country's well-being is only dependent on its economic development is not entirely true. Economic development can sometimes lead to negative effects on the environment and social well-being of the population. For example, the economic development of some countries has led to deforestation, pollution, and environmental degradation. This can have negative effects on human health and well-being. Additionally, economic development can lead to income inequality. This is because some people may benefit more than others from the economic development, leading to an unequal distribution of wealth and opportunities. Income inequality can lead to social unrest and create a sense of dissatisfaction among the population.\n\nFurthermore, economic development can lead to a heavy dependence on a few industries. This can lead to instability when the industries experience a downturn. For example, many countries in the Middle East are heavily dependent on the oil industry. This has led to economic instability when there is a drop in global oil prices. Therefore, the reliance on one industry can have detrimental effects on the economy and the well-being of the population.\n\nIn conclusion, a country's well-being can be influenced by its economic development. Economic development can lead to improvement in job opportunities, higher income levels, and the improvement of infrastructure and healthcare facilities. However, the claim that a country's well-being is solely dependent on its economic development is not true. Economic development can lead to environmental degradation, income inequality, and a heavy dependence on a few industries.

There are intangible factors like social cohesion, political stability, and environmental sustainability that also affect the overall well-being of a nation. This is where the argument against economic development comes in. Critics argue that economic development often leads to environmental degradation and social inequality, which ultimately harms the well-being of the nation. The case in point is China, a nation that has seen tremendous economic growth, but at the cost of air and water pollution, and social inequality. The result is an increasingly discontent population that is starting to feel the effects of a damaged environment. Hence, while economic development may be necessary, it must be accompanied by measures to ensure environmental and social sustainability.\n\nIn conclusion, economic development is undeniably important in ensuring the well-being of a nation, but it is not the only factor. Sustainability, self-sufficiency, and material needs are important, but so are social cohesion, political stability, and environmental sustainability.

It is important to acknowledge that well-being encompasses more than just wealth and material goods. Other factors such as social stability, political freedoms, and overall happiness must also be considered. Norway, despite being one of the top nations in terms of economic development and prosperity, was only ranked 13th by the World Happiness Report of 2020. It would be foolish to disregard the importance of other factors such as social welfare and political progress in ensuring a nation's well-being. Moreover, economic development that is not sustainable or equitable can prove to be damaging to a nation's long term well-being. The high speed rail project in Thailand was criticized for the massive debts it would bring about, potentially hindering the nation's growth in the long run. It is important for economic development policies to be sustainable and not sacrifice long term growth for short term gains.\n\nIn conclusion, economic development is an important element in ensuring the well-being of a nation, as it provides the necessary means to cater to the material needs of a nation's people, as well as ensure continued self-sufficiency and sustainability. However, it is important to recognize that well-being comprises more than just wealth and that other factors like social stability, political freedoms, and overall happiness must also be considered.

Factors such as social cohesion, political stability, healthcare, education and environmental sustainability play a crucial role in determining the overall well-being of a nation. For instance, the Nordic countries like Denmark and Sweden exhibit high levels of social cohesion, low levels of income inequality, high quality healthcare and education systems, and remarkable environmental sustainability practices. These factors contribute to their citizens\u2019 overall satisfaction and happiness, trumping even wealthier nations like the United States. Similarly, Bhutan's Gross National Happiness index, which measures non-economic factors like spiritual well-being, psychological well-being, and cultural diversity, is indicative of the nation's ability to prioritize non-tangible factors in their nation's well-being, instead of solely relying on economic development.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic development does play a vital role in ensuring the well-being of a nation, it is not the only factor that contributes to it. Tangible factors like income, healthcare and education provide for the basic needs of a nation, but intangible factors like social cohesion, environmental sustainability and cultural diversity are also vital.

The well-being of a nation encompasses far more than just numbers and figures. It entails the provision of basic human needs such as food, healthcare, education, and safety. Economic development certainly helps in providing these necessities, but it is not a foolproof method. Even in nations with good economic development, inequality and poverty still exist, such as in the United States and India. The COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the fragility of the global economy, with nations experiencing recession and unemployment rates skyrocketing. It is evident that economic development is not enough to guarantee a nation's well-being; other factors such as a strong social welfare system, good governance, and a sense of community, are essential as well.\nIn conclusion, while economic development is important in providing the material needs of a nation and ensuring sustainable growth, it is not sufficient to guarantee the wellbeing of a nation. A more comprehensive approach that considers all aspects of human well-being, including the social and emotional, must be taken.

Economic development is a means to an end, not the end itself. While essential to ensuring a certain level of material need is met, it is not sufficient if other non-material needs are lacking. For instance, while China may have achieved rapid economic growth over the past few decades, the material wealth often comes at a cost to non-material elements such as the environment and social welfare. The country is grappling with issues such as pollution and income inequality, which also impact the well-being of citizens. It is hence crucial for policymakers to not solely focus on economic development and overlook other important aspects that contribute to the overall well-being of a nation.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic development can contribute to the well-being of a nation, it is not the be-all and end-all. It is important to acknowledge the role of other non-material factors such as social welfare, environmental sustainability and happiness.

Physical and mental health, education, security, and a sense of community, to name a few, all contribute to the well-being of a nation. While economic development can indeed help achieve some of these non-tangible goals, it is not a guarantee. Take the United States, for instance, a nation with immense economic power, but still struggles with issues of poverty, gun violence, and healthcare. Similarly, Singapore, a nation long praised for its economic development, still struggles with mental health and work-life balance issues among its people. Development in material wealth does not necessarily translate to development in other areas of well-being. \n\nThus, it is imperative that a nation looks beyond just economic development in ensuring the welfare of its people. Policies and strategies must be implemented to address these non-tangible aspects of well-being, with economic development serving as one of many tools to achieve them, rather than the sole solution. To put it succinctly, while economic development can and often does lead to the well-being of a nation, it is by no means a definitive answer.",

This may be viewed as an unsustainable development of the nation, since it does not factor in the individual's well-being as a criterion in measuring the nation's progress. Hence, while economic development is important, it is equally important that other factors such as mental health, work-life balance, and social welfare are also prioritised.\n\nIn conclusion, economic development is undoubtedly a crucial factor in ensuring the well-being of a nation, as it provides financial stability and sustainability.

The reality is that it is understandably difficult to pin down a satisfactory definition of \"well-being\", but it is clear that it cannot be reduced to traditional economic indicators, the very same ones that have failed to capture qualitative aspects like happiness and social relationships. The recent global financial crisis, arguably caused by unchecked economic development, forced many people to reassess the efficacy of such efforts and to analyze the negative externalities brought about by a focus on quantity over quality. In a few words, economic development is not the panacea for a nation's woes, and environmental degradation, social inequality, and alienation can be the cost of unfettered capitalism. This is evident in countries like China, where soaring economic growth and development have come at a high price, such as high levels of pollution and severe wealth inequality, leading to social instability and unrest.\nTo conclude, it seems clear that economic development, while important for material well-being, is not all that is necessary for the overall flourishing of a nation. Indeed, one might argue that the neglect of qualitative indicators like happiness, social connectivity, and social justice may result in a nation that, while financially successful, may have embittered its people and got them to despise the very system that created this wealth. It is essential, therefore, for a nation to recognize holistic and long-term wellbeing as the real goal for its people, while of course not neglecting the physical necessities.

For example, a nation must have a strong sense of social cohesion and peace in order to truly prosper. In countries where there are intense internal conflicts like Syria and Yemen, the well-being of their people is severely compromised, despite possessing vast natural resources. Similarly, countries with a poor human rights record like North Korea or Saudi Arabia cannot truly boast of the well-being of their citizens, regardless of their economic standing. This is because the rights and freedoms of an individual are often non-negotiable or should at least be considered inviolable for a society to thrive. Finally, we cannot forget about environmental concerns when discussing a nation's well-being. A country that irreparably damages its environment or ecosystem will inevitably suffer negative consequences in the long run, which cannot be solved by any level of economic prosperity.\n\nThus, it is important to acknowledge that economic development is not the only factor that contributes to a nation's well-being, although it undoubtedly plays a significant role. While it is understandable that governments need to prioritize economic development as a means of ensuring welfare for their citizens, they must also recognize the importance of maintaining social cohesion, upholding human rights and preserving the environment for the long-term benefit of all.

There are also instances where economic development has led to social and cultural degradation, like in the case of Bali. The inflow of tourism has led to over-development, pollution and loss of cultural identity. This is why we need to balance economic development with other factors like social, cultural and environmental development, so that the overall well-being of the nation is catered for.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that economic development is critical to ensuring the well-being of a nation, especially in our capitalist world. However, there is a need to look at the impact of economic development beyond mere material gains, to factors like social equality, cultural preservation and environmental sustainability.

            "human_gen_truncate": "timent. Despite some existence of the impatience and frustration that rears its ugly head every once in a while, the fatalistic notion of consequent irrelevance as inevitable overlooks the need for adjustment to changing demographic shifts, which although uncomfortable, is rather temporary. As much as there are a number of societies still negotiating the changes, there are many that have successfully adjusted its mindsets and policies to support the needs of the growing silver generation in their population. From atop the list of ageing populations, Japan has successfully found a place in its heart and well-oiled economy to accommodate the elderly, who take on meaningful tasks with the traditional skills few youths have, and who contribute to the community in ways considered less effortful and more suited to the realities of old age. In other ageing societies, the old are far from just useless burdens, cast aside and preserved in the name of ethical duty. It is evident that besides the initial adjustment and irreverent few voices that cast doubt, the old have a place in society.\nAdmittedly, some sympathetic individuals have expressed pity and concern for the old who they perceive to have no place today, considering the degree of technological advancement that drives our world today. There is fear that the rapid progress and seemingly ever-changing processes are far too much for the old who would supposedly feel out of place and obsolete, in a way that the old from other times would plausibly not. Putting aside the fact that this conjecture is a construct of imagination and laced with some well-intentioned stereotypes, this view, in its zeal for compassion, under-estimated the ability of the old to learn and overlooked the abundance of resources now available to quench the insatiable thirst for knowledge and self-improvement, both of which are unaffected by age. As much as age has been a convenient excuse to justify a lack of interest, effort, and success, especially when it comes to learning, this argument fails to hold water when we consider the sheer amount of options now available to facilitate the learning of the older generation. The subsequent silver invasion into domains once solely dominated by the young, such as social media platforms, reveal the undeniable truth that when the old desire it, they have a wealth of resources to enable them to get it. Today, they reign over social media platforms that the young hurriedly left behind, finding more ways to make use of the platforms, be it livestreams of garage sales or sharing of the latest health tips. The elderly are able to, and have embraced technology, thus cannot be considered obsolete, especially when we realise that the efforts to help the old and resources provided are, in fact, clear indications of the continued relevance of the old.\nIn the face of the arguments on empowerment and resources, the most staunch would still insist that the frailty of old age means less place for the old in society. This is arguably exacerbated by the limits that have been pushed in terms of medically-preserved decrepitude. As individuals age, it seems logical to no longer retain the physical prowess associated with youth in their peak physical states. Medical issues seem to creep up and ageing bodies try to negotiate the issues to compensate for, and carry on, some semblance of life. The feared fall of an elderly, the dreaded hip replacement or knee replacement, are some physical issues faced. The intangible senile dementia and other conditions add to the fray, with the old already embroiled in this private struggle. Thankfully, the concerns surrounding health in old age have been largely mitigated by the powerful strides in technology that has the ability to negate the ravages of time. Physiology has been thoroughly studied and many treatments and interventions developed. From the media's hype over ordinary women who defy time by looking like they are their children's ages, we can see that the old have access to and employed techniques to overcome these physical limitations. Even for the mind, there are many pharmaceutical interventions, such as to delay and even reverse brain ageing. Clearly, technology can, or at least soon, ensure the old still have a place in society. I do concede that such tools and benefits may not be available to all the elderly in every society. The availability of the resources and efforts are still predicated on one's wealth and thus not readily accessible to everyone. Still, the circumstance that the old find themselves in is not without reprieve. As we look beyond today, we need to help the old and those without resources to be able to seek the help they need.\nAll in all, our cynicism, fears, and criticisms, may tempt us into downplaying the place for the old, but we need to keep a rational mind to focus on the place they have. With the world staring down a silver tsunami, it is best we make pace with any existing issues to help our society, young and old through the next set of challenges. A convenient scapegoat the old may be, it is still unwise to give them up as sacrifice whenever any polarising poll comes around. Before blaming \"Brexit\" on the old, it would make more sense to listen to the views in an objective manner and understand the issues, rather than take the easy way out by blaming the old.",

This mistreatment of the elderly is harmful as it perpetuates a cycle of exclusion and marginalisation that can have negative effects on older adults' physical and emotional well-being. To combat this, society needs to take a holistic view of the elderly\u2019s contributions and appreciate their worth.\n\nIt is indispensable, then, that society take an inclusive approach to the elderly's participation. Strategies such as lifelong learning programs, retraining opportunities, and other measures that can help equip older adults with the skills necessary to participate in the modern workforce must become part of policy efforts. Moreover, citing technology as a barrier to entry into the workforce should not exclude older adults, and indeed, there is much evidence showing that older adults are willing to adapt to technological advancements when given the chance. Government policies aimed at supporting and empowering the elderly, such as healthcare and social welfare programs, are critical to ensuring that older adults have dignity, economic security and access to healthcare.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst some might argue that the elderly have no place in modern society, there are numerous reasons why this view is not tenable. Older adults have much to offer society as caregivers, volunteers and active participants in the workforce, and there is a need for society to develop strategies that encourage their participation, rather than exclude them. Policies and societal attitudes that promote inclusion and equal treatment of elderly persons can only benefit our aging society, promoting social cohesion, and ensuring a life of quality and dignity for older citizens.",

It ignores the efforts in place that have made it easier for the old to attain their needs and maintain their dignity in an ever-evolving society. For example, healthcare services for the elderly have improved significantly, with dedicated facilities and subsidies in place for those who need it. Additionally, opportunities for the elderly to remain active and engaged in society have increased, with community activities and volunteer opportunities that allow them to contribute to society in meaningful ways. Furthermore, intergenerational programs have gained significant traction in many societies, bringing the young and old together in meaningful ways to bridge the gap and promote mutual understanding and appreciation. These efforts underscore the inherent value of the old in society and demonstrate that the perception that they have no place is grossly misplaced.\nIn conclusion, the idea that the old have no place in society today is a flawed and shortsighted one. While it is true that there are challenges that come with demographic changes and an ever-changing society, the old continue to play a vital role as anchors that preserve core values and prevent society from tipping too far into the unknown. Moreover, efforts have been made to make it easier for the elderly to attain their needs and maintain their dignity in a rapidly-evolving society. As such, to suggest that they have no place in society is to ignore the significant contributions they continue to make and the critical role they play in shaping the course of society.",

The old have been the backbone of society for a long time, having contributed their efforts and resources in raising families, creating institutions, and shaping the socio-economic landscape in which we have thrived. It is undeniable that the older folks have done a tremendous amount of hard work and made significant sacrifices to build the world which the younger generations today enjoy. The fact remains that the contributions of the old are valuable; they are not only pre-requisites to the present state of affairs but also fundamental to whatever direction our society takes in the future.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the belief that the old have no place in society is a flawed one. Whether in terms of safeguarding traditions, preserving the values that form the core of our societies or contributing to the worldwide socio-economic landscape, the old play an essential role in society today. While the world may seem overwhelming for some of them, they provide the stability that has given the younger generations the chance to make the most out of themselves and their communities. The way forward is thus not to ignore or dismiss the contributions of the old but to recognise them, honour them, and carry them forward. It is only by doing so that we can genuinely appreciate the sacrifices that they have made and ultimately uphold their legacy.",

While it is true that there are valid concerns about the burden of healthcare costs and the need to encourage ageing-in-place, we must be careful not to fall into the trap of viewing the old as helpless and doomed to being a drain on society. The old are not only significant contributors to society through their roles as parents, caregivers, volunteers and workers, their experiences and wisdom make them valuable sources of knowledge for younger people, who are trying to make sense of the complex world around them. Furthermore, as society becomes increasingly diverse and complex, the old can play a significant role in bridging the generational gaps that exist. Certainly, this may require a shift in mindset and some flexibility, but it is a change we must make for the betterment of society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns about the place of the old in society today, we must be careful not to fall into simplistic and binary modes of thinking. It is far too easy to romanticise the past, and ignore the challenges faced by the old and the young today. Instead, we should recognize that the old are an integral part of our society and appreciate the contributions they make. At the same time, we must also work to address structural and systemic issues, such as ageism and healthcare costs, that may hinder their ability to continue contributing meaningfully.

It is undeniable that the absolute numbers of the old are growing rapidly, and the burden on society is indeed a concern, but that should not be conflated with the old having no place in society at all. On the contrary, the challenges that the old face present the opportunity for society to evolve and recalibrate its approach, with the aim of not merely supporting the older generation but to facilitate their flourishing in society. The recent trend of \u201cactive ageing\u201d promotes the active involvement of the elderly in society, encouraging the older generation to continue contributing to society through means that are both meaningful and fulfilling. This way, the elderly can be valued members of society, contributing to society in the way that suits them best while simultaneously catering to their unique needs and wants. These efforts show that the old are not merely burdens to society but resources that can bring value to society and should be treated as such.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the old today still have a place in society, contrary to what some may argue. While the old may not be as attuned to the latest societal changes or be able to keep up with the pace of society, they serve an important function as the normative last defenders of the values we hold dear. While there are indeed challenges in accommodating the old, particularly when it comes to care and support, it is crucial that society learns to adapt and evolve, not to isolate the elderly but to facilitate their flourishing in society. In doing so, we can create a society that values the contributions of the old while preparing for its own demographic transformation.",

The old, therefore, according to them, are burdens to society that have outlived their usefulness, leaving a society in which younger generations are required to shoulder the responsibility for the aged.

Instead, the increasing numbers of the aged and societal evolution entail that we adapt to the changing environment, especially as the old play a role in providing wisdom and a historical perspective that aids our understanding of the past and the present for better decision-making in the future.\nIn conclusion, the notion that the old have no place in society today, while perhaps understandable, is misguided. Indeed, the changes that have taken place may require a degree of adaptation to the old and young alike, even if the old may not be entirely up-to-date with the latest trends. In so doing, we must not be quick to dismiss their role in society as outdated or irrelevant while recognising that they are not in the same position as in years past. Rather, we need to value their wisdom, experience, and historical perspective, all of which serve as invaluable assets to society.

However, it is crucial to recognise the significant contributions that the old have made to society during their prime years, which have laid the foundation for the current society. They have contributed to the society in various ways, ranging from manual labour to high-level intellectual work. The older generation has amassed vast knowledge, wisdom, and lessons from their lives that only come with years of experience. This knowledge is priceless, as it can be shared and passed on to the younger generation, allowing the society to learn from its past and not repeat the same mistakes. The idea of the old being burdensome also defies the basic principles of humanity, where their contributions and presence should be valued and respected, regardless of their physical capabilities.\nIn conclusion, the old have undoubtedly faced significant challenges in contemporary society, with some arguing that they no longer hold any value. However, it is crucial to recognise the vital role the old still play in society as the keepers of important knowledge and the last bulwark against rapid and often problematic change.

The old today are more highly educated and informed compared with the elderly in past societies, irrespective of age and social conditions. With the advantages that come with decades of experience, the old today are both technically and socially more adept than their counterparts of old, thereby continuing to be of significant value to the societies they are part of. As the elderly population increases, the absence of the elderly would leave a void that is difficult to fill, while proving unmistakably harmful to society.\nIn conclusion, the contention that the old have no place in current societies of the world is untenable, notwithstanding the many views that may seem to support such reasoning. In any age, the old have been characterised by their stereotypes society has imposed on them. Invariably, the elderly have found ways of transcending their demographic barriers, thereby getting to occupy a vital space in societies' foundations. Today, the elderly are more diverse, educated, and informed than in past societies.

Moreover, with age comes valuable qualities like compassion, wisdom, and patience, qualities that our society would do well to preserve. As such, the old can bring considerable value to society, with endless possibilities on how their knowledge can be used in areas like mentorship, volunteerism, and advocacy to shape the world into a better place.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the old have a different outlook on the world, slowly being supplanted by the younger generation, one must not make the mistake of assuming that the old have no place in society. Rather, the rapid changes in our time necessitate the relevance of mediation and compromise that only the old, with their vast wealth of knowledge, can provide. This transfer of knowledge, when combined with the enthusiasm and innovation of the young, truly offers the potential to create a society that is more emboldened, empathetic and robust.

Furthermore, it must also recognise and leverage the value that the experience and wisdom of the old bring to the table. Whether through mentorship programs or advisory roles, there are numerous avenues for the old to continue to make meaningful contributions and remain engaged in society.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the old in society today still have a place, albeit a different one compared to in the past. While they may no longer hold the same positions of power and influence as before, their value in society should not be measured in terms of their productivity or economic contributions alone. Rather, their value lies in the unique perspectives and insights that they bring to the table, and the lessons that they can impart to younger generations. As society continues to change at an ever-increasing pace, the role of the old in providing a sense of continuity and stability becomes even more crucial.

Furthermore, elderly individuals have been shown to be capable of contributing to society in many ways. In Singapore, there are many elderly volunteers dedicating their time and effort to social causes, such as teaching children how to read or donating their time to the elderly in palliative care. Additionally, older individuals also possess knowledge and experiences that can only be gained through time, and these can be leveraged for innovation or decision-making in many industries. By dismissing the elderly as burdensome or helpless, we risk losing out on all that they have to offer.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be tempting to view the elderly population as obsolete and out of touch with modern cosmopolitan societies, this is a shortsighted and flawed perspective. The elderly are a valuable and integral part of society, possessing experiences, knowledge, and values that help to keep society grounded and steady amidst rapid change. As we continue to age as a global population, it will serve us well to remember the role that the elderly play and to look for ways to integrate their contributions into society in meaningful and respectful ways."

            "human_gen_truncate": "n women, especially the Dalit women, has been made the scapegoat for the division and lack of progress in the Indian society. Yet, such a fatalistic and pessimistic view overlooks the possibility of some progress and maturity in the society, albeit in the long run. The risk-averse approach focusses too much on the short-run threat, without giving due consideration to the possible progress that can be gained in the long run. This is not to say that the endeavour would be eventually successful or to even bear some fruit in gender equality. Instead, it is entirely likely that we would be condemned to the perpetual over-compensation that the pursuit of gender equality serves to constantly result in. Rather, what makes the endeavour meaningful, and not foolish as claimed by the pessimists, is the development of the maturity of the populace and, dare I suggest, the advancement of society and civilisation. As much as we have yet to have any true equality of the sexes, we can infer the potential of such pursuits of equality between criminals and non-criminals. The enlightened approach seen in the Nordic countries had been sparked by the humanitarian emphasis on equality. Norway's revolutionary, world's-first commitment to equality, seen in the Halden Prison and the Bastoy Island Prison, had its genesis in the pursuit of equality at the realisation of the cruel ways previously employed on juvenile delinquents in the Boys' Home on Bastoy Island itself. The contemporary island retreat of a prison is testament to the progress such pursuits can bring. While true that these Scandinavian countries are, for now, rather lonely in such enlightenment, what is undeniable is the prerequisite of the pursuit for equality in the long-term progress of the society. Hence, as much as the pursuit of equality between the sexes is unlikely to bear fruit, given that it is perhaps one of the only inequalities backed by actual differences in biology, the pursuit itself is hardly foolish as it is a necessary first step in societal progress.\nOn a more practical note, the admittedly futile effort is still not foolish when we consider the actual need for change in gender roles and responsibilities brought about by the changing circumstances, which the pursuit would facilitate. The world today is changing rapidly in terms of technological advancement, altering the situation in societies, cost of living, and also work demands. Along with these, society's expectations with respect to gender roles, procreation, and family, have also shifted. Some more significantly than other perhaps, but nonetheless, changed and are still changing. As a result, the entrenched gender inequality would prove to be a hurdle for the required changes to keep up with changing societal needs. Hence, even when the pursuit of gender inequality would likely fail to bring about true equality in terms of access to opportunities, it is a worthwhile endeavour as it crucially paves the way for much needed changes that facilitate society's adapting to the changing circumstances in order to survive, much less thrive. This can be seen in the Finnish society, which is often held up as a guiding light for equality, where females are given concessions and support so that motherhood would not unfairly penalise them. Putting aside the controversial argument that this is equality in practice, when so clearly the men do not have access to similar concessions, what is evident is that the society has benefitted from the pursuit of equality, in that the effort has been leveraged upon to make much-needed changes to the landscape of work and socio-exploitation of human resources to ensure Finland's continued survival in the modern world. The same can be said of the Chinese in mainland China, which in the name of gender equality, has made being a leftover woman a badge of honour to harness the previously unexploited potential of the female population. In South Sudan, the practice of abusing fattening pills to achieve the societal standard of feminine beauty, at the expense of health, is now criticised, again under the banner of gender equality, to ensure the populace moves away from such wastage of resources and onto the empowerment that would help improve the pitiable plight of the impoverished nation saddled by traditional notions steeped in gender subjugation. Evidently, as much as the pursuit is indeed futile, the potential of the endeavour as a means to ensure society is able to keep up with changing circumstances makes it far from foolish.\nIn all, the pursuit of gender equality is likely to be futile, given the complexities and subjectivity of the notion, not to mention the entrenched mindsets that hinder any effort. Still, it is far from foolish considering the consequent debate, empowerment, and its potential as a tool for progress and advancement. As much as it is a thorny topic and a source of frustration for many, we must resist the temptation to surrender the pursuit using the simplistic assertion that futility equates folly. Instead, we should recognise the excuse for what it is and look beyond its immediate futility to recognise its central role in our growth, be it personal or societal. Perhaps another way of looking at it is to realise that it is more foolish to succumb and accept limitations as told, for if Serena Williams did, she would not have made it to the top hundred list, nor become the inspiration for so many in the world.",

Additionally, when women are able to work and earn a living, they are able to provide for themselves and their families, reducing poverty and improving overall quality of life.\n\nAnother argument against pursuing equality between the sexes is that it is futile because it is impossible to completely eradicate sexism and discrimination. While it is true that there will always be some level of sexism and discrimination in society, this does not mean that we should not try to eliminate it. Just because a problem is difficult to solve does not mean that it is not worth addressing. In fact, the fact that sexism and discrimination are so deeply ingrained in society is exactly why it is so important to address them.\n\nFinally, pursuing equality between the sexes is a matter of justice and human rights. Women are human beings and deserve to be treated with dignity, respect, and equality. Denying women their basic human rights is not only unjust, but it goes against the very principles of democracy and freedom. As a society, we should strive to create a world where everyone, regardless of gender, race, or any other characteristic, is treated equally and fairly.\n\nIn conclusion, pursuing equality between the sexes is not only necessary, but it is also the only way to create a just and equitable society. While there are those who argue that it is futile or foolish, the benefits of equality are clear. When men and women are treated equally and given the same opportunities, everyone benefits.

There is some merit in their argument, but they miss the point that the endeavour is not about achieving specific, concrete outcomes. Instead, it is about the belief and ideology that equality matters and that it is an ideal that is worth speaking up for, even if the results are futile. The fact that society is grappling with the notion of equality is a testament to the fact that the pursuit has already borne some fruit, even if it is just in the form of awareness. The sense of heightened awareness already means that individuals are becoming more sensitive to issues surrounding equality, and are more willing to listen and empathise with those who are less fortunate. The conversation that has been sparked also means that society is becoming more open-minded, and it is even possible that it could lead to incremental changes that could bring about more substantive progress in the future. Even if the advocates of gender equality fail, there is still value in the pursuit as it galvanises society to focus on the overarching theme of equity, and it could lead to larger, more meaningful changes in society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, while I acknowledge that the pursuit of gender equality is probably futile, I hold the view that it is not foolish. There is value in the pursuit as it has spawned discussion, awareness, and even empowerment in some contexts. Despite the challenge that inherently exists when it comes to equalising the sexes, society can still derive value from the debate that ensues. While it may not result in concrete action immediately, it has a real chance of causing a snowball effect that could lead to substantive changes in the future.

Yet, while the debate may not always be conclusive, the discussion of the issue is nonetheless immensely valuable to the society's growth and development.

After all, the government response was not only insufficient, but also too controversial, leading to criticism from both the left and right, with the opposition and feminists offering the usual criticisms, and the more traditional groups voicing their dismay. However, the pursuit of gender equality is not foolish, as it represents a beacon of hope for our humanity in the long run. Society is not static, and I believe that the pursuit will allow for the expanding of the horizons of the less powerful gender. The futile and often-times controversial pursuit of gender equality should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of the larger efforts to expand the scope of human rights and dignity. While it is easy to dismiss the efforts as meaningless, particularly when we reflect on the slow pace of progress, human society is not static, and the pursuit should provide some optimism for the future. After all, it was not so long ago that the concept of having a woman on the board of a corporation or as the leader of a nation was inconceivable. While we are not there yet, the mere fact that most of us now consider that possibility demonstrates just how far we have come. The slow progressions of history may sometimes seem imperceptible, but through these incremental changes, human society can advance. In this vein, the pursuit of gender equality is not foolish, but a reflection of hope for a better future.\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging its futility, I believe that the pursuit of gender equality is not foolish, as it results in valuable debate, empowerment, and hope for a better future.",

The fact that gender equality only benefits a small proportion of the population, those who happen to be educated, urban, and middle-class, makes the whole pursuit of gender equality even more pointless in their eyes. It is perhaps understandable that they would harbour such a stance, as any social change is bound to create waves in the already turbulent sea of social mores and values. There is no denying that the pursuit of equality between the sexes is challenged, and any realistic person would know that it is futile. Notwithstanding, the more idealistic among us would see the pursuit as being of value. The debate that ensues, the empowerment that is borne out of the pursuit, and the hope for a better society in the long run are justifications enough for the whole effort. As such, while I do acknowledge the futility of gender equality, I do not consider it to be foolish after all.",

Such an eventuality is well within the realm of possibility for any society seeking to pursue gender equality. Thus, it may well be to the detriment of society that any pursuit of gender equality is pursued, rendering the endeavour completely foolish.\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of gender equality is fraught with nuance and complexities and is ultimately futile, I cannot agree that it is entirely foolish. The debate and attention it generates serve the important principle of highlighting injustice and advocating for the rights of the disenfranchised. Further, while the emphasis may not result in outright equality, it does ameliorate the situation and empower those who are most vulnerable. However, for the staunchly pragmatic, the potential costs to society are simply not worth the effort.

This is especially so when extremists on either side hold sway in public discourse. In such circumstances, the pursuit of gender equality is indeed a foolish and risky move, and those who advocate it would do well to recognise that balance is essential in society. There is a price to be paid for everything, and the pursuit of gender equality can be an expensive one. The more sensible approach would be to find a middle ground, where the benefits of gender equality can be tamped down with minimal social disturbances caused.\n\nIn conclusion, while pursuing gender equality is indeed a futile endeavour fraught with challenges, it is not necessarily foolish. The discussion that it engenders and the empowerment of the disenfranchised render it worthy even though the ultimate goal may never be achieved. However, it is equally important to note that the pursuit of gender equality should not be pursued rashly, as it may well cause more harm than good. In this sense, I urge everyone to approach the subject with caution and a sense of balance, for ultimately it is only through dialogue and understanding that society can be brought together instead of being driven apart.",

It is rather simplistic to dismiss a cause as significant as gender equality by labeling it as a \"foolish pursuit.\" Despite the complexities in achieving equality among the genders, I perceive the pursuit of the same to be a noble cause. Such a pursuit is not only for the betterment of women worldwide, but it is also for the betterment of all human society. The pursuit of gender equality has resulted in movements that celebrate the achievements and accomplishments of women globally, such as Women\u2019s Day celebrations. By acknowledging the equality between genders, society has been able to achieve progress in all dimensions, including science, the arts, and service to others.

The value of the ideal itself necessitates the pursuit of gender equality. The value of treating every individual with equal dignity and respect is not something that can be quantified in cost-benefit terms. It is a moral imperative. The pursuit of gender equality represents the most basic level of respect that an individual deserves simply because they are human. It is this principle that should guide our efforts, rather than an emphasis on the cost-benefit analysis that is so often employed in the pragmatic argument.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the pursuit of gender equality may seem futile, the inherent value of the ideal itself necessitates that we continue to strive towards it. The discussion that ensues from this pursuit is invaluable, and the empowerment of the disenfranchised gender is a significant benefit. At its core, however, the pursuit of gender equality represents the basic respect that every individual deserves as a human being.

Hence, a sense of history sheds Singapore wisdom in her future dealings with realpolitik in international relations.\nSimultaneously, having a sense of history allows citizens to form a sense of identity and belonging. The social stability in modern Singapore\u2019s social stability did not come without challenges. During the 1950 to the mid-1960s, post-war Singapore underwent a dark age of civil unrest, most of which occurred on racial lines. While still part of Malaysia, the 1964 Racial riots left 36 dead and 556 injured when violence between ethnic Chinese and Malays groups. The conflict was spurred by members of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant political party in peninsula Malaysia, inciting Malays in Singapore to violently press for their \u2018Special Rights.\u2019 At that time, the local PAP government campaigned for a \u201cMalaysian Malaysia\u201d in the Malayan Solidarity Convention with other Malaysian opposition parties. The dark ages were formative on Singapore\u2019s practice of \u201cthe principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society\u201d upon independence. These were the very words declared by Mr. Lee Kuan Yew in the Proclamation of Singapore. The rights of minority groups such as the Malays and Indians were ensured by the government, and these minorities were accorded political representation in parliament under the Group Representation Constituency electoral system. Housing and education policies were made such that the races intermingled and embraced diversity, and this has helped weave Singapore\u2019s social fabric. A sense of history hence gives us the ability to better understand and reaffirm the ideals Singapore are built upon, and how we can continue to embrace diversity and not the \u2018universality\u2019 that certain peoples deem as more \u2018right\u2019 than other competing \u2018rights.\u2019\nThis understanding is even more important nowadays, especially when considering how globalisation brings about more intense and rapid social and cultural exchanges. A look back into our past can bring an awakening in the citizenry as to how we can stem incidents such as the unprecedented Little India Riots in 2014, which were sparked by migrant workers over xenophobic concerns. This is on a global backdrop of increased labour flows and migration. A sense of history hence helps Singapore to build upon the \u2018Singapore Identity\u2019, strengthening her multicultural and inter-religious roots. The mutual respect for other will be a helpful implement as the world continues its transit into late-modernity. As the Chinese proverb goes \u201cWhen you drink water, remember the source.\u201d Singaporeans should not forget how racial, religious and even ethnic harmony, not tolerance, has made it possible for them to prosper economically vis-a-vis good governance and pragmatic policies. This has allowed Singapore to remain relevant to the world despite being a small nation-state.\nHistory might never repeat itself, not at least in the same form. However, the process of societal development and nation building, and the conditions which shaped these processes, should not be forgotten in the least. The greatest utility a sense of history gives is in teaching Singapore and her citizenry important lessons about human nature, society and the real world. Among the team of Singapore\u2019s founding fathers was Mr. S. Rajaratnam. He famously proclaimed in a speech that independent Singapore was \u201clike a nun that had wandered by accident into a red-light district.\u201d This was a harsh, yet truthful, description of our situation in Southeast Asia, a harsh geopolitical environment which has also been a traditional battleground for great and emerging powers. To continue to remain relevant to the world and thrive in a world of globalisation, Singaporeans should never forget our historical roots. They remind us that success is an act of human endeavor and should be maintained by so, not a godsend, especially to a small nation state.\n",

In addition, Singapore's success in overcoming obstacles indicates that the future generation must be resilient, composed with a critical problem-solving capacity to achieve the shared goal to impact society positively.\n\nLastly, a sense of history helps us to anticipate and prepare for the future. Singapore's historical experience has demonstrated the importance of consistently adapting and embracing change. Embracing change is critical as Singapore has become a global player in trade, innovation, and technological advancement. Many countries have found themselves lagging behind as they failed to anticipate their future and prepare pragmatically fast. For instance, Singapore's foresight in the utilization of technology has helped it gain international recognition as an innovative country globally. Singaporeans must anticipate the future by preparing mental models, imagining the multiple outcomes and scenarios to ensure they are ready for what comes next.\n\nCulture, tradition, and identity are all values that are derived from the past.

Singapore\u2019s growth and development cannot be compartmentalised as a linear, upward trajectory, where every step taken is a clear and bold one. Instead, it was a series of lateral movements met with adaptation to unexpected events. For instance, in the 1970s, Singapore\u2019s manufacturing sector was hit by concurring oil and labour crises that forced a thorough overhaul and diversification of the economy. This diversification provided the necessary foundations for Singapore\u2019s growth in the years to come. \n\nThese lessons of history are still relevant and valuable for Singapore\u2019s future, especially when transitioning towards a more uncertain and disruptive future.

It was a convergence of multiple, non-economic factors and interests. These include her geographical location, cultural diversity, colonial heritage, and most importantly, the founding fathers\u2019 vision of a united and prosperous nation. Thus, a deep sense of history is crucial to ensure that these multiple factors align with the current state policies in order to achieve continued prosperity and success. For example, Singapore\u2019s strategic geographical location at the southernmost tip of the Malay Peninsula necessitates maintaining a delicate balance between having strong diplomatic relations with her neighbors and avoiding being an easy target for regional conflicts. This was emphasized when Singapore was one of the few country outside the Middle East to be affected by the Gulf War in 1990, leading to a loss in tourism and investment. Hence, to navigate through the complex geopolitical web surrounding Singapore today, there needs to be a deep understanding of historical lessons and an appreciation of the intricacies of regional relations.\nIn conclusion, while the past is different from the present, it is poignant to note that the history of Singapore is a compass that helps to navigate our future. A sense of history is necessary when confronting geo-political and socio-cultural issues during this period of transition in Singapore's development. It provides an insight into the nation\u2019s founding principles, key successes, challenges, and aspirations. Singapore\u2019s history is not just a mere academic exercise but is crucial in informing the current policies and strategies of our government, shaping our understanding of regional and international affairs, and ultimately enriching the Singaporean identity.

This led to Singapore\u2019s quick surrender to the Japanese in World War II. Singapore cannot afford to have a similar complacency in the present-day given the ever-changing and fluid geo-political climate. The rise of China and its assertiveness, the increased terror threat and the shifting political dynamics of the region all demand Singapore to be vigilant and agile in guarding her interests and security. A sense of history can remind us that complacency can never be an option, and that we must always be prepared to adapt and evolve to changing circumstances.\nIn conclusion, while Singapore\u2019s past may have been markedly different from the present, a sense of history is still crucial in understanding the underlying tenets and challenges Singapore faces. The lessons we learn from the past will continue to shape Singapore\u2019s responses to future developments, especially with regards to her geo-political and socio-cultural challenges in a period of transition.

Learning from her past provides us with a foundation to understand the present and navigate the future, especially when the circumstances of the past remain relevant today. It helps Singaporeans to identify external threats to her stability and to maintain her internal socio-cultural fabric.

The utilisation of a sense of history is not just a tool of remembrance; it is a tool of survival.\nFurthermore, a sense of history allows Singaporeans to appreciate her unique cultural identity. Placed at the heart of Southeast Asia, Singapore was built on a foundation of trade and commerce. This made her a melting pot for a diverse range of cultures, such as Chinese, Malay, Indian, and European cultures. The importance of identity was highlighted by Mr. Lee Kuan Yew who emphasised that Singapore needs to create a unique identity for it to be recognised as a nation-state, and that Singaporeans have to embrace the three distinct cultures, such as Malay, Indian and Chinese. This is where the term \u2018Multiracialism\u2019 was born, an important tenet in Singaporean society today. Singaporeans understand the need for tolerance and respect for each other\u2019s culture and beliefs. The public holidays celebrated in Singapore reflects this ideology- Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali, Chinese New Year, and Christmas Day. Something that is unique to Singapore and celebrated by all. If Singaporeans were to forget her history, she would also forget her roots and culture - a mistake that can be fatal in a hyper-connected world where cultural identity is an indispensable tool of diplomacy and international relations. \n\nIn conclusion, whilst the contemporary geopolitical and socio-cultural dynamics of Singapore differ greatly from the past, there is no doubt that a sense of history remains crucial in guiding the city-state through her many challenges. Understanding the circumstances of her past ensures that Singapore does not repeat her mistakes and celebrate her successes. It guides her in striking a balance between being pragmatic and being sensitive to the complexities of her diverse society, and aids the forging of dynamic relations with her neighbours. It also helps Singaporeans embrace their unique identity whilst respecting other cultures. A sense of history is thus not a burden, but an invaluable asset that should be cherished and utilised in approaching Singapore\u2019s future.",

National histories are crucial for a society to maintain its collective memory of triumphs and setbacks, heroes and villains. The Singapore Story provides this amid a flux of cultural influences within the city-state, and helps to solidify the Singaporean identity. History also contributes to the shaping of national values and institutions. Singapore\u2019s founding fathers were able to draw on the experiences gained from British colonial governance and Japanese occupation, to create a unique system of governance that drew on the best aspects of both systems and adapted them to local circumstances. The founding of the Housing and Development Board (HDB) and the Central Provident Fund (CPF) are examples of institutions which have contributed significantly to Singapore\u2019s success. \n\nFurthermore, the value of a sense of history extends beyond the state-level and even the national level. As global citizens, it is important to understand the histories of other states to appreciate their circumstances and make informed decisions regarding diplomacy and foreign policy. A shared understanding of history can also foster goodwill between states and peoples. \n\nIn conclusion, while the circumstances that shaped Singapore\u2019s success have changed dramatically, there are still valuable lessons to be learnt from Singapore\u2019s past. Understanding the principles that Singapore was founded on, the challenges faced in the past, and how they were overcome, is crucial in navigating the current challenges faced by the city-state. Furthermore, history contributes to the shaping of national identity, culture and values, and understanding the histories of other states is important for global citizenship. As such, a sense of history remains an important tool for Singapore and her people as they continue to scale new heights in this rapidly evolving global landscape.",

Singapore, for instance, practices a policy of \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019 towards her relation with China, which has been a benevolent trading partner, but whose territorial claims over the South China Sea have raised hackles with ASEAN member states, including Singapore. The approach of \u2018strategic ambiguity\u2019 mirrors the policy of Non-Alignment of the 1960s, when Singapore sought to maintain cordial relations with all major powers, particularly the US and Britain. This approach is guided by the spirit of caution and pragmatism in international relations, and represents a reliance on historical lessons, even in the face of new developments in the cyber and security realm.\nIn conclusion, the utility of a sense of history is invaluable when approaching Singapore\u2019s future. The lessons and insights that can be derived from studying Singapore\u2019s past far exceed the dangers of living in the \u2018ghost of history\u2019. Singapore\u2019s political, economic and social landscape has been built on the backs of her founding fathers, who were moulded by the country\u2019s historical events, and the difficult decisions they had to make to guarantee the survival and prosperity of the Republic. In order to continue to scale new heights in the global arena, Singapore must recognise the significance of history as a foundation upon which to build a better future, in the face of new and emerging challenges."

            "human_gen_truncate": " understanding, and \u2013 in an ideal situation \u2013 world peace.\nHowever, many critics see that the same cultural aspect of globalisation promotes the \u2018cultural imperialism\u2019 of western ideals. This means a greater and more dominant powers (nations) privileging and imposing their ideals over others. When a minority of Hong Kongers took to the streets in the Occupy Central movement over cries of \u2018universal suffrage\u2019, U.S. President Barack Obama pronounced that the U.S. would continue to  speak up for the \u201cright of people\u201d to both protest against and change the elections process determining Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive. More ironically, Hong Kong\u2019s ex-British governor and other British parliamentarians mention \u2018democracy\u2019 in Hong Kong despite her citizens being deprived of any democratic electoral processes under British administration. All this is despite Hong Kong having agreed to the \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 constitution, which grants them not a full, but an altered, form of democracy given her historical circumstances. The aforementioned actions by western leaders have galvanized the protestor\u2019s activism against the Chinese government in Beijing, resulting in a massive economic shutdown and violent clashes. This proves to show that cultural globalisation does have aspects which promote conflict, especially when people feel that their ideals are universal and can be replicated elsewhere. This seems to be too true, especially in relation to the earlier mentioned Arab Spring, which has later metamorphosed into an \u2018Arab Winter\u2019 of social and ethnic conflicts.\nGlobalisation and greater interconnectedness also bring economic aspects of free-market capitalism and industrialisation around the world. This has facilitated greater free-trade, increased capital flows, increased transport and communication, and the growth of multi-national companies (MNCs). One example of how these have brought more stability, less conflict, to a country once ravaged by the ills of war is South Korea. Under the leadership of third President Park Chung Hee, South Korea shifted her focus from self-sufficiency in the Syngman Rhee\u2019s administration to export-oriented industrialisation. This facilitated the rise of multinational conglomerates such as Hyundai in heavy industries and motors, and Samsung in electronics and shipbuilding. To facilitate the above operations, infrastructures and communications were improved. As a result, a once socially instable and poverty-ridden post-war South Korea transformed into a wealthy, developed and socially stable nation in a span of four decades. The \u2018Miracle on the Han River\u2019 is a testament that globalisation and greater interconnectedness have allowed nations to experience less evils, hence conflict, compared to what would have been in the past.\nOn the contrary, the same economic aspects have ironically brought scourge to other parts of the world. There was an initial belief that Congo, which holds more than 80% of the world\u2019s coltan reserves, would benefit socio-economically from the rise in demand of consumer electronics starting from the late 1990s. This is because coltan is a raw material used to produce tantalum in capacitors, a critical component in manufacturing computers and smart devices.  However, the digital revolution proved to be more of a bane than a boon. Warring rebel forces attack villages and displace families to mine and supply coltan in response to demand from MNCs. This finances their ensuing civil war. Even neighbouring Rwanda has joined in the pillaging to exploit the coltan reserves. As a consequence, more than a few million civilians have perished. This shows that when nations have weak governance and polarized societies, there are rendered unfit to best take advantage of too widespread a phenomena as globalization. In these cases, civil unrest, and conflict results.\nUltimately, our transition into an age of \u2018late-modernity\u2019 has been indubitable a multi-faceted and complex process. Globalisation and interconnectedness will likely remain an irreversible trend, but gloablisation can simultaneously bring more and less conflict. This largely depends on political, cultural, and historical climates of the geographical \u2018places\u2019 in which the related events occur. However, what remains important is that humanity continues to learn from her circumstances, and face them to construct a better age. This is through both the conflicts which globalisation has promoted in certain places such as the Middle East, Hong Kong and Congo; and the good it has done to other nations like South Korea.",

This increased awareness can help to reduce prejudice and promote greater mutual respect and understanding. For example, social media platforms allow people from different parts of the world to engage in conversations and share insights on various issues, leading to greater cross-cultural understanding.\n\nAnother positive aspect of globalisation is the growth of global governance institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, which provide a forum for nations to collaborate and resolve conflicts peacefully. These institutions help to ensure that disputes are resolved through diplomacy and negotiation rather than violence. Additionally, globalisation has led to the creation of regional organizations, such as the European Union, which have played a vital role in promoting greater regional stability and cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has also resulted in the spread of democratic values and principles. As more countries adopt democratic systems of government, they become more accountable to their citizens and are less likely to engage in conflict with their neighbours. Democracies tend to be more stable, peaceful, and prosperous than authoritarian regimes, as they provide greater political stability and economic opportunities for their citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has brought about some conflicts, it has also contributed to promoting greater understanding and cooperation among nations. It has encouraged the growth of global institutions that foster diplomacy and negotiation, and the spread of democratic values and principles that promote stability and prosperity.

In these circumstances, globalisation can act as a positive force for peace and unity.\n\nFinally, it is important to turn to the economic impacts of globalisation. Global business activities have created unprecedented levels of global trade, investment, and cross-border production. The reduction in trade barriers and tariffs have led to the emergence of a \u2018global economy\u2019. Countries can import and export goods and services more freely, leading to specialization in production and lower prices for consumers. This has led to widespread economic growth and development. As business opportunities have flourished, many developing countries have grown faster in this phase of globalisation, finally enjoying a standard of living that they had been denied. For example, Chinese technology company Huawei, which was founded in 1987, is today the world's second-largest manufacturer of smartphones owing to its global outreach. Similarly, Indian IT companies like Infosys and Wipro have grown to become global giants today, providing much-needed employment to millions of India's youth.\n\nTo conclude, it is evident that globalisation can either promote peace or conflict. It has created new opportunities for economic growth, cross-cultural understanding, and technological innovation. However, it also poses new challenges, such as the spread of extremist propaganda and the emergence of new forms of conflict and warfare.

This has brought economic opportunities to many nations, some of which have experienced significant economic growth, such as China and India. However, the flip side of this process is that many low-skilled jobs have been outsourced to nations with weaker labour laws and lower wages, leading to job losses in developed nations and exploitation of workers in developing nations. Wealth and income inequality has also been exacerbated, with the richest 1% of the world owning more wealth than the bottom 50%. This has sparked discontent and protests, such as the Occupy Wall Street movement in the USA, and the gilets jaunes protests in France. The resulting political instability can potentially lead to further conflict and unrest.\nIn conclusion, globalisation has both positive and negative effects on conflict. While it has facilitated greater communication and cultural exchange, leading to better understanding between nations, it has also facilitated the spread of conflict beyond national borders and has created greater wealth and income inequality. Ultimately, the extent of conflict arising from globalisation depends on the manner in which it is managed and harnessed to bring about a more peaceful and equitable global society.",

                "relations and understanding, particularly as it becomes more prevalent globally.\nFurthermore, globalisation has wrought an immense amount of wealth and growth in the global economy. With the advent of transnational corporations, international trade and technological improvements, many are experiencing higher standards of living due to higher purchasing power arising from economic growth. China\u2019s remarkable transformation from an insular communist country to a global powerhouse has been largely due to the ruling party\u2019s embracing of market forces and globalisation principles. Many argue that globalisation, by virtue of global wealth generation and the reduction in poverty rates, has led to the prevention of conflict. Thomas Friedman, in his book \u2018The Lexus and the Olive Tree,\u2019 argues that the globalisation process has allowed for the establishment of a \u201cmutually assured development\u201d achieved through commercial ties and investments between nations, negating the need for inter-nation conflicts.\nHowever, while these growth and redistribution effects of globalisation may be indicative of positive conflict outcomes, it is important to recognise that the global economy is ultimately powered by the increasingly unequal share of resources and wealth. Several macroeconomic indicators around the world continue to demonstrate that global income inequality remains a significant issue: indeed, the richest 1% of people own more than half of the world\u2019s wealth as of 2017. By exacerbating the income and wealth divide, heightened by the current Covid-19 pandemic, globalisation can paradoxically become a cause of conflict and tension, especially between corporations, local communities, and state actors as corporations engage in exploitation of resources or polluting activities. This has been exemplified by the numerous environmental protests against multinational corporations in the construct of the Dakota Max Access pipeline, or the anti-globalisation anti-capitalist protests across Europe in 1999.\nIn conclusion, the effects of globalisation on conflict are diverse and multifaceted. While globalisation processes have enabled better understanding, increased interdependence, and greater formation of positive ties through cultural and economic cooperation, they have also brought about unintended consequences in the forms of political and economic inequality and extremist ideologies. Hence, achieving sustainable conflict outcomes in a globalised world will require proactive diplomatic efforts and balanced socio-economic development to harness globalisation as a means of promoting progress and interdependence, while mitigating against potential negative consequences.",

The proliferation of de-territorialising technologies has created opportunities for positive change, but has also fostered conflict. Greater awareness and understanding of diverse cultures has given rise to unprecedented levels of interconnectivity and interdependence. While there is no clear consensus on whether globalisation has caused or prevented conflict, it is clear that the forces of globalisation are here to stay.

This commercial interconnectedness has been one of the main drivers of globalisation, breaking down barriers between nations to allow for greater cross-border flows of capital, goods and labour. While this has resulted in significant economic growth and development, it has also given rise to issues of inequality within and between countries. For example, the rising income inequality within developed economies like the United States has created discontent amongst the working class, who often feel that their jobs are being outsourced to developing economies like China and India. This has subsequently led to increased protectionism against trade policies, as seen in the case of the United States\u2019 tariff wars against China and other countries. Nevertheless, the process of globalisation has also resulted in developing economies being able to access the global market, thereby creating numerous opportunities for developing countries to improve their standards of living. \n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has indeed brought about significant benefits in terms of socio-cultural exchange, economic growth and development, it is not possible to conclusively argue that the process has prevented more conflict than it has caused. The effects of globalisation are indeed highly nuanced and varied, and much depends on the specific contexts and issues, thereby requiring policymakers to adopt a more nuanced and multi-faceted approach towards the phenomenon. Ultimately, what is most important is that we continue to engage in dialogue and debate on the impact and implications of globalisation, to fully understand its complexities and to ensure that we harness the benefits and address the challenges that come with it.",

Because of the ease of conducting business across borders, foreign companies have been able to penetrate local markets, and local companies able to go global, deepening economic ties. The globalisation of industries has not only brought about economic growth, it has also facilitated technological innovation and research and development. The availability of labour, capital, and other resources are maximised when globalisation interconnects different regions, industries, and sectors of businesses. The concept of comparative advantage, which states that a country should produce goods for which it has the lowest opportunity cost and import goods for which it has the highest opportunity cost, has been an important economic principle to help developing countries benefit from globalisation. However, as we saw during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, globalisation can also debilitate economies through overdependence on foreign markets, financial imbalances and speculative bubbles. In addition, in smaller economies such as Singapore, the influx of foreign workers can exacerbate social tensions and labour conflicts. \n\nIn conclusion, globalisation has impacted our political, socio-cultural and economic spheres in profound ways. While the blurring of lines between local and global, and the rapid spread of information and ideas, have resulted in a high degree of cultural exchange and economic growth, it has also brought about conflicts and tensions that are at once local and global. It is vital to balance these benefits and drawbacks of globalisation, and to develop policies that effectively mitigate conflicts and promote positive integration.

The global spread of information and the increasing interconnectedness of our world have led to greater awareness of differing cultures and political systems. However, it has also facilitated the spread of radicalism and extremism. It is thus important for us to remember that while we should embrace the positive changes and benefits that globalisation can bring, we must also be vigilant against its dangers and negative consequences.

The extensive development of infrastructure such as airports, shipping ports and railways has facilitated the movement of products and services, resulting in increased competition among businesses and often lowering prices, hence benefiting consumers. For example, the widespread adoption of information technology has allowed businesses to operate across borders and accessible from anywhere around the world. This technology has allowed even small firms to obtain market access overseas. As a result of increased competition, consumers benefit from lower prices and more choices \u2013 a prime example being the many online shopping sites such as Amazon, eBay and Alibaba.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that globalisation has not entirely prevented or caused conflicts. Rather, the extent to which it facilitates conflict or cooperation seems to depend on how different parties harness the opportunities of globalisation in a more positive or negative sense. Nonetheless, it is important to recognise that globalisation has brought great benefits to human development in general and we should therefore strive to capitalize on its positive implications to build a more sustainable and peaceful world."

Through these organisations, nations have come together to address issues such as poverty, climate change, and humanitarian crises, reducing the risk of conflict and promoting peace.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has indeed brought about conflicts and tensions among different nations and cultures, it has also helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding. By increasing communication and collaboration between countries and promoting shared values and goals, globalisation provides the means for people to work together to solve problems and create a better world for all. As we move forward in this interconnected world, it is important to recognise and embrace the opportunities that globalisation presents, while working to mitigate its negative effects.",
                "and communication between different nations and cultures. This has allowed people from different backgrounds to better understand and appreciate one another's perspectives, leading to a greater sense of empathy and tolerance. For example, the growth of social media platforms and other online communication tools has allowed people from all over the world to connect and share ideas, leading to greater cultural exchange and understanding.\n\nGlobalisation has also led to the development of international frameworks and institutions aimed at promoting peace and cooperation. The creation of the United Nations, for example, has provided a platform for countries to discuss and resolve conflicts through diplomatic channels. Similarly, the World Trade Organisation has helped to create rules-based systems for international trade, reducing tensions and disputes between nations.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has certainly brought about increased conflict in some aspects, it has also helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding among nations. As we move forward, it is important that we continue to acknowledge and address the challenges and tensions that come with increased connectivity and interdependence, while also recognising the potential for globalisation to be a force for peace and cooperation.",
                "and ideas between nations, which has led to greater understanding and empathy among people from different cultures. With the rise of social media and other communication technologies, individuals from around the world can now easily connect and share their opinions and experiences. This increased connectivity has led to greater social awareness and activism for causes that affect people across borders, such as climate change, human rights, and gender equality.\n\nAnother way in which globalisation has helped to reduce conflicts is through increased trade and economic cooperation. The growth of international trade has led to greater economic interdependence between nations, which in turn has created incentives for countries to resolve conflicts peacefully rather than resorting to military action. Additionally, when countries are economically interconnected, they are more likely to engage in diplomatic and political dialogue, which helps to build bridges and foster a sense of trust and cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has indeed brought about conflicts and tensions in some areas, overall, it has helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding among nations. As globalisation continues to evolve and shape the world in new ways, it is important for individuals and governments to work together to harness its potential for positive change while mitigating its negative impacts. By doing so, we can build a more peaceful, just, and prosperous world for all.",
                "and knowledge across borders, facilitating communication and understanding between different cultures. This has helped to break down barriers and stereotypes, and promote greater empathy and tolerance towards other societies. In addition, globalisation has led to the spread of democratic values and human rights, as well as the growth of international institutions that promote peace and cooperation among nations. Examples of such institutions include the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the International Criminal Court.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has helped to create a more interconnected world where nations rely on each other for trade, investment, and security. This interdependence has created incentives for nations to cooperate and resolve conflicts peacefully, rather than resort to violence. For example, economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure have been used to resolve conflicts between nations, such as the nuclear crisis in Iran and the ongoing conflict in Syria.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly drawbacks to globalisation, such as increased economic competition and cultural clashes, overall, it has helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding among nations. Through increased information flow, democratic values, and international institutions, globalisation has created a more interconnected and cooperative world, where nations have incentives to work together for mutual benefit and sustainability. As such, we should continue to embrace globalisation while being mindful of its challenges, in order to create a more peaceful and prosperous world.",
                "and communication between countries, leading to greater understanding and cooperation. As countries become more connected, they are able to work together to address global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and terrorism. For example, the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change was a result of international cooperation and understanding, bringing together nations with different priorities to address a common challenge.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has also helped to reduce conflicts by increasing trade and economic interdependence between nations. This has made it less likely for countries to go to war with each other, as a result of the potentially disastrous economic consequences. For example, the establishment of the European Union has created a strong economic bond between European countries, reducing tensions that were once common between neighbouring countries.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has undoubtedly led to conflicts and tensions in some aspects, it is important to recognise its potential to promote greater understanding and reduce conflicts in the long term. As globalisation continues to evolve in the 21st century, it is up to us to work together to ensure that it benefits all citizens and promotes peace and prosperity around the world.",
                "and communication between nations. The internet and social media have made it easier for people to connect with others from different countries and cultures, allowing for greater understanding and cooperation. Additionally, the growth of international institutions and agreements, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, have provided a platform for nations to come together and resolve conflicts peacefully.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has led to increased economic prosperity and a higher standard of living for many people around the world. This has reduced the incentive for conflict, as countries are less likely to go to war when their populations are economically secure. In fact, research has shown that countries with higher levels of economic interdependence are less likely to engage in armed conflict with each other.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has certainly brought about conflicts and tensions, it has also brought people and nations closer together than ever before. The benefits of increased understanding, cooperation, and prosperity outweigh the negative aspects of economic competition and cultural clashes. In order for globalisation to continue to promote peace and stability in the world, it is important for nations to work together and build on the positive aspects of this phenomenon.",

As people from different cultures come into contact with one another, they are able to learn about each other's customs and beliefs, fostering empathy and respect. This has led to greater cultural exchange, as well as increased collaboration on issues such as environmental protection, public health, and economic development.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has facilitated the creation of international organisations and agreements that promote peace and stability. Institutions such as the United Nations, World Bank, and International Monetary Fund work to coordinate global efforts towards common goals such as poverty reduction, disaster relief, and conflict resolution. Similarly, trade agreements such as the World Trade Organisation have helped to reduce conflict by establishing rules and regulations for international trade, reducing the likelihood of disputes between nations.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has brought about some conflicts and tensions, it has overall helped to reduce conflict and promote greater understanding among nations. Economic competition and cultural differences will always exist, but it is important to remember that globalisation has increased opportunities for cooperation and collaboration. By continuing to work towards greater integration and understanding, we can ensure that globalisation continues to be a force for positive change in the world.",

Furthermore, the increased economic interdependence that comes from globalisation has created greater incentives for nations to cooperate and avoid conflict. For instance, trade agreements such as the European Union have helped to promote economic cooperation and reduce the likelihood of conflict between member states.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has indeed brought about conflicts and tensions, especially in the realm of economic competition and cultural diffusion, it has also promoted greater understanding and cooperation among nations. As such, it is important to recognise that while the negative aspects of globalisation must be addressed, it remains a powerful force for peace and prosperity in the world.",

Through social media platforms, news outlets, and other forms of communication, people from different parts of the world can learn about each other's cultures, traditions, and perspectives. This can help to break down stereotypes and prejudices that fuel conflict and promote greater empathy and respect between nations.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has also led to the formation of international institutions and agreements which seek to promote cooperation and peace among nations. For example, the United Nations was created to serve as a forum for countries to address common challenges and resolve disputes peacefully. The World Trade Organization was established to regulate international trade and prevent disputes between countries from escalating into full-blown conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has undoubtedly led to increased conflict in certain areas, it has also helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding and cooperation among nations.

Through increased communication channels, individuals are exposed to diverse perspectives and worldviews, which can help to reduce stereotypes and prejudices. In addition, the increased connectivity between nations has given rise to international organisations and agreements that promote peace, such as the United Nations and various international treaties.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has helped to foster economic interdependence between nations, which can reduce the likelihood of conflict. When nations are dependent on each other for goods and services, they have a vested interest in maintaining good relations and avoiding conflict. This is exemplified by the European Union, which was formed in part to promote economic cooperation and prevent further wars between member nations.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has certainly brought about conflicts and tensions, it has also led to greater understanding and cooperation between nations. It is important to recognise both the positive and negative aspects of globalisation, and to work towards maximising its benefits while minimising its drawbacks. By doing so, we can create a more peaceful and prosperous world for all."
