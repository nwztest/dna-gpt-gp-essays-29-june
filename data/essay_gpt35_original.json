                "prompt": "IS COMPETITION ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE EDUCATION? DISCUSS.",
                "response": "Competition has always been considered a cornerstone of education. It is often believed that competition is critical for effective learning and development of students. However, there are valid arguments both in favour and against this premise. In this essay, I will discuss whether competition is essential for effective education.\n\nFirstly, competition can be beneficial for motivating students to work harder. When students compete with one another, it can push them to achieve better grades, work harder on assignments and push them out of their comfort zones. For example, a student competing in a math competition may be more motivated to study for it and to solve more complex problems than someone who is not preparing for the same contest.\n\nSecondly, competition can also prepare students for the real world. The workforce is highly competitive, and it is essential for students to know how to compete for jobs and promotions. Education is more than just academic knowledge. Students must learn critical life skills, including how to market themselves in front of employers and how to network to advance their careers.\n\nOn the other hand, competition can also lead to negative outcomes. Students who don't win may develop low self-esteem, lose their interest in learning, and may even cheat to win at all costs. Furthermore, competition can also create an unhealthy environment, where students focus solely on winning rather than learning for learning's sake.\n\nMoreover, competition may disadvantage some individuals who have not had the necessary resources or opportunities to develop their skills. For instance, students from poor socioeconomic backgrounds may have fewer resources available to them, thereby putting them at an unfair disadvantage when competing with students from more affluent families.\n\nIn conclusion, while competition can be beneficial for motivating students to work harder and prepare them for the real world, it can also create an unhealthy environment and disadvantage some individuals. It is essential to create an education system that promotes a balance between collaboration and competition. A system that promotes healthy competition to improve student learning without putting some individuals at a disadvantage is the way forward."

                "prompt": "DISCUSS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVISM.",
                "response": "Social media activism refers to the use of social media platforms to raise awareness and advocate for various social, political, and environmental issues around the world. While some argue that social media activism is an effective way to bring about change, others are skeptical about its impact. This essay will examine the effectiveness of social media activism by analyzing its strengths and limitations.\n\nThe first advantage of social media activism is its ability to reach large audiences quickly. Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have millions of users, making it possible to disseminate information and mobilize people easily. For instance, the #MeToo campaign, launched on Twitter in 2017, quickly became viral and created a massive movement against sexual harassment and assault. This campaign has resulted in changes in laws and policies in several countries, making it an effective tool for initiating change.\n\nMoreover, social media activism is cost-effective as it does not require a significant financial investment. Campaigns can be launched using hashtags, social media posts, and videos, which are cheap and accessible. This low cost makes it easier for grassroots organizations, individuals, and marginalized groups to participate and amplify their voices, bringing attention to issues that may have otherwise gone unnoticed.\n\nHowever, social media activism is not without its limitations. One notable drawback is the spread of misinformation and fake news, which can be easily shared among users and cause confusion and panic. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, social media was filled with conspiracy theories, creating panic and confusion among the public. This shows that social media can sometimes be counterproductive and even harmful.\n\nAdditionally, while social media activism spreads awareness, it may not necessarily result in actual change. While it can mobilize people to participate in protests or sign petitions, it does not necessarily translate to policy or legislative changes. Therefore, it is crucial to not only raise awareness on these issues but also to work toward creating tangible solutions.\n\nIn conclusion, social media activism is a powerful tool for bringing about social change due to its wide reach and cost-effectiveness. However, its effectiveness is limited by the spread of misinformation and the lack of actual change it can bring. To ensure that social media activism is effective, it is crucial to fact-check and verify information shared and work towards developing policies that bring about actual change."

                "prompt": "\"IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY, BE.\" DOES HAPPINESS SEEM MORE ELUSIVE IN TODAY\"S WORLD?",
                "response": "Happiness is a subjective feeling that can be easily influenced by external factors. In today's fast-paced and highly competitive world, happiness seems to be a more elusive dream than ever before. However, whether happiness seems more elusive today is a matter of personal perception. In this essay, I will elaborate on why happiness can seem more elusive in today's world, provide examples to support this claim and link it to the importance of cultivating a positive mindset.\n\nTo begin with, one of the reasons why happiness can seem more elusive in today's world is the constant pressure to succeed. In modern times, one is expected to achieve great things in their career, education, and personal life. With the rise of social media, people are comparing themselves to others more often, leading to feelings of inadequacy and unhappiness. Furthermore, advancements in technology have made our life faster but also more stressful, leaving less time for personal growth and relaxation.\n\nFor instance, a student in today's world is expected to excel academically, participate in extracurricular activities, and maintain an active social life. They are also exposed to social media platforms where their peers showcase their achievements, leading to unreasonable expectations and feelings of inadequacy. This overload of expectations results in stress, anxiety, and depression, making happiness an elusive dream.\n\nMoreover, the increasing gap between the rich and the poor is another reason why happiness seems more elusive in today's world. Wealth and material possessions have become the primary measure of success, creating a strong emphasis on materialistic values. Consequently, those who cannot afford expensive things feel left out and unhappy. Furthermore, access to social and economic resources is often directly linked to happiness. This creates a vicious cycle where those who are already disadvantaged are further deprived of happiness.\n\nFor example, people in lower socio-economic backgrounds may have limited access to resources, education, and opportunities. This can lead to a feeling of hopelessness and decrease their chances of achieving happiness, leading to a cycle of negativity.\n\nIn conclusion, although it appears that happiness is more elusive in today's world, it is important to understand that happiness is an inner state of being that does not depend on external factors. Cultivating a positive mindset, practicing gratitude, and limiting comparison to others are just some of the many ways one can improve their happiness levels. In essence, \"If you want to be happy, be\" is a statement that emphasizes the power of the individual to choose their state of mind and determine their level of happiness."

                "prompt": "\"THE PURSUIT OF THE ARTS IS NOT AN OPTION BUT AN INTEGRAL PART TO THE GROWTH OF PEOPLE.\" DISCUSS.",
                "response": "The arts have long been an important form of human expression throughout history. From ancient cave drawings to modern-day masterpieces, art has served as a medium for people to communicate, explore and reflect upon their experiences and emotions. In this essay, I will discuss why the pursuit of the arts is not an option, but an integral part of growth for individuals.\n\nFirstly, the pursuit of the arts helps individuals to develop their creativity and imagination. Through art, individuals are able to express themselves in unique and personal ways. This not only enhances their creativity but also improves their problem-solving abilities. For example, when painting a picture or composing a piece of music, one may face challenges that require creative solutions. This type of problem-solving skill can then be translated into other areas of life, such as career or personal relationships.\n\nMoreover, participating in the arts allows individuals to develop their communication and interpersonal skills. Artistic pursuits often require collaboration with others in order to bring a vision to life. This interaction with others helps to build communication and teamwork skills. For example, participating in a theatre production involves working with a cast and crew to create a performance that effectively communicates the intended message to the audience.\n\nIn addition, the arts provide a means for individuals to explore and understand the world around them. Art is often used as a means of social or political commentary. Through this lens, individuals are able to gain a deeper understanding of the society and culture they are a part of. For example, reading an award-winning novel or watching an impactful film can help us to better understand the experiences of others that may differ from our own.\n\nFinally, participation in the arts has been shown to have numerous benefits for mental health and emotional wellbeing. Art can serve as a therapeutic outlet to release stress, anxiety, and other emotions. This can lead to improved mental health outcomes and provide a sense of meaning and purpose. Participating in the arts has been shown to reduce stress levels and anxiety, as well as improve self-esteem and promote relaxation.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the arts is not simply an option, but an integral part of personal growth. The benefits of participation in the arts are numerous, including the development of creativity, teamwork and communication skills, greater understanding and empathy of the world, and improvements in mental health and emotional wellbeing. It is important for individuals to embrace and pursue the arts throughout their lives to achieve a sense of holistic growth and self-exploration."

                "prompt": "ARE PEOPLE MORE WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES TODAY?",
                "response": "In today's society, people are faced with numerous challenges that require them to make tough decisions and sacrifices. The question that arises is whether people are more willing to make sacrifices today than in the past. In my opinion, people are more willing to make sacrifices today, and this can be attributed to the changing nature of society and the emergence of new values and priorities.\n\nFirstly, people today are more aware of the impact their actions have on the environment and the community. The growing concerns about climate change and social inequality have led many individuals to adopt a more conscientious approach towards their consumption habits and lifestyle choices. For example, many people are now willing to sacrifice convenience and comfort for the greater good, by reducing their carbon footprint, donating to charity or volunteering their time and resources for social causes.\n\nSecondly, the rise of social media and the internet has enabled people to connect with others from different cultures and backgrounds, providing them with a global perspective and a more inclusive worldview. This has led to the emergence of new values and priorities, such as social justice, equality, and diversity, which have prompted many individuals to take action and make sacrifices to promote these causes. For instance, many people are now willing to give up their time and resources to support marginalized groups and advocate for their rights.\n\nLastly, the growing awareness of mental health issues and the importance of wellness has encouraged people to prioritize their own well-being and make necessary sacrifices to maintain it. For example, many individuals are now willing to sacrifice their work hours or career ambitions to prioritize their mental health, family, and relationships. This has led to a shift in priorities, where people are more inclined to prioritize their personal lives over their professional careers.\n\nIn conclusion, people today are more willing to make sacrifices due to the changing nature of society, the emergence of new values and priorities, and the global interconnectedness enabled by social media and the internet. This trend is likely to continue as people become more aware of the impact their actions have on the environment and the community, and as new challenges and opportunities arise in an ever-changing world."

                "prompt": "DISCUSS WHETHER THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF EVERYONE SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE?",
                "response": "The idea of everyone speaking the same language is not a new one, but it is an idea that continues to generate debate and discussion. While there are certainly benefits to a world in which everyone speaks the same language, there are also drawbacks to consider. In this essay, we will explore both sides of this argument.\n\nOn the one hand, a world in which everyone speaks the same language could be very beneficial. For example, communication between people of different countries and cultures would be greatly improved. This could lead to more peaceful and productive relations between nations, as people would be able to understand each other better and work together more effectively. Additionally, travel and trade would be made easier, as there would be no language barriers to complicate business deals or tourist interactions. This could lead to greater economic and cultural exchange, which in turn could benefit everyone involved.\n\nHowever, there are also some downsides to a world in which everyone speaks the same language. One potential issue is the loss of cultural and linguistic diversity. Language is a significant part of our cultural heritage, and if everyone were to speak the same language, many unique and distinct cultures and traditions could be lost. Additionally, there is the concern that a single, dominant language could be used as a tool of power and control. In a world where a single culture and language prevails, the dominant group could use this advantage to dominate and suppress other groups who do not share their language and culture. This could lead to conflict, inequality, and social unrest.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of a world in which everyone speaks the same language is a complex one, with both benefits and drawbacks. It is clear that a shared global language could lead to greater communication, cooperation, and economic exchange between nations. However, there are also concerns about a loss of cultural diversity and the potential for linguistic domination. Ultimately, it is up to each individual and society as a whole to weigh these pros and cons and determine what kind of world they want to live in."

                "prompt": "IS THIS PACE OF LIFE IN YOUR SOCIETY TOO FAST FOR ITS OWN GOOD?",
                "response": "Nowadays, many people feel that the pace of life in our society is too fast for its own good. While some may argue that life moves at a normal pace, the majority of us can attest to the fact that we are constantly rushing from task to task. In this essay, I will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon and the potential negative consequences that we face.\n\nFirstly, the rapid growth of technology has undoubtedly contributed to the fast pace of life in our society. With the advent of smartphones and social media, we are constantly bombarded with notifications and updates which leave us feeling anxious if we do not attend to them immediately. This has created an expectation of instant gratification, where everything needs to be done quickly and efficiently.\n\nFurthermore, the increasing demands of work and school have also worsened the situation. Companies and educational institutions expect employees and students to work longer hours and complete tasks at a quicker pace. This means that individuals are pressured into juggling multiple responsibilities while sacrificing their personal time and well-being.\n\nIn addition, the emphasis on productivity and achievement has led to a culture of hyper-competitiveness where individuals are in a constant rat race to score better grades or achieve higher positions. This has resulted in a society where people work longer hours and are less likely to engage in leisure activities or take care of themselves.\n\nThe consequences of this fast-paced lifestyle can be severe. Firstly, it can lead to burnout and physical and mental exhaustion. Individuals who are constantly on the go without taking a break are more likely to suffer from stress-related illnesses such as anxiety and depression. Secondly, relationships suffer, as individuals lack the time to invest in developing and maintaining meaningful connections with others.\n\nLastly, productivity may actually decrease as individuals become easily distracted and unable to focus on one task for extended periods of time. This can result in unnecessary mistakes and a longer time taken to complete tasks.\n\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that the fast pace of life is synonymous with progress, it is important to recognise the negative consequences that arise from such a lifestyle. To mitigate these effects, we must learn to prioritise our mental and physical well-being, create healthier boundaries between work and personal life, and actively seek ways to cultivate meaningful relationships that enrich our lives."

                "prompt": "DO AWARDS AND PRIZES SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE?",
                "response": "Awards and prizes are often given to individuals or groups for their exceptional efforts or accomplishments. While some may argue that awards and prizes serve no useful purpose, I believe they do in fact serve a valuable function.\n\nFirstly, awards and prizes recognize and reward achievements. They provide a tangible token of appreciation and acknowledgement for the hard work and dedication put in by individuals or groups. For instance, the Nobel Prize is awarded to individuals who have made outstanding contributions to the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace, recognizing their efforts and contributions to society.\n\nMoreover, awards and prizes serve as motivation for individuals and groups to strive for excellence. They set benchmarks and goals for people to reach, and the recognition and prestige that come with winning such accolades can inspire others to try harder and aim higher. For example, the prestigious Olympic gold medal not only recognizes the individual's outstanding performance but also motivates others to excel in their respective sports.\n\nAdditionally, awards and prizes can have a positive impact on the individual or group's career or reputation. Winning a prestigious award can enhance their credibility and open doors to new opportunities, such as funding, research grants, or job offers. This can ultimately lead to further achievements and contributions, benefiting not only the individual but also society as a whole.\n\nHowever, one must also recognize that awards and prizes can sometimes lead to negative consequences, such as a hyperfocus on winning and a disregard for the process and journey. Therefore, it is important to strike a balance between recognizing achievements and valuing the hard work and dedication that led to them.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that awards and prizes serve a useful purpose in recognizing and rewarding exceptional achievements, motivating individuals and groups to strive for excellence, and enhancing career or reputational opportunities. When used effectively, awards and prizes can inspire and benefit society as a whole."

                "prompt": "IS COURAGE NECESSARILY A VIRTUE?",
                "response": "Courage is often considered to be a virtue - a quality to be admired and emulated by others. However, whether courage is always a virtue or not is a matter of debate. On one hand, it can be argued that courage is always a virtuous act, as it involves facing one's fears and taking action despite the risks. On the other hand, it can be argued that courage is not always a virtue, as it can be used for immoral purposes or be based on faulty reasoning. Thus, the question of whether courage is necessarily a virtue is a complex one.\n\nFirstly, it can be argued that courage is always a virtue because it involves standing up for what one believes in and taking action despite the risks. For example, a firefighter who rushes into a burning building to save someone's life acts courageously, and his actions are often lauded as virtuous. Similarly, a soldier who risks his life to defend his country and its citizens is often seen as heroic and virtuous. In such cases, courage is clearly a virtue as it involves acting in accordance with one's moral principles in the face of danger.\n\nHowever, it can also be argued that courage is not always a virtue, as it can be used to justify immoral actions. For example, a person who commits a terrorist act in the name of a cause may see their actions as courageous, but they are not necessarily virtuous. Similarly, a person who starts a fight to defend their ego may see themselves as courageous, but their actions are not morally justified. In such cases, courage may be used to justify actions that are harmful or immoral.\n\nMoreover, the reasoning behind an act of courage can also affect its status as a virtue. If a person acts courageously out of a sense of duty or compassion, their actions are likely to be seen as virtuous. On the other hand, if a person acts courageously out of a desire for fame or recognition, their actions may not be seen as virtuous. Thus, the motivation behind an act of courage is an important consideration when evaluating its status as a virtue.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of whether courage is necessarily a virtue is a complex one. While courage can be seen as virtuous when it involves standing up for what one believes in and taking action despite the risks, it may not be virtuous if it is used to justify immoral actions or based on faulty reasoning. Ultimately, the moral reasoning behind an act of courage is an important factor in determining its status as a virtue."

                "response": "As an avid reader and a student of literature, I completely disagree with the notion that reading novels is a waste of time. In fact, reading novels is not only an enjoyable pastime but it also has several benefits.\n\nFirst and foremost, reading novels can help to improve one\u2019s language and vocabulary. Novels are generally written using more sophisticated language than that used in everyday conversation and reading novels can help to expand one\u2019s vocabulary and improve their language skills.\n\nFurthermore, reading novels can help to develop one's empathy and understanding of others. Novels often have complex and well-developed characters, and readers can gain an insight into their motivations, thoughts and emotions. This can help to develop empathy towards others and provide an insight into the complexities of human nature.\n\nIn addition, reading novels can act as a stress reliever and provide a mental escape from the pressures of everyday life. It can transport readers to different worlds and experiences, providing a therapeutic effect on the mind.\n\nFurthermore, reading novels can stimulate the imagination and enhance creativity. Novelists often describe vivid scenes and characters, and readers can use their imagination to create mental pictures of these descriptions. This helps to stimulate the creative faculties of the mind.\n\nMoreover, reading novels can be a valuable source of knowledge and information. Novels often explore social, historical and political contexts and can provide readers with an understanding of different cultures and worldviews. \n\nIn conclusion, novels offer a plethora of benefits and are not a waste of time. Reading novels can improve language skills, develop empathy, act as a stress-reliever, stimulate imagination and enhance creativity, and be a valuable source of knowledge and information. Thus, reading novels should be encouraged and valued for the myriad ways in which it contributes to personal growth."

                "prompt": "\"A SCHOOL SHOULD NOT ONLY TEACH KNOWLEDGE, BUT VALUES AS WELL.\" DISCUSS.",
                "response": "Education is not just about acquiring knowledge, but it also involves the cultivation of values and virtues that play a vital role in shaping an individual\u2019s character. Hence, schools should not only focus on imparting knowledge but also on instilling values in their students, which will help them become responsible and ethical individuals.\n\nFirstly, schools should teach values such as honesty, integrity, and respect, which are essential for a person\u2019s growth and development. Honesty, for instance, is a valuable trait that teaches individuals to speak the truth and do the right thing, even when no one is watching. Integrity is another important value that signifies moral uprightness and the ability to be true to oneself. Respect, on the other hand, teaches individuals to treat others with politeness and dignity, regardless of their age, gender, or socio-economic status. By inculcating such values, schools lay the foundation for a just and harmonious society.\n\nSecondly, teaching values helps students develop a sense of social responsibility, which is crucial to becoming a conscientious citizen. Values such as kindness, empathy, and compassion help students understand the importance of caring for others and fulfilling their civic duties. When students learn to value relationships, they tend to become more compassionate towards others, and this enables them to understand the problems of others better. As a result, they tend to contribute to the well-being of others and become responsible citizens.\n\nLastly, values are instrumental in shaping an individual\u2019s moral and ethical standards. Schools should teach values such as self-discipline, diligence, and perseverance, which are essential for personal growth and development. Individuals who possess these values are more likely to excel in their careers, develop healthy relationships, and lead fulfilling lives. By inculcating such values, schools help students develop strong moral foundations, which are crucial to making important decisions in life.\n\nIn conclusion, a school that focuses only on knowledge at the expense of values cannot produce individuals who are well-rounded and responsible citizens. It is the responsibility of schools to teach values alongside knowledge to instill a sense of responsibility, develop strong moral foundations and contribute to the well-being of society. Therefore, schools should include a values-based education in their curricula as it will not only benefit the students but also the larger community."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE THAT MODERN LIFE IS PLAGUED BY FEAR AND INSECURITY?",
                "response": "In the modern world, fear and insecurity have become an increasingly pervasive issue. Whether it is the fear of physical harm, financial instability, or social isolation, individuals today are constantly battling their inner demons. In this essay, I will examine how fear and insecurity have become deeply entrenched in modern life, and argue that this phenomenon has had far-reaching consequences for individuals and society as a whole.\n\nFirstly, it is undeniable that the prevalence of violence and crime has contributed significantly to the sense of fear and insecurity that characterizes modern life. News reports of shootings, bombings, and acts of terrorism are common occurrences in many parts of the world, and even in relatively safe cities, fear of crime can be deeply ingrained in the minds of individuals. This constant fear can be debilitating and can prevent individuals from leading fulfilling lives.\n\nMoreover, the rapid pace of technological advancement has led to profound changes in the world of work, contributing further to feelings of insecurity. The rise of automation and artificial intelligence has led to the displacement of vast numbers of workers, with many individuals struggling to find meaningful employment. Additionally, the gig economy which has emerged in recent years has contributed to a sense of precariousness among workers, who lack the stability and security provided by traditional employment.\n\nFinally, the rise of social media has contributed significantly to feelings of insecurity and anxiety among individuals. The constant comparisons to others and the high expectations placed on individuals to present themselves in a certain way online can lead to a profound sense of inadequacy. This can lead to feelings of isolation and anxiety, as individuals struggle to reconcile their online persona with their actual selves.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that fear and insecurity have become deeply entrenched in modern life. Whether it is due to the prevalence of violence and crime, the rapid pace of technological advancement, or the rise of social media, individuals today are constantly battling feelings of fear and anxiety. It is essential that society works towards addressing these underlying issues, in order to create a world where individuals can lead fulfilling and happy lives."

                "response": "Parental negligence is undoubtedly one of the most significant factors contributing to rising juvenile delinquency. Juvenile delinquency refers to the illegal or immoral behaviour of minors or children below the age of 18. Parents play a crucial role in shaping their children's behaviour and guiding them through their vulnerable teenage years. However, many parents fail to fulfil their responsibilities, which leads to an increase in juvenile delinquency.\n\nFirstly, parental neglect can result in a lack of guidance and supervision of children. Parents may fail to monitor their children's activities or fail to set strict rules and boundaries for them. This lack of supervision can lead to children engaging in unlawful and immoral activities, such as drug abuse, vandalism, or even theft. A prime example is children who frequently skip school and end up getting involved in gangs or engaging in criminal activities.\n\nSecondly, parental negligence can also be manifested in terms of emotional neglect, which can have severe long-term effects on the child. Emotional neglect occurs when a parent fails to provide emotional support, including appropriate affection, understanding, and attention. Such neglect can lead to children feeling abandoned, unloved, and ignored, which can, in turn, lead to mental distress, depression, and anxiety. As a result, children might feel the need to act out, engage in delinquent behaviours, and seek attention in the wrong way.\n\nLastly, some parents fail to provide their children with a supportive environment at home. Children may exhibit delinquent behaviour due to a lack of family support or due to parents who are going through financial or marital difficulties. Such negative factors at home can lead to children having low self-esteem and poor problem-solving skills, contributing to higher rates of juvenile delinquency.\n\nIn conclusion, parental negligence, whether intentional or unintentional, is a significant contributing factor to rising juvenile delinquency. Parents must pay attention to their children, guide them through their teenage years and provide them with a supportive environment. To reduce juvenile delinquency rates, it is essential that parents take up their responsibilities and fulfil them to the best of their abilities."

                "prompt": "\"A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS ONE THAT IS ABLE TO MAKE UNPOPULAR DECISIONS.\" DISCUSS.",
                "response": "The effectiveness of a government is often dependent on its ability to make difficult decisions that may not be received well by the public. This essay seeks to explore the idea that a good government is one that is able to make unpopular decisions.\n\nTo begin with, a government that is unwilling to take tough decisions generally runs the risk of being perceived as incompetent or unreliable. It is essential that a government is able to take the necessary steps to ensure the safety and well-being of its citizens, regardless of how unpopular the decisions may be. For example, a government faced with an imminent viral pandemic should not delay taking unpopular but necessary measures, such as social distancing and lockdowns, to curb the spread of the disease and save lives.\n\nMoreover, unpopular decisions are often made with the long-term interests of the country in mind. These decisions may not provide immediate benefits, but they create positive effects in the long run. For instance, a government that has to impose strict environmental regulations that may negatively impact businesses may be unpopular in the short-term, but these actions could help to mitigate environmental damage in the future, thus securing a sustainable future for the country.\n\nAdditionally, unpopular measures can sometimes be necessary to address issues that may not be within the realm of the government's direct control. Such a decision could be the rise in the cost of essential goods due to global factors. A good government must be able to implement policies that could ameliorate the immediate impact without undermining the country's long-term economic development.\n\nHowever, where a government that continuously makes unpopular decisions without considering the interests of its citizens, it can lead to unrest and resentment among the people. Hence, a government needs to engage the citizens in decision-making processes and provide clarity about why certain unpopular decisions are made. This way, the people can trust that their leaders are working in their best interests.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be pushback against unpopular decisions made by a good government, such a government should not waiver in taking necessary actions that secure the long-term interests of the country and its citizens. It is important for governments to be transparent and communicate to their constituents about the reason behind making unpopular decisions that may be for the greater good of all."

                "prompt": "\"HOW CRUCIAL IS A SENSE OF HISTORY IN SHAPING SINGAPORE\"S FUTURE?",
                "response": "Singapore is a young country that has a brief but rich history. Its unique past has played a vital role in shaping the country and its current identity. However, how significant is a sense of history in shaping Singapore's future? In this essay, we will explore the importance of history and why it is crucial for the country's future.\n\nFirstly, history provides context and valuable insights into Singapore's past, allowing us to understand the challenges that were faced and how they were overcome. This knowledge is essential in helping us navigate current and future issues as a nation. The events of the past have shaped Singapore's society, governance system, and economy in numerous ways. For example, understanding the policies implemented by the founding fathers in the 1960s and 1970s that transformed Singapore from a third-world to a first-world country can be a source of inspiration as we grapple with current economic challenges.\n\nSecondly, without an understanding of Singapore's history, there will be a lack of national identity and collective memory. Knowing our common history and the values we collectively hold dear is crucial in maintaining social cohesion and enabling citizens to have a shared sense of purpose. Without this, future generations may forget the sacrifices and hard work of our forefathers that helped build Singapore and take our prosperity for granted.\n\nThirdly, history educates us about the mistakes of the past and helps us to avoid repeating the same mistakes in the future. Learning about the pitfalls and consequences of previous policies, such as the 'Stop at Two' campaign, can provide valuable lessons in future decision-making. By studying and learning from the past, future policymakers can avoid making mistakes that could have severe repercussions.\n\nLastly, history promotes tourism and contributes to the economy. Singapore's heritage and culture draw millions of tourists to the country each year, boosting the economy and creating job opportunities. By preserving and promoting our historical landmarks and stories, we can show the world Singapore's unique identity and attract people from different parts of the world, making the country a melting pot of cultures and ideas.\n\nIn conclusion, a sense of history is crucial in shaping Singapore's future. Understanding our past provides us with valuable insights, helps us to maintain national identity and social cohesion, educates us on past mistakes, and promotes economic growth. Only by embracing the lessons of our past can we move forward as a nation and face the challenges that the future may bring."

                "prompt": "THE POSSIBILITY OF A WORLD WAR IN THE NEAR FUTURE CAN BE ENTERTAINED. DO YOU AGREE?",
                "response": "There is no question that the world has been experiencing unrest and instability in recent years. With tensions high between major global powers, many experts fear the possibility of a world war breaking out in the near future. In my opinion, I agree that such a scenario is not impossible, and close attention must be paid to the signs that could potentially escalate into worldwide conflict.\n\nFirstly, the rise of nationalism and populism in many countries has been alarming. Many leaders today prioritise their nation's interests over global diplomacy. As a result, this creates tension between countries and can lead to disagreements, conflicts and even military action. For instance, we have seen tensions rising between the US and China regarding trade and territorial disputes. This indicates that the global environment is not conducive to maintaining peace and stability.\n\nSecondly, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is becoming an increasing threat to world peace. As countries acquire more advanced weapons, the risks of a miscalculated move increase. The possibility of a nuclear war or a chemical warfare breakout is real, and we cannot overlook the possibility of such a disaster.\n\nThirdly, cyber-attacks have the potential to disrupt global order and security. In recent years, there have been reports of hacking into public utilities such as electricity, water supply and financial systems. The potential implications of this are frightening. It could bring down entire economies and destabilise governments, leading hostile nations to take advantage of the chaos.\n\nIn conclusion, the risk of a world war cannot be completely ruled out. The geopolitical landscape is increasingly complex, and the rise of nationalism and nationalism in many countries pose threats to global peace. Further, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the possibility of cyber warfare have only added to the concerns. We can only hope that cooler heads will eventually prevail, and international diplomacy can prevent any significant conflicts from erupting."

                "prompt": "IS THERE STILL PRIVACY IN TODAY\"S WORLD ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NEED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY?",
                "response": "Privacy has long been considered a fundamental human right, but with advancements in technology and growing concerns for national security, the question remains: is there still privacy in today's world? Although national security measures have infringed on privacy to some extent, privacy does still exist in many forms.\n\nTo begin with, individuals still retain some control over their personal information. For instance, by using privacy settings on social media platforms, individuals regulate access to their posts, photos, and other activities on the networks. By doing so, they limit the number of individuals who can view their information.\n\nFurthermore, confidentiality is still maintained in certain situations such as doctor-patient privilege, attorney-client confidentiality, and the sanctity of the confessional in religious institutions. Even though national security agencies could argue that these may hinder their investigations, existing laws ensure that privacy rights endure in these instances to protect individual liberties.\n\nMoreover, technology has enabled individuals to secure their digital communication. Encryption technologies, used by messaging apps such as WhatsApp and Signal, ensure that only the sender and the recipient can view the contents of a message sent between them. This technology makes it harder for national security agencies to access users' digital liberties as they cannot rely on a third party to provide them with information regarding individuals' communication.\n\nConversely, there have been instances where privacy has been sacrificed in the name of national security. For example, the Patriot Act passed by the United States Congress after the 9/11 attacks authorized government agencies to collect and analyze vast amounts of personal data, making it a threat to privacy rights. Similarly, in Singapore, the proposed Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act could infringe on privacy rights as it would grant the government broad powers to access individuals' online activities.\n\nTo sum up, although national security measures have infringed on privacy, privacy still exists in many forms. Individuals have some control over their personal information, confidentiality is still maintained in certain situations, and technology enables digital communication to remain secure. However, privacy concerns remain, particularly as the balance between national security measures and privacy rights continues to be debated."

                "prompt": "\"FOREIGN AID DOES NOT SOLVE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.\" TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS A FAIR VIEWPOINT?",
                "response": "Foreign aid is a crucial tool of international diplomacy that empowers countries to assist others in times of need. Many argue, however, that foreign aid is an unsustainable solution to long-term problems, and that it does little to address the root causes of poverty in developing countries. While foreign aid can provide short-term relief to those in need, it may not necessarily solve long-term problems. In this essay, I will explore the extent to which this viewpoint is fair.\n\nFirstly, it is true that foreign aid can provide immediate relief to developing countries in times of need. Countries that are ravaged by war or natural disasters, for example, require immediate assistance to provide basic necessities such as food, water, and shelter for their citizens. Foreign aid can be instrumental in fulfilling these urgent needs. For example, after the 2011 tsunami in Japan, the international community provided aid in the form of food, clothing, and shelter to those in need.\n\nHowever, while foreign aid can provide short-term relief, it may not address long-term problems as effectively. One reason is that foreign aid can be ineffective in promoting sustainable development. For instance, many developing countries are plagued by corruption that siphons off foreign aid for personal gain. The money ends up in the hands of a few corrupt officials rather than being invested in sustainable infrastructure or education. Furthermore, donating money without real support for these countries to fix the root of their problems does not help develop sustainable and independent systems.\n\nAdditionally, foreign aid can create a cycle of dependence. By relying on foreign aid, developing countries may not invest in their own development, avoiding the risks that come with long-term planning and investments. Foreign aid can also stifle the growth of local industries: if a country receives free food from abroad rather than purchasing from local farmers, the local economy may suffer, as the jobs and profits that would have been created by the food industry are lost.\n\nTo conclude, while foreign aid can provide necessary short-term relief in times of need, it does not necessarily solve long-term problems. Addressing the root causes of poverty in developing countries requires investment in sustainable infrastructure, education, and local economies. While foreign aid can play a role in promoting sustainable development, it should be paired with other long-term strategies, and carefully structured to promote independence and self-sufficiency."

                "prompt": "IS PRESSURE A MOTIVATING FORCE OR A CAUSE FOR UNHAPPINESS?",
                "response": "Pressure is an inevitable part of our lives. We face pressure at home, in our social life and especially, at work or in our studies. Some people use pressure as a motivating force to push themselves to achieve greater success, while others find it overwhelming and a cause for unhappiness. In my opinion, pressure can be both a motivating force and a cause for unhappiness, depending on the individual's mindset and attitude towards it.\n\nOn one hand, pressure can serve as a powerful motivating force that spurs individuals to achieve their goals. When we are under pressure, we are more focused, driven, and determined to succeed. Consequently, we put in more effort and work harder to achieve our goals, leading to greater achievements. For instance, students who are under pressure to perform well in their exams may dedicate more time to studying, engage in active learning, and take advantage of all resources available to them to achieve their desired grades.\n\nOn the other hand, excessive pressure can be detrimental to an individual's mental health and wellbeing. When one is constantly under pressure, it can lead to stress, anxiety, and burnout, which can negatively impact one's performance and overall happiness. For example, employees who are constantly under pressure to meet tight deadlines or unrealistic targets may experience high levels of stress, leading to a decrease in productivity, poor health outcomes, and in turn, a decrease in overall job satisfaction.\n\nFurthermore, individuals who are unable to cope with pressure effectively may experience a loss of confidence, self-esteem, and motivation. This can lead to a negative spiral of poor performance, which can reinforce their fears and anxieties about the pressure they are under. For instance, a student who is unable to cope with the pressure of constant assignments, projects and exams may experience a loss of self-confidence, which can further impact their academic performance and overall happiness.\n\nIn conclusion, while pressure can act as a motivating force that drives individuals to achieve their desired goals, it can also be a source of unhappiness when it becomes excessive and unmanageable. Adopting a positive mindset and learning effective coping mechanisms can help individuals manage pressure effectively and use it as a force for motivation. Ultimately, finding the right balance between pressure and personal wellbeing is crucial to achieving success and happiness."

                "prompt": "EVALUATE THE CLAIM THAT ACHIEVING AN INCLUSIVE SOCIETY IS A DESIRABLE BUT UNREALISTIC GOAL.",
                "response": "An inclusive society is one in which everyone, regardless of their race, religion, gender, or any other characteristic, is valued and able to participate fully in society. While achieving such a society is undoubtedly desirable, some argue that it is an unrealistic goal. In this essay, I will evaluate the claim that achieving an inclusive society is a desirable but unrealistic goal.\n\nFirstly, it is desirable to create an inclusive society as it promotes social cohesion and reduces social tensions. When people feel valued and included in society, they are more likely to participate in community activities and work collaboratively towards common goals. In an inclusive society, individuals from diverse backgrounds can work together towards improving the environment and resolving public issues. This leads to a more peaceful civil society.\n\nHowever, critics may argue that achieving an inclusive society is unrealistic. They may argue that humans are inherently tribal and tend towards creating their own social circles based on shared characteristics. This means that people may find it hard to identify with people who are very different from them. This tendency to group people into \"us\" versus \"them\" can create barriers to inclusive societies.\n\nMoreover, socio-economic inequalities may hinder the creation of inclusive societies. Low-income individuals, minorities, and marginalized groups may have fewer opportunities and less access to education, resources, and social networks. This can lead to a perpetuation of poverty and marginalization, which may prevent individuals from these groups from participating fully in society.\n\nHowever, while creating an inclusive society is a challenging task, it is not necessarily an unrealistic one. With progressive policies and social programs that target marginalized communities, socio-economic inequalities can be reduced. Public education campaigns and cultural exchange programs can help reduce prejudice and promote cross-cultural understanding. Encouraging diversity and inclusion is a progressive value that is supported by many people worldwide.\n\nIn conclusion, creating an inclusive society is a desirable and noble goal that should be aimed. Although some may suggest that it is unrealistic, with necessary interventions such as social programs, public education, and cultural exchange, an inclusive society can be achieved. We must continue to strive towards creating an inclusive society where everyone is valued and able to participate fully in society."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT IS SPORTING ACHIEVEMENT GIVEN ADEQUATE RECOGNITION IN YOUR SOCIETY?",
                "response": "Sporting achievement is often considered as a symbol of national pride and a source of inspiration for many. Nevertheless, the question of whether sporting achievement is given adequate recognition in my society remains a debatable issue. In my opinion, while sports have gained greater attention in the recent years, there are still aspects to be improved.\n\nTo begin, Singapore has been encouraging greater participation in sports through various initiatives and incentives. For example, the government has allocated millions of dollars for the construction of state-of-the-art sports facilities such as the Sports Hub and the Singapore Sports School. Additionally, schools have been actively promoting sports and providing better support for training and development, often leading to greater representation in competitive leagues. Furthermore, Singapore has also hosted major international sporting events such as the Youth Olympic Games and the Formula One Singapore Grand Prix, which have brought about greater awareness and appreciation of sports.\n\nDespite the efforts made, some achievements in sports are still undervalued. This is partly due to the mainstream media\u2019s tendency to prioritise news on academic achievements and high-profile events such as elections. Consequently, the media coverage on sports is often limited to major events such as the Olympics and major leagues, while achievements in minor leagues or individual performances are under-recognised. For instance, a Singaporean para-athlete Yip Pin Xiu, who won two gold medals in the Rio Paralympics, was given limited coverage in comparison to the coverage given to Olympic medalists. This seems to imply that only achievements in mainstream sports receive significant attention in Singapore.\n\nFurthermore, while successful athletes in Singapore are often lauded for their achievements and awarded monetary incentives and scholarships, their recognition is often short-lived. As such, a culture of sports is not deeply ingrained among Singaporeans as opposed to nations such as the United States or China. This lack of long-term recognition may result in fewer individuals being motivated to pursue sports and result in a less competitive sports scene. \n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has made significant strides in promoting and developing sports, there are still areas that require improvement in the recognition of sporting achievements. It is important for society to shift its focus from merely glamourising sports during major events, but also to focus on highlighting minor sporting achievements and creating a longer-lasting recognition. Only then will Singaporeans appreciate the significant impact of sports on both individual and national levels."

                "prompt": "\"IN THE GLOBAL AGE WE INHABIT, THERE IS NO JUSTIFICATION FOR NATIONAL BOUNDARIES.\" HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE?",
                "response": "The debate on whether national boundaries are still relevant in today's globalized world is one that has been ongoing for some time now. While some argue that national boundaries should be upheld, others believe that there is no justification for them. In my opinion, national boundaries still hold some value, albeit to a limited extent.\n\nFirstly, the preservation of national identities is crucial as it fosters a sense of belonging and unity amongst individuals within their respective nations. For instance, Singapore, a small island nation, is built on the notion of racial and religious harmony, and its national identity is seen as a reflection of this. The preservation of such a unique national identity can only be achieved through the boundaries present whereby laws, culture, and traditions are singularly enforced.\n\nAdditionally, national boundaries are instrumental in certain policy-making decisions that may affect the individuals within a nation. For instance, changes to education curriculums or healthcare policies may be tailored to the specific needs of the citizenry of that particular country. Such a customisation of policies can only be carried out via national boundaries and not otherwise.\n\nHowever, while national boundaries have their advantages, technological advancements and globalisation have made the world more interconnected than ever before. The free flow of people, capital, and ideas other than being economically beneficial, can also help improve the standard of living and quality of life globally. For instance, advancements in healthcare research can be shared across nations and utilized to develop effective treatments for diseases that were once considered incurable. \n\nFurthermore, globalisation can help foster international cooperation to solve pressing issues such as climate change, terrorism and pandemics. As these challenges do not recognise national boundaries, collaboration on a global scale is necessary to address them effectively.\n\nTo conclude, while national boundaries have significant value regarding the preservation of national identity and being able to implement policy decisions that cater to specific needs, the benefits of globalisation far outweigh their relevance. International cooperation is necessary to solve the world's problems and to improve the quality of life globally. Therefore, while national boundaries should still be upheld, they should not act as a barrier to international cooperation and unity."

                "prompt": "IN AN AGE OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, IS A SINGLE CAREER FOR LIFE REALISTIC?",
                "response": "In today's world, technological advancements are changing the way we live, work and learn. Many people are often asked what they want to be when they grow up, which implies the idea of finding a single career for life. However, in this age of rapid technological advancement, is a single career for life realistic? Let us take a closer look.\n\nFirstly, it is essential to realize that the workforce is constantly evolving. The job market has become more dynamic, and many jobs that exist today may not exist in the future. Therefore, holding a single career for an entire lifetime is not practical. For instance, a person who was involved in film photography may have lost their job when the digital camera was invented.\n\nMoreover, technology is causing significant disruptions in the job market. The roles that humans play in different industries are changing as machines and algorithms are replacing certain jobs. Many blue-collar jobs like factory work and agriculture will become obsolete over time and will cease to exist. Therefore, individuals must be prepared to adapt to changing technologies. Furthermore, individuals who are not adapting may become unemployable or irrelevant in the job market.\n\nThirdly, the introduction of modern technologies has made remote work possible and has created multiple income streams. The rise of the gig economy and freelance work makes it possible for individuals to work across different industries and gain experience in various fields. This creates more opportunities than holding one permanent job and increases their chances of building a more meaningful career.\n\nHowever, even in this fast-paced world, some individuals may prefer and be suited for certain careers. In such cases, they may hold on to that job for many years. For example, a doctor or lawyer may dedicate their entire life to their profession. Being passionate about one's work can make it easier to gain expertise, and this can bring a certain level of fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, given the rate of change in the job market and the introduction of machines and artificial intelligence, having a single career for life is not realistic. However, adapting to change and developing new skills and experiences continuously can make you agile enough to thrive in this age of rapid technological advancements."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE PURSUIT OF CONTINUOUS ECONOMIC GROWTH A DESIRABLE GOAL?",
                "response": "The pursuit of continuous economic growth has been a primary goal of governments and corporations alike. However, the extent to which this goal is desirable is a topic of much debate. While economic growth does bring about benefits such as increased employment opportunities and a better standard of living, it also presents several negative consequences such as environmental degradation and income inequality.\n\nFirstly, economic growth leads to increased employment opportunities as it creates demand for more goods and services, leading to the creation of new jobs. This allows individuals to earn an income, which subsequently raises their standard of living. In turn, this leads to the growth of the economy as consumer spending increases, creating a virtuous cycle of economic growth. For instance, the economic growth of Singapore in the past decades has allowed for the creation of various industries and job opportunities, leading to the lowering of the unemployment rate and a better standard of living for its citizens.\n\nSecondly, economic growth also provides governments with greater financial resources, which can be invested into social welfare programs such as healthcare and education, leading to further improvement in quality of life. For example, the economic growth of South Korea has allowed it to become a leading nation in innovation, and its reinvestment in its education system has resulted in a highly-educated population.\n\nHowever, the pursuit of continuous economic growth also comes with negative consequences. One of these is environmental degradation, as economic expansion often results in the exploitation of natural resources and pollution, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and the quality of the environment. For instance, China's rapid economic growth has led to severe pollution problems such as smog, affecting the health of its citizens and damaging the environment.\n\nAnother consequence is the growing income inequality within society, which arises from the concentration of wealth in a small group of people as the economy grows. This income inequality can lead to social unrest and instability within the society. For example, the widening wealth gap in the United States has become a topic of much political debate and has led to social tension between different societal classes.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic growth does provide various benefits such as employment opportunities and financial resources for social welfare, the pursuit of continuous economic growth must be balanced alongside the negative consequences it presents such as environmental degradation and income inequality. Governments must take into account the human and environmental costs of unbridled growth and move towards a more sustainable economic model."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS FAILURE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF SUCCESS?",
                "response": "Success and failure are two sides of the same coin. Both are crucial aspects of one's growth and development. It is often said that failure is an essential part of success. This essay aims to explore the extent to which this statement holds true.\n\nPoint: Failure acts as a catalyst for growth and success.\nElaboration: Failure, in many ways, is a learning experience that teaches individuals valuable lessons in life. It allows people to learn from their mistakes and challenges them to do better. Failure forces individuals to analyze their shortcomings and work towards rectifying them, eventually leading to growth and success.\nExample: One of the most famous examples of individuals who failed multiple times before achieving success is Thomas Edison. Edison's numerous failed attempts at inventing the light bulb finally resulted in success, which goes to show that failure can lead to eventual success.\nLink: Failing is not the defeat but a sign that individuals are pushing their boundaries. Hence, one can say that failure is an essential aspect of success.\n\nPoint: Failure helps individuals develop resilience and perseverance.\nElaboration: Failure helps individuals develop essential traits like resilience and perseverance, which are crucial to succeeding in life. Repeated failures teach individuals to keep trying, no matter what, and persevere towards their goals. Such resilience helps individuals deal with the challenges life throws at them.\nExample: Michael Jordan, one of the most celebrated basketball players of all time, was once cut from his high school basketball team. This setback only served to inspire him to work harder and strive towards success. He often cites this as a turning point in his life, which taught him valuable lessons and made him one of the greatest players in the sport's history.\nLink: Resilience and perseverance are qualities that separate individuals who succeed from those who do not. Thus, failure is an essential part of success as it helps individuals develop these much-needed qualities.\n\nPoint: Failure can lead to unexpected opportunities and success.\nElaboration: Failure can be a blessing in disguise, leading individuals towards unexpected opportunities and success. When individuals fail, they are often forced to reevaluate their decisions and paths, leading to new and unexplored opportunities.\nExample: Steve Jobs was famously fired from his own company, Apple, in the early years of his career. However, the experience taught Jobs valuable lessons and gave him the opportunity to explore other ventures. This, in turn, led to his return to Apple and the creation of some of the most iconic products in the tech industry today.\nLink: Failure can open new doors of opportunity that individuals might have never come across otherwise, leading to unexpected success.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that failure is, indeed, an essential part of success. It helps individuals grow, develop essential qualities like resilience and perseverance, and can lead to unexpected opportunities. However, it is imperative to remember that failure, in itself, is not success. True success lies in learning from one's failures and working towards a better tomorrow."

                "response": "Prisons are often considered as a primary method of addressing the problem of crime. However, the effectiveness of prisons in reducing criminal activities depends on various factors. This essay will examine the effectiveness of prisons as a solution to the problem of crime.\n\nFirstly, prisons are effective in providing punishment to those who have broken the law. When criminals are sent to prison, they are stripped of their freedom and made to live under strict rules and regulations. This serves as a deterrent to people who are considering committing a crime, and may prevent them from doing so. For example, the high-security prisons in Singapore have very harsh rules, and inmates have to adhere to them strictly. The knowledge of such a fact might deter people from committing a crime.\n\nMoreover, prisons can be effective in rehabilitating criminals. Inmates can be provided with education and training programs that can equip them with the skills they need to reintegrate back into society when they are released. For instance, prisons in Sweden provide opportunities for inmates to acquire vocational skills that could help them when they leave prison, while also receiving psychological counselling sessions. Thus, such programs can help to reduce recidivism rates, in the long run, resulting in a reduction in crime.\n\nHowever, critics argue that prisons are not a long-term solution to the problem of crime. Research shows that high incarceration rates do not necessarily lead to lower crime rates. Furthermore, the effectiveness of rehabilitation programs in prisons is often debated, with some suggesting that they are inadequate and that ex-convicts continue to struggle after their release. A report by the Prison Policy Initiative found that the majority of inmates released from prison re-offend within five years, highlighting the failure of rehabilitation programs in some prisons.\n\nIn conclusion, while prisons can act as a form of punishment and avenues for rehabilitating criminals, their effectiveness in reducing crime is debatable. In my opinion, prisons should not be seen as a stand-alone solution but instead used in tandem with other programs aimed at preventing crime, such as mental health care, education, and job training initiatives. Together, these measures can significantly reduce crime rates, and allow for a safer society."

                "prompt": "DOES GLOBAL AID REALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST?",
                "response": "Global aid is a term that refers to the assistance provided to developing countries by nations, international organizations, and non-governmental organizations. The primary goal of aid is to alleviate poverty and promote development. However, the effectiveness of global aid in improving the lives of those who need it the most has been contested. In this essay, we will explore whether global aid indeed improves the lives of those in need.\n\nPoint: Global aid can provide vital resources to developing countries.\nElaboration: Aid can provide developing countries with funding, food aid, building infrastructure and medical resources.\nExample: The Gates Foundation has helped millions around the world with vaccinations and medical aid.\nLink: The provision of these resources can lead to the improvement of basic living standards such as hygiene, health and food security.\n\nPoint: Global aid can facilitate access to education.\nElaboration: Aid for education can include funding for the building of schools, provision of materials for learning such as books and computers, and training for teachers.\nExample: The Malala Fund has assisted in the education of young girls in Pakistan and other developing countries.\nLink: Access to education can lead to improved employability and, in turn, higher income and an improved quality of life.\n\nPoint: Global aid can also have negative consequences.\nElaboration: Aid can create dependency on foreign aid in the recipient countries, further marginalizing smaller businesses in developing countries.\nExample: According to reports, 80% of the rice that Cambodia received from the United States of America has had a negative effect on local rice farmers.\nLink: Dependency on aid can create a fatal cycle of poverty and negatively impact economic development.\n\nIn conclusion, global aid can improve the lives of those who need it most by providing resources such as food, medical aid and education. However, aid can also have negative consequences, such as creating dependency and negatively impacting local industries. Therefore, it is important that aid is given while taking all factors into account and is used efficiently to make a long-lasting impact on the lives of those who aim to improve."

                "prompt": "\"INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY IS ALWAYS A DESIRABLE GOAL.\" DO YOU AGREE?",
                "response": "Increasing life expectancy is arguably one of the most significant achievements in medical history. While some may argue that it is not desirable, I strongly believe that extending human life is always a desirable goal. In this essay, I will elaborate on the reasons supporting my stance.\n\nFirst and foremost, a longer life expectancy means more time for individuals to pursue their goals and ambitions. In modern society, people have a variety of personal and professional pursuits which they hope to achieve. With an increase in life expectancy, they can enjoy more time to realise and accomplish their goals, be it in their career, education or personal relationships. For instance, a person may choose to pursue higher education, travel the world, or indulge in a hobby like painting, which may take more time than he or she initially anticipated. By extending human life, people can have the opportunity to relish the little moments in life, which they might otherwise miss.\n\nSecondly, an increase in life expectancy could also lead to the development of new medical treatments and cures for diseases. With a longer life expectancy, there is a greater demand for innovative medical treatments to ensure that quality of life is maintained in old age. Additionally, substantial progress has been made in areas such as gene editing, which could have the potential to eradicate some of the deadliest diseases. With extended human life, there would be more time to research and develop treatments to cure diseases, and thereby provide people with a better quality of life.\n\nLastly, an increase in life expectancy offers a chance for the preservation of valuable intellectual resources and personal experiences. When a person dies young, he or she takes away valuable experiences and knowledge that could be passed on to future generations. Extending human life could permit individuals to create and share their experiences, knowledge, and insights with others. Scientists, entrepreneurs, authors, and leaders, for instance, could share their learned experiences and contribute to progress and advancement.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that increasing life expectancy is a desirable goal. A longer life span would provide individuals with more time to pursue their goals and ambitions, incentivise medical progress and allow for the preservation of valuable intellectual resources. While the pursuit of prolonged life should not come at the cost of one's quality of life, increasing human life expectancy would undoubtedly have a positive impact on society."

                "prompt": "DO YOU AGREE THAT GOOD PARENTING IS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING IN YOUR SOCIETY TODAY?",
                "response": "In today's society, good parenting has become increasingly challenging. While parenting has always been a difficult job, there are several factors that have made it even harder. In this essay, I will explain why I agree that good parenting is becoming more arduous.\n\nOne of the reasons why good parenting is more challenging today is the influence of technology on children. With the dawn of the digital age, children have easy access to electronic gadgets like smartphones, tablets, and laptops. Parents find it tough to regulate screen time and monitor the content their children are exposed to. This has led to negative impacts like addiction to social media, cyber-bullying, and exposure to inappropriate content.\n\nAnother factor that has made parenting more challenging is the increasing stress levels of modern-day parents. Many parents today work full-time jobs and find it challenging to balance their work and home life. When they return home, they may not have the energy or time to give sufficient attention to their children, leading to a lack of bonding and communication between parents and their children.\n\nFurthermore, the rise in mental health issues amongst children has made good parenting an even tougher challenge. Children today are dealing with anxiety, depression, and stress. Parents have to be well-equipped to recognize and handle these problems. However, with limited resources, it can be challenging to provide the right support and care for their children.\n\nTo conclude, it is clear that good parenting in our society today is increasingly challenging, with the influence of technology, the increasing stress levels of parents, and the rise of mental health issues amongst children. While there is no one-size-fits-all approach to parenting, it is important that parents remain informed, engaged, and grounded in their values, to provide the best possible care and support for their children."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT DOES SOCIAL MEDIA POSE A CHALLENGE FOR THE GOVERNMENT?",
                "response": "Social media has undoubtedly revolutionized the way we communicate and interact with one another. However, the rise of social media has also presented challenges for the government in various areas. In this essay, I will explore the extent to which social media poses a challenge for the government.\n\nFirstly, social media has made it easier for information to spread rapidly, both true and false. This is particularly challenging for the government as false information can cause panic and unrest among the populace. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, false information about the virus has sparked fear and confusion among people, making it harder for the government to manage the situation effectively. As such, the government must take steps to monitor and regulate social media platforms to prevent the spread of inaccurate information.\n\nSecondly, social media has also given rise to unregulated political campaigns. Political parties can now use social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter, to spread their message to a much wider audience. This allows political parties to bypass traditional media channels and create their own propaganda, which can be problematic as it can lead to polarisation and division in society. Moreover, there is a risk of foreign interference in local politics, as we have seen in the recent US presidential elections. To counter this, the government must implement laws regulating political advertising on social media platforms and enforcing transparency in campaign financing.\n\nAdditionally, social media has given rise to cyberbullying and online harassment. This poses a significant challenge for the government as it needs to strike a balance between protecting freedom of speech and protecting individuals from harm. The government must implement laws to address cyberbullying and online harassment while also ensuring that these laws are not used to curb free speech.\n\nOn the other hand, social media has also presented opportunities for the government to engage with citizens and gather feedback on policies and initiatives. For example, government agencies can use social media platforms to disseminate information and gather feedback on policy decisions. This can improve transparency and accountability in governance. Moreover, social media also allows for greater citizen participation in policymaking, which can help to strengthen democracy.\n\nIn conclusion, social media poses significant challenges for the government in terms of misinformation, unregulated political campaigns, and online harassment. However, it also presents opportunities for citizen engagement and feedback. The government must strike a balance between regulating social media platforms and promoting free speech to ensure that social media is used responsibly for the betterment of society."

                "prompt": "HOW SUCCESSFUL HAS YOUR SOCIETY BEEN IN EMBRACING THE OLD?",
                "response": "The success of a society can be gauged by how well it treats its seniors. After all, senior citizens form the backbone of our society, having contributed to its growth and development through their wisdom and experience. However, with the rapid pace of technological and societal change, it has become increasingly challenging for society to embrace the old. In this essay, I will explore the ways in which society has succeeded in integrating its aging population and the areas in which progress needs to be made.\n\nFirstly, Singapore's healthcare system has undoubtedly been a success in embracing the old. Our government has implemented several measures to ensure that older Singaporeans receive the medical attention they require. Despite the high cost of healthcare, the government subsidises healthcare for the elderly, reducing the financial burden of medical costs. In addition, the government has also introduced eldercare services equipped with medical-grade equipment and facilities, which provide various forms of assistance such as home care, rehabilitation and end-of-life care, ensuring that senior citizens are well taken care of.\n\nHowever, there is still room for improvement when it comes to integrating the elderly in society. One of Singapore's biggest challenges is ageism, which is the discrimination or stereotyping of individuals based on their age. This is a phenomenon that is not just limited to Singapore, but a global issue. Ageism can lead to negative attitudes and behaviours towards older adults, making them feel isolated and alone, and can lead to serious consequences, including affecting mental health, physical health and well-being.\n\nFurthermore, elderly citizens in Singapore often find it difficult to participate in economic, social and political activities. Many older Singaporeans experience difficulty in finding jobs due to age-related perceptions and companies looking for younger employees. Socially, seniors' lack of mobility can result in their lack of involvement in leisure activities and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and even face age-related prejudices from their peers. Lastly, senior citizens are notably underrepresented in politics, with only a handful of senior politicians in Singapore's political scene.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore's healthcare system has been highly successful in embracing senior citizens, it is essential to ensure the elderly are fully integrated into society. The issue of ageism and elderly participation in economic, social and political activities deserves more attention from our society. It is crucial to build a fair and inclusive environment with opportunities and support for our seniors, which will enable them to continue to contribute to our society for as long as possible."

                "prompt": "IS CENSORSHIP JUSTIFIABLE?",
                "response": "Censorship has been a topic of much debate in recent times, with the advent of social media and the internet. Some say that censorship is necessary to prevent offensive or harmful content from spreading, while others argue that it violates free speech and can be used to suppress dissenting views. In this essay, I aim to explore both sides of the argument and come to a conclusion on whether censorship is justifiable or not.\n\nOn one hand, supporters of censorship argue that it is necessary to prevent harmful content from spreading. For example, in Singapore, the Media Development Authority (MDA) is responsible for regulating the media and ensuring that content does not incite hatred, promote violence, or undermine religious and racial harmony. This is because such content can be harmful to society as a whole and can contribute to social unrest.\n\nFurthermore, supporters argue that censorship is necessary to protect vulnerable groups, such as children. For example, in the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has regulations in place to ensure that indecent or profane content is not broadcast during hours when children are likely to be watching. This is because children are impressionable and can be negatively affected by such content.\n\nOn the other hand, opponents of censorship argue that it violates the right to free speech. They argue that people should be allowed to express their opinions, even if they are unpopular or controversial. For example, in China, the government censors the internet and prevents people from accessing certain websites and social media platforms. This is because the government wants to control what people see and prevent the spread of dissenting views.\n\nFurthermore, opponents argue that censorship can be used as a tool to suppress dissenting views and maintain the status quo. For example, during the Cold War, the United States government censored communist propaganda and prevented the spread of socialist ideas. This is because the government wanted to maintain its capitalist system and prevent the spread of leftist ideologies.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship can be justified in some cases, such as preventing harmful content from spreading or protecting vulnerable groups, it should not be used as a tool to suppress free speech and maintain the status quo. Governments should strike a balance between regulating harmful content and allowing people to express their opinions and ideas freely. Ultimately, censorship should only be used as a last resort, and only when there is no other way to prevent harm to society."

                "response": "Modern science has certainly revolutionized our lives in ways that were unimaginable a few centuries ago. However, amidst all the progress and success, there is a growing concern that science has made us arrogant instead of teaching us humility. This essay will explore the advantages and disadvantages of modern science and argue that science, despite its benefits, has indeed made us overly arrogant.\n\nAdvocates of modern science argue that it has brought significant progress in fields such as medicine, communication, and transportation. With medical advancements, we can now diagnose and cure diseases that were once considered incurable. Communication has been greatly enhanced with long-distance communication methods such as video conferencing and the internet, which has allowed us to stay connected with our loved ones who are far away. Transportation marvels such as airplanes have made travel faster and more convenient. These advancements have brought immense comfort and ease to our daily lives.\n\nHowever, the danger of modern science is that it has made us overconfident and over-reliant on technology. As a result, we have become creatures of instant gratification, expecting everything be done quickly and flawlessly. We have become so addicted to our smart-phones, tablets and other gadgets that we are dependent on them even for our basic daily routines.\n\nMoreover, modern science has given us a false sense of invincibility. We believe that technology and science have an answer to every problem, and that we can eventually overcome every challenge that comes our way. This kind of thinking makes us blind to the limitations of science, and we forget that science is not infallible and that it is always incomplete.\n\nIn conclusion, modern science has brought immense progress and transformation to our world. However, there is also an underlying danger that has come with this progress. Instead of teaching us humility, modern science has made us arrogant. This has resulted in us becoming too reliant on technology and losing touch with the sense of wonder and awe that comes with experiencing the mystery of nature. Therefore, we must remain aware of the limitations of science and be open to accepting that some mysteries cannot be explained by our technological advancements."

                "response": "Environmental issues are a significant challenge for the world today. Many people believe that only developed nations are responsible for saving the environment, while others argue that all nations are accountable for preserving the planet. In my opinion, while developed nations have more resources and capabilities to implement sustainable practices, it is the collective responsibility of all nations to save the environment.\n\nFirstly, developed nations such as the United States, Japan, and Germany are leaders in sustainable practices, and they have invested in technologies to reduce their carbon footprint. For example, Germany replaced fossil fuel-powered plants with renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power. Furthermore, they enforce strict environmental regulations on industries and businesses, which has led to reducing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, developed nations have more advanced technologies, funding, and policies to save the environment.\n\nHowever, developing countries such as India and China are now the major contributors to climate change. Therefore, sustainable practices must be implemented globally. Every nation has a responsibility since environmental issues are not limited to a specific region. Developing nations must also adopt environmentally friendly practices and reduce their emissions, such as investing in public transportation, recycling programs, and using renewable energy sources.\n\nMoreover, protecting the environment should not become an excuse to limit the economic growth of developing nations. The world needs to help these nations develop their infrastructure and economy in a sustainable way. Developed nations should support developing countries by sharing technology and expertise. Developed nations must realize the importance of empowering developing countries to become sustainable and avoid creating an economic divide between advanced and developing nations.\n\nIn conclusion, it is vital to acknowledge that saving the environment is not solely the responsibility of developed nations. Developed nations must follow their environmentally friendly policies, and developing nations must also take steps to reduce their carbon footprint. Both developed and developing nations must work together to limit environmental degradation and implement sustainable practices. It is only through global efforts that we can protect the environment for current and future generations."

                "prompt": "CAN EDUCATION SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS?",
                "response": "Education is often hailed as one of the most important tools in improving the world. It has the power to drive economic growth, reduce poverty, and create informed and active citizens. However, it is not a panacea for all issues. Despite its many benefits, education cannot single-handedly solve all problems. This essay will examine education's limitations in addressing societal issues.\n\nFirstly, education by itself cannot guarantee economic development. While education is a critical component of economic growth, it is not sufficient on its own. Other factors like stable political systems, good governance, sound macroeconomic policies, and investment in physical infrastructure also play a significant role. Without these factors, education cannot unleash its full potential in producing a productive and innovative workforce.\n\nSecondly, education cannot entirely fix social issues such as inequality, discrimination, and prejudice. While it helps individuals to gain more knowledge and become more informed, it does not guarantee empathy or compassion towards others. For instance, a highly educated individual can still hold discriminatory beliefs or act in ways that perpetuate inequality. Hence, social issues require a more comprehensive approach that includes education, but not solely relying on it.\n\nThirdly, education does not always produce ethically upright citizens. Education's primary aim is to impart knowledge and skills, but it does not necessarily guarantee moral values and principles. For instance, some individuals with high levels of education have been involved in illegal and unethical practices like embezzlement, corruption, and fraud. Therefore, morality and ethical values cannot automatically be induced through education, but such values must also be instilled in children and young adults.\n\nLastly, education cannot erase cultural differences and language barriers. Cultural diversity is vital in a globalized world, but it also creates potential misunderstandings and conflicts. Education can promote intercultural awareness and mutual respect, but it cannot eliminate differences entirely.\n\nIn conclusion, while education has many benefits, it cannot solve every problem by itself. Shortcomings require other complementary tools to address issues like inequality, corruption, cultural differences, and other societal issues. Therefore, a more comprehensive approach that integrates education with other tools and strategies is necessary to create a better world."

                "prompt": "\"AS SCIENCE ADVANCES, THE HUMAN RACE REGRESSES.\" IS THIS A FAIR COMMENT?",
                "response": "Throughout history, science has made significant strides in the development of the human race. With advances in medicine, technology and understanding of the natural world, this progress has enabled humanity to achieve safer and more prosperous living conditions than ever before. However, the question arises as to whether such scientific progress has enabled the human race to regress in other aspects, such as ethical considerations, environmental conservation and social justice. This essay explores both sides of the argument to examine whether the idea that \"as science advances, the human race regresses\" is a fair comment.\n\nOn the one hand, scientific advancement has led to ethical concerns that could be viewed as regression. For example, the development of genetic engineering technologies has led to the manipulation of DNA, which raises concerns about the limits of manipulating human nature. While genetic engineering has the potential to eradicate genetic diseases, the potential consequences of these interventions remain unclear, therefore, ethical and moral considerations need to be taken into account to prevent the abuse of these technologies. As a result, the advancement of science in this area can be seen as a form of regression in terms of ethical considerations.\n\nOn the other hand, science and technology have also been instrumental in both mitigating and addressing environmental degradation. For instance, the science of climate change has raised awareness of the impacts of human activities on the planet and the need for conservation efforts. Additionally, multiple engineering and technological solutions have been developed to reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of renewable energy sources. These advancements mitigate the effects of human activities on the environment, and foster the need to ensure the sustainability of human activities, which ultimately benefits future generations.\n\nFurthermore, scientific advancements have enabled humanity to progress in the area of social justice. Science has allowed for the development of new technologies that have improved access to education, healthcare and communication across the globe. For example, medical science has developed drugs that have eradicated deadly diseases, such as smallpox. Additionally, advancements in information technology have provided access to education and healthcare in developing countries, which were previously inaccessible. As a result, scientific advancements have enabled humanity to progress towards a fair and equal society.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea that \"as science advances, the human race regresses\" is an oversimplified statement that does not consider the complexity of science and its implications. While science has raised ethical concerns about the manipulation of nature and manipulating human behaviour, it has also led to enormous advancements of humanity and the planet. Thus, it is important to consider both the positive and negative aspects of scientific advancements to have a holistic approach to its role in human society."

                "prompt": "\"SOCIAL MEDIA DIVIDES MORE THAN IT UNITES\". TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS TRUE?",
                "response": "In today's age of technology, social media has become an integral part of our lives. It has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information. However, with its growing omnipresence, people have started to point out its drawbacks and one of the most common criticisms of social media is that it divides more than it unites. In this essay, I will examine the extent to which this statement is true.\n\nTo some extent, social media does divide people. Firstly, social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are often saturated with fake news, propaganda, and hate speech, which can create divisions within communities. For example, during the 2016 US Presidential Elections, social media platforms were flooded with sensationalized news articles that influenced voters' opinions, which further intensified the divide between the supporters of both parties. Secondly, social media usage can also isolate individuals as they may prefer engaging with their online community instead of real-life relationships. This can lead to people becoming more insular and ignoring real-life communities that are critical for building social cohesion.\n\nHowever, it would be inaccurate to say that social media is entirely responsible for dividing people. Social media, in fact, is an excellent tool for uniting people from different parts of the world. For instance, social media provided a platform for people from all over the world to connect and engage in conversation during the Black Lives Matter movement, which brought together people of different races and backgrounds to fight against systemic racism. Additionally, social media is also a platform for grass-root movements as social media hashtags initiates political and social movements.\n\nMoreover, social media platforms are an excellent medium for businesses to connect with their customers. Through LinkedIn, people can get job opportunities, which has created a professional community. As a result, businesses and corporations made use of social media to create marketing strategies specifically targeting the younger age group, which proved to be beneficial for both parties. Hence, social media has the capacity to unite people as well.\n\nIn conclusion, it would not be wholly accurate to believe that social media only divides more than it unites. While it may have some factors that can divide people, social media can serve as a vital tool in promoting social cohesion, breaking down geographical borders and creating interest-based niches. Social media, therefore, is a double-edged sword that can be used for both good and bad, and its impact on global society is still being determined."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY IN YOUR COUNTRY?",
                "response": "In every society, there are individuals belonging to diverse socio-economic backgrounds, race, religion, and culture. The question, therefore, arises if it's possible to have a fair and inclusive society in Singapore. While some may argue that achieving this task is impossible, I believe that with conscious efforts, Singapore can create an equitable and inclusive society that respects diversity.\n\nFirstly, Singapore has always been known for its merit-based system, which provides equal opportunities for all. The government has set up various programmes and policies targeting various groups to ensure inclusivity. For instance, the \"Kidstart\" scheme that provides funding for children from lower-income families to access early childhood education. This initiative ensures that children of all economic backgrounds are given the same start in life.\n\nSecondly, Singapore is known for its strong anti-discrimination laws that protect individuals from discrimination based on their race, religion, gender, age, or nationality. The government has also established the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles (IRCC) to promote interfaith and inter-racial harmony. In this way, Singapore ensures that every individual is given the chance to thrive in society without fear of discrimination.\n\nAdditionally, Singapore has also established community involvement groups such as the People's Association (PA). The PA provides platforms for residents to come together to participate in social and cultural events, regardless of their background. Such community involvement initiatives promote inclusivity and social cohesion in Singapore.\n\nHowever, there is still room for improvement in Singapore. Despite the efforts, there are still disparities in terms of income levels and accessibility to opportunities. While meritocracy is a good system, it may not guarantee equal access to opportunities for all individuals. For instance, socio-economic factors may affect the access and quality of education provided to children. Therefore, the government should consider stepping in to ensure equal education opportunities to break the cycle of poverty. \n\nIn conclusion, while achieving a completely fair and inclusive society may be an ambitious goal, Singapore has made commendable efforts towards this goal. The government's policies and programmes complemented by strong anti-discriminatory laws and community involvement initiatives have set a strong foundation for inclusivity. However, more work needs to be done to ensure equitable access to opportunities, especially for those from disadvantaged backgrounds."

However, with the rise of technology, there has been a growing concern about its impact on the skill levels of individuals. In this essay, we shall explore how technology has had a negative impact on the skill levels of people.\n\nFirstly, technology has reduced the need for manual labour, causing individuals to become increasingly reliant on machines. For example, in the past, farmers would have to tend to their crops or harvest them by hand. However, with the introduction of sophisticated farming machinery, such as tractors and harvesters, the need for manual labour has diminished. As a result, many farmers have lost the traditional skills and knowledge that were once necessary for farming. This reduces the overall skill level of people, as they rely on machines to do the work.\n\nSecondly, technology has caused people to become overly reliant on spell-check and grammar-check software, leading to a decline in writing and communication skills. In the past, people would have to write by hand or use typewriters, requiring them to be mindful of spelling and grammar. However, with the advent of word-processing software, people can rely on automatic spelling and grammar correction. This has reduced the need for people to proofread, leading to a decline in their language skills.\n\nThirdly, technology has had a detrimental effect on social skills, especially in children. With the proliferation of gaming consoles, smartphones and tablets, children are spending more time indoors than ever before. They are no longer playing outside or engaging in outdoor activities that require physical and social skills. Instead, they are spending hours binge-watching videos and playing video games. This has resulted in a decline in social skills, making it harder for children to interact with the world outside their screens.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has its advantages, it has had a negative impact on the skill levels of people. It has reduced the need for manual labour, resulting in lost traditional skills and knowledge. It has also led to a decline in writing and communication skills due to automatic correction software. Furthermore, technology has made children more reliant on screens, resulting in a decline in social skills. Therefore, it is essential that we strike a balance between technology and traditional knowledge to ensure that our skills do not become obsolete."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR CAN ONE INDIVIDUAL MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN YOUR SOCIETY?",
                "response": "In today\u2019s world, there is no doubt that we need positive change in our society. However, when we look at the state of our society, it is not uncommon to feel helpless or overwhelmed. Despite this, each and every individual has the ability to make a positive impact on society. Therefore, it is important to ask ourselves, \u201cHow far can one individual make a positive change in society?\u201d \n\nFirst and foremost, it is important to recognise that change often starts small. One individual may not be able to change the world in one day, but they can certainly start by making small efforts around them. For instance, an individual could start volunteering at a local charity, picking up trash at a beach or park, or even just smiling at strangers. These small acts of kindness can make a big difference in someone\u2019s day and can inspire others to do the same.\n\nAnother way in which individuals can make a positive change in society is by using their voice. This can be through peaceful protest, signing petitions, or even just sharing positive messages on social media. One individual may not be able to change a policy or law on their own, but with the help of a community of people who share the same goal, change can happen.\n\nMoreover, individuals can lead by example. By making conscious decisions and lifestyle changes, individuals can encourage others to do the same. For instance, by making choices that are environmentally friendly, such as bringing reusable bags when shopping or reducing plastic usage, an individual can set an example for others to follow.\n\nLastly, one individual can inspire change by educating themselves and others. By learning about issues and finding solutions to problems, individuals can create awareness and motivate others to take action. Through education, individuals can also challenge misguided beliefs and ideologies, fostering a more inclusive and holistic society.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that one individual can make a positive change in society. Through small acts of kindness, using their voice, leading by example, and education, individuals can inspire others and create a better world. We must remember that even though we may feel small in the grand scheme of things, our individual actions can have a significant impact, and together, we can achieve great things."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS IT FAIR TO CONSIDER THE ELDERLY TO BE A BURDEN ON SOCIETY?",
                "response": "In a world which is increasingly becoming individualistic, there is a growing perception that the elderly, who have retired from work and are no longer economically productive, are a burden on society. However, it is not fair to solely consider the elderly as a liability without considering their immense contributions to society.\n\nFirst and foremost, the elderly have vast amounts of experience and knowledge which can be invaluable to society. Their experiences and wisdom can help shape policies and provide guidance to the younger generation. For example, Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, remained active in politics even in his later years and his insights and advice were highly valued.\n\nFurthermore, the elderly play an important role in the family unit as caregivers. Grandparents often take on the role of primary caregivers for their grandchildren, allowing their own children to continue working and contributing to society. In many cases, without the support of grandparents, families would not be able to function as effectively.\n\nAdditionally, the elderly have worked hard and contributed to society throughout their lives and should be able to enjoy their golden years without feeling like they are a burden on society. They have paid their dues in taxes and have contributed to the country's economy through their jobs, and they deserve to retire with dignity and respect.\n\nLastly, it is important to remember that the elderly are not a monolithic group. They are a diverse group with different backgrounds, experiences, and needs. It is unfair to generalize and view all elderly individuals as a burden on society.\n\nIn conclusion, it is not fair to consider the elderly as a burden on society. Their vast experiences, contributions to the family unit, and role in shaping policies are invaluable and cannot be overlooked. Instead, society should appreciate and respect them for their contributions and provide them with the support they need to enjoy their golden years with dignity."

                "prompt": "\"PEOPLE ARE PLACING TOO MUCH FAITH IN MEDICAL SCIENCE.\" DO YOU AGREE?",
                "response": "Medical science has undoubtedly made remarkable progress in the past few decades. It has contributed to the advances in healthcare that have enhanced the life expectancy and quality of life of people all around the world. However, some argue that people today are placing too much faith in medical science. In my opinion, I partially agree with this statement as although medical science can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, it is not a perfect solution.\n\nFirstly, medical science has its limitations, and hence we should not completely trust it. Medicines and treatments can cause side effects, and misdiagnoses are not uncommon in the medical field. Medical professionals have to keep up with the latest research and training continually. Medical science is also constantly evolving, meaning that what works today may not work in the future. Therefore, we should not become over-reliant on medical science.\n\nSecondly, there are alternative treatments that people should consider as well. Some people turn to traditional medicine or even complementary and alternative treatments such as acupuncture, chiropractic treatment, and herbal medications. These alternative treatments may not have scientific evidence or research to prove their benefits, but some individuals have found them to provide relief and healing, even if only on a placebo effect.\n\nLastly, people tend to neglect prevention and a healthy lifestyle in favour of relying on medicine to cure them of diseases. Medical science can help treat diseases, but it is much easier and cheaper to prevent them in the first place. Prevention comes in many forms such as exercise, a healthy diet, regular check-ups, proper hygiene, and avoiding risky behaviours. Therefore, we should not rely solely on medicine but also focus on healthy living.\n\nIn conclusion, while medical science has undoubtedly brought about positive changes, it is not a perfect solution. We should instead adopt a more balanced approach, keeping in mind that there are still limits to medical science and alternative treatments available. Additionally, incorporating prevention and healthy living into our lifestyles will go a long way in maintaining our health and wellbeing."

                "prompt": "IS IMMIGRATION THE KEY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF AGEING POPULATIONS? ",
                "response": "With the advancement of modern medicine, people are living much longer than they used to in the past. While this is great news, it has led to an increasing problem of ageing populations. An ageing population refers to a scenario where a significant proportion of the population is made up of the elderly. Many countries have already been experiencing this issue, and have been considering various solutions to mitigate the impacts. One proposed solution is immigration. However, whether or not immigration is the key solution to the problem of ageing populations remains a debatable topic.\n\nImmigration can be a solution to the problem of ageing populations. Firstly, immigrants tend to be younger than the native population. As such, they can help to balance out the age demographics of a country. With a younger population, the economy would be better sustained as there would be a good balance of skilled and unskilled labour in the workforce. This would positively impact a country's economy and social welfare system.\n\nMoreover, immigration can also help to address the decline in birth rates. With a smaller number of births each year, a country's population inevitably shrinks as people age and pass away. Immigration can boost the population numbers, creating a greater workforce that can support the economy. Additionally, immigrants can contribute to the birth rate by having children in the country.\n\nHowever, some argue that immigration may not necessarily be the key solution to the problem of ageing populations. Firstly, it could lead to a lot of cultural challenges and conflicts as immigrants bring with them different traditions and values. Ageing populations are already faced with social problems resulting from a lack of understanding and acceptance of the population's diversity. Immigration could magnify the problem, resulting in more fractious communities.\n\nAdditionally, immigration policies could lead to an influx of unskilled immigrants, which could create more problems for a country. These immigrants might lack the necessary skills to support the economy adequately, or they might require significant social welfare. This would put lots of pressure on the country's resources, resulting in an even more severe problem than that of an ageing population.\n\nIn conclusion, while immigration can be a solution to the problem of ageing populations, it may not necessarily be the answer. It has its merits but also comes with potential challenges that could exacerbate the issues. Therefore, when considering immigration as a solution to the ageing population issue, policymakers need first to weigh its positive and negative aspects comprehensively, and develop pragmatic policies that will better serve the country in the long run."

                "prompt": "CONSIDER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HUMOUR IN OUR WORLD TODAY.",
                "response": "Humour is a much-valued aspect of our lives. It is often used as a coping mechanism during difficult times, and it is also used to provide entertainment. In fact, humour has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it has a significant impact on the world we live in. This essay will explore the significance of humour in our world today.\n\nFirstly, humour has the ability to bring people together. It can help to break down barriers and build relationships between individuals from different backgrounds. For example, political satire shows like \"Saturday Night Live\" in the United States have been known to bring people from opposing political views together by poking fun at politicians from all sides. This helps to bridge gaps and foster a sense of unity.\n\nSecondly, humour has the power to provide much-needed relief from stress and anxiety. In today's world, where people are often overworked and overwhelmed, humour provides a much-needed break from the grind of daily life. For example, memes and videos on social media platforms like Instagram and TikTok often go viral because they bring a smile to people's faces. This emotional relief helps people to cope better with their daily challenges.\n\nThirdly, humour is an effective means of social commentary. It provides a way for people to address and challenge social issues in a non-threatening manner. Comedians often use their routines to bring attention to issues like racism, sexism and inequality in a way that is both engaging and thought-provoking. This can lead to meaningful discussions and changes in attitudes and behaviours.\n\nHowever, it is worth noting that humour can also be harmful if used inappropriately. Humour that is distasteful, offensive or discriminatory has the potential to cause harm and perpetuate negative stereotypes and attitudes.\n\nIn conclusion, humour plays a significant role in our world today. It can bring people together, provide emotional relief and serve as a means of social commentary. However, it is important to use humour responsibly and thoughtfully to avoid causing harm. Therefore, we should appreciate the significance of humour in our daily lives and use it wisely."

                "prompt": "IS TECHNOLOGY THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF GLOBAL POVERTY?",
                "response": "Poverty has been a persistent issue that has plagued the world for many years. It has countless negative impacts on individuals, communities and the economy as a whole. With technology evolving at a rapid pace, there has been a growing argument that it can provide a solution to the problem of global poverty. In this essay, I will explore the potential of technology in addressing poverty, while also considering its limitations.\n\nTechnology has the potential to reduce poverty by increasing economic opportunities. For example, with the emergence of e-commerce, businesses can expand their reach beyond their immediate vicinity, reaching new customers across the globe. This has the potential to create jobs and generate income for people in impoverished regions. Additionally, technology such as mobile banking can significantly improve financial inclusion, making it easier for the underprivileged to access banking services, save money and borrow funds for business ventures.\n\nFurthermore, technology can improve access to education, which is crucial in breaking the cycle of poverty. Online platforms such as Coursera, Udemy and YouTube provide free or affordable access to education, meaning that people from all backgrounds can access high-quality learning materials. This can help individuals to gain valuable skills, opening up new paths for employment and entrepreneurship.\n\nDespite the potential of technology, it is not a silver bullet solution to poverty. Firstly, there is a significant digital divide between developed and developing nations. While developed countries have access to the latest technologies and high-speed internet, poorer regions may lack the necessary infrastructure for technological development. This means that access to technology is limited, and individuals in poorer regions may not be able to benefit from technological advancements.\n\nSecondly, the cost of technology may be prohibitive for individuals experiencing poverty. While smartphones and laptops can improve access to education, they may be too expensive for individuals to purchase without significant economic strain. This can create an educational divide between people who have access to technology and those who do not.\n\nFinally, technology can perpetuate existing inequalities. While it has the potential to provide new economic opportunities, it can also exacerbate income inequality by automating low-skilled jobs, leaving individuals without skills or resources in an even worse position.\n\nIn conclusion, technology can provide solutions to the problem of global poverty by providing access to education and economic opportunities. However, the digital divide, the high cost of technology, and the risk of exacerbating inequalities must be acknowledged and addressed. Technological development is not a panacea. It requires investment, cultural change, and targeted policy intervention. Only by developing appropriate policy responses can technology provide opportunities for people living in poverty."

                "prompt": "CONSIDER THE VIEW THAT FORMAL EDUCATION HAS DONE LITTLE TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR TODAY\"S CHALLENGES.",
                "response": "Formal education has been an essential part of modern society since it became compulsory in many countries. However, some argue that formal education has done little to prepare students for today's challenges. This essay will assess the validity of this view.\n\nFirstly, it can be argued that formal education does little to prepare students for the challenges faced in the modern world. This is because the curriculum is often outdated and not relevant to the present-day needs of society. Subjects such as history and literature are still taught in many schools, but may not be as useful in equipping students with the necessary skills to tackle contemporary challenges. For example, understanding algorithms and coding may be more beneficial than studying Shakespeare.\n\nHowever, others argue that formal education does prepare students for today's challenges. Students are taught a range of subjects, from mathematics to social studies, which trains them to think critically and analytically. These skills are transferable to many situations, including those that students may face in their future careers. Furthermore, formal education provides a solid foundation of knowledge and skills that can be built upon, giving students a platform from which to develop their own ideas and make a meaningful contribution to society.\n\nMoreover, formal education also teaches students essential life skills. These include time management, team collaboration, and effective communication, which are vital for success in the modern workforce. These skills are learned through formal education's focus on deadlines, group work, and presentation skills. These skills are highly valued by employers, and students who have honed them in a formal education setting are better equipped to handle the challenges of the modern world.\n\nIn conclusion, while some argue that formal education has done little to prepare students for today's challenges, this view is not entirely accurate. While there may be areas of formal education that are outdated, it is still an essential foundation for equipping students with crucial skills and knowledge. Formal education effectively prepares students for the challenges of the modern world by teaching them to think critically, develop essential life skills, and build a strong foundation of knowledge."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS THE TREND TOWARDS DIVERSITY A POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT?",
                "response": "Diversity has become a prominent trend in today's society. It refers to the inclusion of people from different backgrounds such as race, ethnicity, religion, gender and sexual orientation. While some argue it is a positive development, others disagree. This essay will discuss the extent to which the trend towards diversity is positive.\n\nFirstly, diversity contributes to a broader range of ideas and perspectives. When people with different backgrounds come together, they bring different ideas based on their experiences. This can lead to more creative and innovative solutions to problems. For example, a study conducted by McKinsey found that companies with diverse workforces are 35% more likely to have financial returns above their respective national medians than companies with less diversity.\n\nMoreover, diversity promotes cultural understanding and awareness. When people from different backgrounds work together, they learn about each other's cultures and customs. This can lead to greater respect and appreciation for different cultures, and help combat stereotypes and prejudices. For instance, Singapore is a multicultural society where people from different ethnic groups live together. This has led to a diverse food culture where people can enjoy different types of cuisine.\n\nHowever, some may argue that diversity can cause conflict and division. When people have different beliefs and values, conflicts may arise, especially in situations where resources are scarce. For example, two groups with different cultural beliefs may clash over land ownership. Furthermore, some may argue that diversity can reduce social cohesion as people may choose to associate only with those who share similar backgrounds.\n\nNevertheless, the benefits of diversity outweigh the drawbacks. Diversity fosters creativity and innovation, promotes cultural understanding, and contributes to a more inclusive society. It is important to recognize that diversity is not just about tolerance, but about embracing and celebrating differences.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity is a positive development. While there may be challenges, the benefits of diversity far outweigh its drawbacks. We should continue to promote diversity in all aspects of society to build a more inclusive and respectful community."

                "prompt": "CONSIDER THE VIEW THAT CITIES OF THE FUTURE NEED TO BE DESIGNED VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ONES WE KNOW TODAY.",
                "response": "As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, it has become apparent that cities need to evolve in order to accommodate the needs of their growing populations. Some argue that the cities of the future must undergo a radical restructuring in order to be sustainable, livable, and technologically advanced. This essay takes the view that cities of the future will need to be designed very differently from the ones we know today, by exploring some key reasons for this and potential innovative solutions.\n\nFirstly, the population density of many cities makes them vulnerable to congestion, air pollution, and inadequate facilities. To address these challenges in the future, cities will need to prioritize infrastructure and services that cater to public transportation, water and waste management, and sustainable energy. For example, the city of Copenhagen has made significant efforts to encourage cycling by building cycle lanes, pedestrian zones and traffic-free zones. This approach has helped increase cycling in the city while reducing air pollution and congestion.\n\nSecondly, the increasing use of technology and automation will require cities to redesign their physical space and infrastructure. With the rise of autonomous vehicles and smart homes, cities of the future will need to integrate smart technology into their infrastructure to improve safety and efficiency. For instance, in Singapore, autonomous vehicles are currently being tested and could potentially ease traffic congestion and improve public transportation services in the future.\n\nThirdly, the changing nature of work and lifestyle of people living in cities will require a different kind of urban design. With the ability to work remotely via digital technologies, cities may need to adapt to people's desire for flexible working arrangements and a healthier work-life balance. To achieve this, cities could embrace the idea of co-working spaces, communal areas and flexible working hours.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that designing cities of the future requires a significant shift in our current thinking and approach. Given the rapid pace of technological advancements that are reshaping the world, cities need to evolve to meet the needs of their current and future populations. This will involve prioritizing sustainable infrastructure, integrating smart technology, and reimagining the urban landscape in ways that promote livability and well-being. Only by doing this can we create cities that are truly sustainable, equitable and resilient."

                "prompt": "\"ENTERTAINMENT, NOT TRUTH, IS THE PRIORITY OF THE MEDIA TODAY,\" COMMENT.",
                "response": "The role of media in today's world is critical and often debated. The media has the power to shape public opinion and inform the masses. However, some people argue that the media focuses more on entertainment over truth. In my opinion, I agree that entertainment has become the priority of the media today rather than the truth.\n\nFirstly, the media's priority is to attract more viewership and increase revenue, which is best achieved through entertainment. People are more likely to watch or read something that is engaging, rather than hard-hitting news stories that can be overwhelming. For instance, reality shows, celebrity gossip, and sensational news get more viewership than in-depth political analysis or investigative journalism. This indicates that media's priority has shifted from reporting the truth to entertaining the audience.\n\nAdditionally, the rise of social media as a primary source of news has changed how media operates. Today, social media has become a business platform, with media outlets competing to get more likes, followers and shares. This has led to the use of click-bait headlines and sensational news designed to grab attention and increase engagement. The media has forgotten its primary role of reporting news accurately and truthfully.\n\nMoreover, media has become a tool for political propaganda and advertisement. The media outlets have become associated with politicians or corporate companies, and it is not unusual to see news being framed in favour of these affiliations. The truth has been buried under the veil of bias and incorrect information.\n\nTo conclude, the media has become more focused on entertainment over truth because it is the best way to increase viewership and generate revenue. We need to learn to differentiate between entertainment and news while consuming a piece of information. It is crucial for the media to understand its role and responsibilities. News is essential for driving change and shaping societal opinion, so it should be reported accurately and truthfully rather than as a form of entertainment."

                "prompt": "\"THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF RELIGION DID NOT EXIST.\" WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?",
                "response": "Religion has been a fundamental aspect of human society for centuries and has played an important role in shaping the culture, beliefs, and practices of people around the world. While it has brought a sense of community, faith, and guidance to the lives of millions, there are those who argue that the world would be a better place if religion did not exist. In my opinion, while religion has its flaws, it would be shortsighted to suggest that its absence would lead to a better world.\n\nTo begin with, religion has given people a sense of purpose and direction in life. It provides a moral compass, encourages people to lead a virtuous life, and gives them an understanding of what is right and wrong. This is particularly important in a world which often lacks clear ethical guidelines, and where people may be tempted to prioritize their self-interest over community good. Thus, without religion, there would be a high probability of moral and ethical beliefs being overlooked leading to a more chaotic world.\n\nMoreover, religion plays a significant role in offering people comfort and solace during trying times. It provides a sense of hope, particularly in moments of despair or grief, and allows individuals to find meaning and purpose in their struggles. In addition, religion can be seen as a source of inspiration and motivation for people to work towards a better future. For instance, religious leaders have played a significant role in driving positive change, such as Martin Luther King Jr and Mahatma Gandhi. Thus, to remove religion from society would be to deny people of the comfort, inspiration, and motivation it offers.\n\nHowever, it cannot be denied that religion has also been the cause of many conflicts and atrocities, with people using it to justify violence and promote intolerance. This is particularly true when religion is taken to the extreme, with certain sects or individuals promoting a dogmatic and rigid interpretation of their faith. These individuals or groups often turn into extremists who commit atrocities and spew hate. However, it is important to note that this is not an issue with religion itself, but rather, a problem with human interpretation and action.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is easy to dismiss the flaws and drawbacks of religion, it is important to acknowledge that its absence would be detrimental to society. Religion provides individuals with guidance, morals, and principles that are increasingly being eroded and underappreciated. Additionally, it has supported people in times of need and has motivated positive action. Therefore, while there are issues with religion, it remains an integral part of human society and culture."

                "prompt": "SHOULD GOVERNMENT POLICIES BE CONCERNED MAINLY WITH ECONOMIC GAINS? DISCUSS WITH PRIMARY REFERENCE TO YOUR COUNTRY.",
                "response": "The role of government policies has always been a controversial topic around the world. Some believe that the policies should focus mainly on achieving economic gains, while others argue that social welfare and environmental protection should be given equal importance. This essay will explore whether the government policies should be concerned mainly with economic gains, with primary reference to Singapore.\n\nFirstly, economic growth plays a significant role in any country's development. Economic gains boost the standard of living and generate employment opportunities, which contribute to a better quality of life for citizens. For instance, Singapore has been successful in achieving rapid economic growth and is currently one of the world\u2019s most prosperous nations, with a high GDP per capita, low unemployment rate and high living standards. This can be attributed to the government's strict policies and reforms focused on economic growth.\n\nHowever, prioritizing the economy over other sectors can lead to negative consequences. This can be seen in the situation of highly industrialized and developed nations where economic prosperity has come at the expense of environmental degradation and social injustice. It is essential to acknowledge that economic policies can create significant consequences beyond the economic sector. Neglecting the societal and environmental aspects can cause long-term damage and negatively impact the overall well-being of the society.\n\nIn Singapore, the government's policies do not concentrate primarily on economic gains. Singapore aims to achieve balance and harmony between economic growth, societal needs, and environmental sustainability. The government policies focus on creating a high-quality living environment, building a cohesive society and ensuring sustainable economic growth. For example, Singapore's government policies encourage businesses to adopt sustainable practices that have a favourable effect on the environment and enhances social welfare.\n\nTo sum up, government policies should not merely focus on economic gains but also consider social and environmental concerns. Economic growth is vital for a country's development, but it should not come at the expense of other essential aspects. In Singapore, the government's policies emphasize creating a more sustainable future by balancing economic growth with social welfare and environmental considerations, which will benefit future generations."

                "prompt": "\"YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.\" IS THIS TRUE OF YOUR COUNTRY?",
                "response": "In recent years, the phrase \"young people today have never had it so good\" has become increasingly prevalent. Some believe that young people in many countries, including Singapore, have enjoyed numerous benefits unparalleled in previous generations. However, this statement may not necessarily be true in the context of our country. In this essay, I will discuss why young people in Singapore are not as privileged as some may claim.\n\nFirst and foremost, Singapore's high cost of living can be a major challenge for many young people. While the wages of young professionals have increased in recent years, they have not kept pace with the ever-rising cost of housing and education. This may leave many young people struggling to make ends meet and unable to afford some of life's basic necessities.\n\nMoreover, young people in Singapore are facing intense competition in many areas. The pressure to perform academically is especially high, with a relentless focus on grades and achievement. This can result in increased anxiety and stress, as well as reduced opportunities for creative expression and personal growth.\n\nAnother factor that complicates the statement is the fast-changing nature of the world that young people are inheriting. As technological and global shifts continue to reshape the world, uncertainty and instability loom large. It may be difficult for young people to have the same sense of security and stability that previous generations felt.\n\nHowever, it would be unfair to say that young people in Singapore have no advantages or privileges. Technology, for example, has made life easier in many ways. With access to a wealth of information at their fingertips, young people in Singapore have unparalleled opportunities to learn and explore the world around them. Additionally, Singapore's focus on education and innovation is creating an ecosystem that fosters creativity and entrepreneurship. All of these have enriched the lives of young people in Singapore.\n\nOverall, while young people in Singapore may not have it as \"good\" as some may claim, it cannot be denied that they do enjoy certain advantages and privileges that previous generations did not. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge the challenges that they face, and to ensure that policies and initiatives are in place to help them succeed and thrive in an ever-changing world."

                "prompt": "\"GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES, WE SHOULD STOP TRYING TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT.\" WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS?",
                "response": "Environmental conservation has always been a crucial issue that has been heavily debated across the world. However, there are some who believe that the difficulties of saving the environment are too great, and therefore we should stop our efforts. This view, in my opinion, is not only short-sighted but also dangerous. Hence, I firmly believe that we should not stop trying to save the environment.\n\nFirstly, it is important to understand that saving the environment is not an easy task. It requires the collective efforts of every individual on this planet. However, just because a task is difficult does not mean that it is not worthwhile. Our planet is facing pressing environmental issues like climate change, deforestation, and pollution, which are endangering our planet and us. Therefore, it is our responsibility to take action, no matter how hard it may seem.\n\nYes, saving the environment is a daunting challenge, but it is not impossible. With time, we have seen the positive results of our efforts, such as a decrease in deforestation rates and an increase in the use of sustainable energy sources. It is clear that these efforts have borne fruit, and we must continue to push forward and find new ways to tackle the challenges that remain.\n\nMoreover, giving up on conservation efforts would have catastrophic effects. We have already seen the consequences of man-made environmental disasters, such as oil spills and toxic waste dumps. Without our ongoing efforts to save our planet, we would continue to face rising temperatures, increased natural disasters, and a lack of resources for future generations. Simply put, halting our conservation efforts would be a devastating mistake.\n\nIn conclusion, giving up on conservation efforts is not an option if we want to safeguard our planet's future. Our environmental issues will not solve themselves, and therefore, we need to work together to save our planet. Yes, saving the environment is challenging, but it is a challenge that we cannot afford to ignore. Thus, we must continue our efforts and explore new ways to tackle these problems. It is only by doing this that we can hope to create a brighter and safer future for all."

                "prompt": "\"SPORT UNITES MORE THAN IT DIVIDES\". HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?",
                "response": "Sports have been an integral part of human society since ages. They provide a platform for physical fitness, entertainment, and competition. Sport has also been known to bring people together, irrespective of their culture, language or religion. However, there is a debate on whether sport unites or divides individuals and communities. In my opinion, I agree that sport unites more than it divides, and will explore this further in the following paragraphs.\n\nTo begin with, sport has no language or cultural barrier. A sports event brings people from different countries and communities together, who are all united by their passion for a particular sport. For instance, the Olympic Games, which are held every four years, bring together athletes from all over the world, regardless of their nationalities, race and ethnicity. In this way, sport acts as a catalyst for social integration by encouraging people to interact with each other.\n\nMoreover, sport allows individuals to overcome their differences and work towards a common goal. In team sports such as football or basketball, players have to work together to achieve a victory. To accomplish this, they must put aside their differences and work in unity. This is because team members come from different backgrounds and may have different perspectives, but the common goal of winning the game unites them. Thus, sport is an excellent way to promote teamwork, cooperation and mutual respect among individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, there are instances where sport can cause division. For example, rivalries between teams and supporters can lead to violent clashes, which creates division. However, such incidents are sporadic and do not reflect the overall impact of sport on society. In most cases, the positive impact of sport in bringing people together outweighs the negatives.\n\nIn conclusion, despite some arguments to the contrary, sport unites more than it divides. Its ability to bring people together, regardless of their backgrounds, to work towards a common goal is essential in fostering unity globally. While there may be occasional rivalries between teams and supporters, it does not reflect the positive impact of sports. Therefore, it is essential that we appreciate the value of sport in promoting social integration, teamwork, and a spirit of cooperation and make it part of our daily life."

                "prompt": "IS THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY WORTHWHILE?",
                "response": "Privacy is a fundamental human right that has become increasingly important in this digital age. The protection of privacy is a debatable issue as it has both advantages and disadvantages. However, I strongly believe that the protection of privacy is worth it, and in this essay, I will explain why.\n\nFirstly, the protection of privacy is essential in safeguarding individual autonomy and freedom. Our personal information and choices are integral to our identity, and we should have the right to control who has access to them. Infringing on our privacy by disclosing our personal information without permission undermines our ability to make informed decisions and can even lead to the exploitation of individuals.\n\nFor example, when companies such as Facebook or Google collect personal data like our search history, location and online activities to monetize them, they are potentially violating our privacy rights, and exploiting our data for their profit-making purposes. This kind of exploitation should not be allowed as it threatens the morals of democracy and individual choice and reduces the autonomy of an individual.\n\nSecondly, privacy protection is critical in maintaining national security and safeguarding sensitive information. Sensitive information such as government documents, military strategies, and personal identification information is often targeted by hackers and this can have severe consequences. The government has a responsibility to ensure that citizens' privacy is protected, and to prevent foreign entities or malicious hackers from obtaining sensitive information. For instance, a lot depends on the privacy of crucial information like military strategies or government decisions.\n\nLastly, privacy protection is essential in protecting individuals from discrimination and prejudice. In case one's personal information gets in the wrong hands, it can be utilized in ways that violate their dignity and human rights. This creates a new avenue for discriminatory and unethical practices like racial profiling, biased hiring practices, and even blacklisting from social events. Privacy protection is, therefore, necessary to protect people from abusive practices.\n\nIn conclusion, privacy protection is worth fighting for in today\u2019s world. It directly impacts our autonomy, national security, and individual dignity. We should strive to guarantee our privacy, and maintain surveillance measures that are ethical and lawful, to prevent exploitation and safeguard our democracy."

                "prompt": "\"DIVERSITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY GLOBALIZATION SHOULD BE CELEBRATED, NOT FEARED.\" DISCUSS.",
                "response": "Globalization has had significant impacts on the world. One of such changes is the increase in diversity brought about by globalization. There is an ever-growing diversity of cultures, ideas, and people which has resulted in a more interconnected world. However, some argue that this diversity is negative and should be feared. Yet, it is essential that the diversity brought about by globalization should be celebrated.\n\nFirstly, diversity ensures that there is a free exchange of ideas, which can lead to progress and innovation. When people from various cultures come together, there is an opportunity to share knowledge and experience. For instance, various educational models and methods of teaching can be adopted to create a hybrid pedagogical model that is superior to any one method. This exchange of ideas not only leads to innovation but also allows for understanding and appreciation of different perspectives.\n\nSecondly, globalization has broken down barriers and has enabled people from different parts of the world to interact with each other. This has resulted in the creation of a more inclusive world that celebrates differences rather than fears them. Thanks to globalization, people can explore other cultures, discover new cuisines, and attend international festivals. This has enabled individuals to gain a better understanding of one another, break down stereotypes, and form long-lasting relationships.\n\nThirdly, globalization has opened up new opportunities and created a more interconnected world. By embracing diversity, individuals can capitalize on the opportunities created by globalization. When people from different cultures come together, new markets are created, new products are developed, and new services are offered. This opens up limitless possibilities and fosters economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, diversity should be celebrated, not feared. The diversity brought about by globalization allows for the exchange of ideas, the creation of a more inclusive world, and the opening up of new opportunities. Therefore, as a global community, we should embrace the diversity brought about by globalization and make the most of the opportunities created."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE THAT AS YOUR SOCIETY PROGRESSES, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HERITAGE?",
                "response": "As our society makes progress, there has been an ongoing debate about whether there is still a place for heritage. While some might argue that we should break free from the shackles of the past in order to move towards an utopian future, I strongly believe that preserving our heritage is crucial to our cultural identity and overall quality of life.\n\nFirstly, heritage is an integral part of our cultural identity. It reflects the ways in which our ancestors lived and the values that they upheld. The monuments, buildings, sculptures, and museums that we see around us today serve as powerful reminders of where we come from and how far we have come as a society. The preservation of our heritage helps us connect with our past, fostering a sense of appreciation and gratitude for those who came before us.\n\nFurthermore, heritage plays a significant role in the tourism industry. Heritage sites attract millions of visitors each year, providing a boost to local economies. This not only brings in revenue, but also gives visitors a glimpse into the rich cultural history of a place. For example, the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia attracts more than two million visitors each year, providing a significant economic boost to the country.\n\nMoreover, heritage sites can also serve as venues for community events and celebrations. For instance, the annual Thaipusam festival in Singapore sees thousands of devotees gather to worship at the Sri Thandayuthapani Temple, a site of national importance. Similarly, the Holi festival celebrated in India has become a global phenomenon and a symbol of the country's rich heritage and culture.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that heritage must not be treated as being immutable or static. Our understanding of heritage must evolve and change with time. As our society progresses, we must also seek to reinterpret and re-evaluate our heritage in a more inclusive and diverse way. It is imperative that we acknowledge the contributions of all cultures and communities, rather than just focusing on the dominant groups.\n\nIn conclusion, heritage plays a vital role in defining our cultural identity, driving tourism, and fostering community spirit. As our society continues to make progress, it is necessary that we preserve our heritage and embrace it in a more inclusive and diverse manner. We must find a way to balance progress and modernity with the need to preserve our past, so that future generations can also have a sense of connection with their cultural roots."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE THAT SCIENCE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RELIGION?",
                "response": "Science and religion are two distinct domains that have always coexisted in human society. While science concerns itself with empirical evidence and observation, religion is more about faith and belief in a higher power. The debate about which is more important has always been a contentious one, with opinions divided. In my opinion, science is more crucial than religion, and in the following paragraphs, I shall elaborate on my point.\n\nTo begin with, science can provide us with concrete evidence to support its claims. The scientific method involves rigorous experimentation and analysis of data, and this helps to mitigate the scope for error and bias. Religious beliefs, on the other hand, are often based on faith, tradition, or revelation, which can be open to interpretation and are not always backed up by evidence.\n\nFor example, consider the theory of evolution, which is firmly rooted in science. The discovery of fossils, the genetic make-up of living organisms, and the study of geography have all confirmed the theory of evolution. In contrast, religious creation stories about the origin of life lack conclusive evidence to support the claims made within them.\n\nMoreover, science is vital to human progress. Scientific advancements have revolutionized various fields, such as medicine, technology, and transportation. Science enables us to overcome adversity, discover new ways of solving problems, and understand the world around us. On the other hand, religion, while significant to many people, cannot replace the tangible benefits that science provides.\n\nFor instance, the invention of antibiotics has saved countless lives that may have been lost to infections that were previously incurable. Without science, we would not have achieved the technological advancements that have improved our quality of life. While religion provides comfort and guidance for some people, it cannot match the leaps and bounds that science has made in advancing humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, while religion and science may be important in their respective ways, science is undoubtedly more critical in the modern world. With its emphasis on evidence-based research, progress, and innovative thinking, science has the potential to transform human society for the better. Therefore, as we move forward, it is essential to place a greater emphasis on science and its achievements."

                "prompt": "IS CHANGE ALWAYS GOOD?",
                "response": "Change is a constant in life, and it affects us all at some point. It can happen on many levels, from our personal lives to our society and the world at large. However, whether change is always good or not is a subject of debate. In my view, change can be beneficial or detrimental, depending on the circumstances, and it is essential to evaluate its potential outcomes before proceeding.\n\nFirstly, change can be positive if it leads to progress and improvement. For example, advancements in technology such as the internet have brought significant benefits to our lives, making it easier for people to connect and access information. Similarly, changes in medical treatments and procedures have led to longer lifespans and better health outcomes. These examples of change have clearly demonstrated that, when done right, change can bring significant benefits.\n\nHowever, change can also have negative consequences. For instance, rapid urbanization may lead to a decline in air and water quality, leading to health issues for the people living in such areas. Furthermore, changes in the economy such as job losses and decreased job security can lead to significant stresses and social problems. Therefore, change must be carefully planned and executed to ensure its benefits outweigh any downsides.\n\nAnother aspect to consider is how change affects individuals and societies differently. For example, legislation that allows for same-sex marriage and equal rights has been a positive change for the LGBTQ+ community. Still, it has not necessarily been welcomed by all sectors of society. In contrast, changes such as a new tax regime or the removal of a popular attraction can cause anger and frustration among the public, even if the changes are necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, change can have both positive and negative effects, and it is essential to consider potential outcomes before proceeding. While progress and improvement are desirable, change must be made thoughtfully and carefully. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate change's effects on individuals, society, and the economy to determine whether it is genuinely beneficial."

                "prompt": "Science will always have noble intentions.' Discuss.",
                "response": "Science is a field that is constantly advancing and contributing to the betterment of society in various ways. It has given rise to numerous innovations, cures for diseases and technological advancements, to name a few. However, science can also be used for less noble purposes like developing weapons or experimenting on animals. Nonetheless, it can be argued that science will always have noble intentions at its core.\n\nScience operates on the principles of observation, experimentation and analysis. Scientists aim to uncover the mysteries of the world around us and to find solutions to various problems that affect humanity. This pursuit of knowledge is undoubtedly a noble intention. Through science, we have achieved great milestones in areas such as healthcare, agriculture and energy, hence improving the quality of life for people globally.\n\nMoreover, science has a desire to promote equitable and sustainable development. Advances in science and technology can be used to bridge gaps between developed and developing nations by providing solutions to social and environmental challenges. For instance, scientists may research new ways to decrease pollution, alleviate poverty and enhance education. Their research may also encourage sustainable practices by promoting environmentally friendly methods and materials.\n\nAdditionally, ethical considerations are taken seriously in scientific research. There are strict guidelines and regulations that scientists must adhere to in their investigations, especially those involving human and animal subjects. These guidelines ensure that research is conducted with respect, integrity and accountability.\n\nDespite the many benefits of science, it is not perfect, and there may be instances when science is exploited for harmful purposes. For instance, in the past, science has been used to develop nuclear weapons and to justify inhumane experiments on living beings. However, it is important to note that these actions are not a reflection of science itself but of those who choose to misuse it. \n\nIn conclusion, science does have noble intentions, which are geared towards finding solutions to problematic issues facing humanity and to make the world a better place. While it is possible that science can be used for undesirable purposes, it is not a reason to discredit the field as a whole. As society continues to support ethical and sustainable science, it will remain a valuable tool for societal development and progress."

                "prompt": "There are certain things that the media have the responsibility not to report.' Discuss.",
                "response": "The media plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and holding those in power accountable. However, with great power comes great responsibility. In some cases, there are certain things that the media have the responsibility not to report. This essay will explore some of these cases and why they are necessary.\n\nFirstly, the media should not report details of ongoing police investigations. Reporting such details could compromise the police investigations, and potentially jeopardize the safety of those involved. Furthermore, it could also result in wrongful accusations of innocent parties. For instance, if the media were to report alleged suspects and their details, the public may take matters into their own hands and subject the suspects to vigilante justice.\n\nAnother situation where the media should exercise restraint is when it comes to reporting on individuals' mental health. While it's important to encourage people to seek help and reduce the stigma around mental health, disclosing the mental health issues of a particular individual can be detrimental. This will not only invade their privacy and dignity but also affect their personal and professional life.\n\nIn addition to this, confidentiality should also be maintained when it comes to reporting on sensitive information, such as personal or national security. If certain information is leaked to the public, it could cause panic, national security risks, and even loss of lives. This is a delicate matter, and journalists should take care to report news in a responsible manner that does not endanger lives or harm national security.\n\nLastly, the media should not report rumours or unconfirmed information. Journalists must ensure that they verify the accuracy of their news to avoid causing panic or spreading falsehoods. Spreading baseless rumours can create panic, anxiety, and unrest, which can impact society as a whole.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's essential for the media to play their role in society, there are certain things that they have the responsibility not to report on, such as details of ongoing police investigations, individuals' mental health issues, sensitive information, and unconfirmed rumours. It is essential for journalists and news outlets to maintain standards of accuracy, integrity, and sensitivity when reporting on sensitive or private matters."

                "prompt": "'The key criterion for good government is how well the economy is managed.' Is this is fair assessment?",
                "response": "The management of the economy is undoubtedly a critical aspect of governance. However, it is only one criterion among several, in assessing the performance of a government. In this essay, I will discuss the importance of a well-managed economy as a criterion for good governance, as well as other factors that need to be considered when assessing the effectiveness of a government.\n\nFirst and foremost, a well-managed economy is vital for a government to consistently provide for the needs of its people. A stable and growing economy creates job opportunities, generates revenue for social programs, and enhances the quality of life for citizens. For instance, in Singapore, the government's efficient management of the economy has enabled it to invest heavily in education, healthcare, and housing, all of which have significant benefits for the populace.\n\nHowever, there are other factors that must be considered in assessing whether a government is performing well or not. One such factor is the degree of transparency and accountability of its leaders. A transparent government ensures that citizens are fully aware of what the government is doing and how it is using taxpayers' money. This transparency helps to reduce corruption and also builds trust between the government and its people. For instance, countries like Denmark and Finland which consistently rank highly in the Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index have fewer incidences of corruption and embezzlement by government officials.\n\nAnother important criterion is the government's ability to uphold civil and human rights. A good government should prioritize the welfare and safety of its citizens while also safeguarding their fundamental rights and freedoms. The ability to prioritize such rights protects citizens from potential abuses of power that might occur.\n\nIt is also important to consider the government's ability to govern effectively and democratically as a criterion for good governance. This includes the ability of the government to work constructively with opposition parties, to listen and respond to citizen concerns, and to proactively evaluate its own actions for their effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, while managing the economy is a critical factor in assessing a government's performance, it must be noted that this is only one aspect of good governance. Other factors such as transparency, accountability, upholding of civil and human rights, as well as effective governance, are equally essential. Therefore, it is vital for governments to strive for success in all these areas to provide the best possible service to their citizens."

                "prompt": "Is there a more urgent need for religion in today's world?",
                "response": "Religion, throughout history, has played a crucial role in shaping human society. However, in today's world, with the advancement of science and technology, scientific achievements and rational thinking have started replacing the age-old religious beliefs. Therefore, it is a pertinent question to ask whether there is a more urgent need for religion in today's world. In this essay, we will analyze whether there is a genuine requirement for religion in the modern world.\n\nFirstly, one significant advantage of religion is that it helps individuals to find meaning and purpose in life. Religion offers a set of beliefs and principles that can guide people in their everyday lives and provide a sense of direction and purpose. For example, many people find solace in their religious beliefs during times of personal crises, as they believe that they are not alone and that there is a higher power that would guide them. Religion, therefore, can act as a source of strength and hope, especially in times of emotional and physical distress.\n\nFurthermore, religion can also contribute to the development of moral values and ethical principles. Most religions have a strong moral code that outlines the dos and don'ts of human behavior. For example, the Ten Commandments of Christianity and Islam emphasize the values of honesty, integrity, and respect for one another. Such values form the foundation of a just and equitable society, and it is essential that we instill these values in our daily lives.\n\nHowever, there are also certain disadvantages of religion. One significant drawback is that religion is often divisive and can lead to conflict and violence. History bears witness to several wars and conflicts that were triggered due to religious differences. In today's world, there are numerous examples of religious intolerance and extremism, which pose a significant threat to global peace and stability. Therefore, it is essential that we promote religious tolerance and understanding to prevent such conflicts from arising.\n\nIn conclusion, religion can play a significant role in providing individuals with a sense of purpose, guiding moral behavior, and promoting social harmony. However, it is also essential that we acknowledge the potential drawbacks of religion, such as religious intolerance and extremism, and work towards promoting religious understanding and tolerance in the global community. Hence, there is a genuine need for religion in today's world, but we need to ensure that it is harnessed positively and not used to create divisions or incite conflicts."

                "response": "In the present era, technology has become a pillar of human civilization. It has indeed revolutionized the way we communicate, work, and interact with the world. Today, many global problems threaten the survival of mankind, such as climate change, the spread of diseases, poverty, and social inequality. Some believe that technology is the ultimate solution to all these issues, while others are skeptical about its effectiveness. In my opinion, I firmly agree that technology is the key to solving major issues facing mankind today.\n\nTo begin with, technology has the power to mitigate the effects of climate change. For instance, renewable energy technologies such as solar panels, wind turbines, and hydropower systems are increasingly being used to generate electricity, thus reducing our reliance on fossil fuels. In addition, advanced materials and manufacturing technologies have enabled us to produce eco-friendly products that have minimal environmental impact. For instance, electric cars are becoming increasingly popular since they emit fewer greenhouse gases compared to traditional automobiles.\n\nFurthermore, technology has played a crucial role in healthcare, especially in the fight against infectious diseases. For example, with the aid of technology, scientists and researchers were able to develop vaccines and treatments for deadly viruses such as Covid-19 within record time. Additionally, telemedicine and online consultations have transformed the way patients interact with their doctors, becoming more convenient and cost-effective.\n\nMoreover, technology has the ability to address social inequality by providing equal opportunities for all. The internet has enabled people around the world to access education and training irrespective of their geographical location. Consequently, this has led to the democratization of education and has provided people with the skills they need to contribute to the growth and development of their society.\n\nIn conclusion, technology is an essential tool that can help humanity address some of its most pressing challenges today. Its potential to mitigate the effects of climate change, improve healthcare, and address social inequality cannot be ignored. However, it is important to note that technology is not a silver bullet solution to all issues, it requires careful and responsible management to ensure it benefits all of humanity."

                "response": "Libraries have been an important part of society for centuries. However, with the rise of digital technology and easy access to online information, one might wonder whether libraries are still relevant today. While it is true that the internet has made it easier to access information, libraries remain a valuable resource for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirstly, libraries offer much more than just books. They provide access to a wide range of resources, including digital archives, research papers, and historical documents, which cannot be found on the internet. Furthermore, librarians are trained professionals who can help guide research and ensure that the information being obtained is trustworthy. This assistance can be invaluable, especially for students who may not have access to expensive academic resources.\n\nMoreover, libraries play a crucial role in promoting literacy and fostering a love of reading. While it is true that e-books and audiobooks are more readily available than ever before, physical books continue to hold significant cultural value. Visiting the library allows readers to engage with physical books, be exposed to new authors and genres, and connect with a community of like-minded individuals.\n\nIn addition to these benefits, libraries are also essential for promoting equality. Not everyone has access to the internet or possesses the financial means to purchase books or other educational resources. Libraries provide an open and accessible space for anyone to access knowledge and information, regardless of economic status. This is vital in promoting social mobility and addressing inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, while the internet has undoubtedly made it easier to access information, it is important not to underestimate the continued importance of libraries in our society. They provide invaluable resources, promote literacy and foster a sense of community, and offer an equalising space for access to information. As such, it is clear that libraries remain relevant in today's world and will continue to play an important role in the future."

                "prompt": "Is democracy, as is often assumed, often the best?",
                "response": "Democracy is a system of government where the power is vested in the people, who in turn elect representatives who govern according to the will of the people. While democracy is often hailed as the best system of government, it is not always the ideal solution for all nations. In this essay, I will explore the advantages and disadvantages of democracy and how it may not always be the best system of government.\n\nFirstly, democracy allows for fair representation of the people's interests. In a democratic government, all citizens have an equal say and all voices are heard. This is essential in ensuring that the citizens' needs and wants are met. For example, in Singapore's democratic society, citizens are allowed to vote for leaders who they believe will best represent them in Parliament.\n\nHowever, democracy can also lead to gridlock and stagnation. In cases where there are divided views, it can be difficult to make decisions that suit everyone. This can lead to inefficient governance, where policies are not formed or implemented quickly. Many Western democracies are currently facing this issue, where partisan politics have made it difficult for governments to make meaningful progress.\n\nAnother disadvantage of democracy is that it can lead to the \"tyranny of the majority\". In a democratic system, the majority has the power to control the government and make decisions, often at the expense of minority groups. This can lead to policies that may be damaging to certain segments of society, which can ferment dissent and unrest. For example, the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar is a result of the discrimination of the Rohingya Muslim minority by the majority Buddhist population.\n\nLastly, democracy may not be the most suitable system of government for nations that lack a certain level of civic maturity and stability. In countries where corruption and cronyism are rampant, a democratic government may be difficult to achieve. In these cases, a more authoritarian approach may be necessary in order to establish social order and unity.\n\nIn conclusion, while democracy may be the best system of government in many cases, it is not always the most suitable solution for all nations. It is important to recognise the advantages and disadvantages of democracy, and to understand that it is not a one-size-fits-all approach to governance. As Singaporeans, it is vital that we continue to work towards building and maintaining a robust democratic system that serves the needs and interests of all its people."

                "prompt": "Is foreign intervention justified?",
                "response": "Foreign intervention refers to the intervention of one country into the affairs of another for various reasons. There are reasons for and against foreign intervention, and the topic of its justification has been debated among politicians, academics, and people worldwide. In my opinion, foreign intervention is not always justified and should only take place under certain circumstances.\n\nOne argument for foreign intervention is to protect human rights. Countries have a responsibility to protect their citizens from harm and to ensure their safety and basic rights. However, many countries are unable or unwilling to protect their citizens, and in these cases, foreign intervention can be justified to prevent human rights abuses. For example, the intervention of NATO forces in Kosovo in 1999 was to stop the Serbians from committing widespread ethnic cleansing against Albanian Muslims.\n\nDespite that, foreign intervention can also have negative consequences. Firstly, it may violate the sovereignty of the country being intervened in. Countries have the right to govern themselves without interference from other countries. Secondly, foreign intervention may create more harm than good. For example, the Iraq War in 2003 led to the death of thousands of civilians and destabilized the country, making it more vulnerable to terrorist groups.\n\nIf foreign intervention is necessary, it must be carried out with caution and in a measured manner. It should be done in collaboration with the international community and with the approval of the United Nations, whenever possible. The intervention should also have a clear objective and exit strategy, and it should be focused on protecting human rights or resolving a conflict.\n\nIn conclusion, while foreign intervention may be necessary in certain cases, it should not be seen as a solution to every problem. The consequences of foreign intervention can be far-reaching and severe. It should only occur under certain circumstances and be approached with caution. Ultimately, the international community should work towards creating a world where foreign intervention is unnecessary, and countries can work together to resolve conflicts diplomatically."

                "prompt": "Should a good government always protect the interests of the majority?",
                "response": "The role of a government is to protect the welfare of its people and ensure that the nation is managed effectively. One of the most important considerations for governments is ensuring that the interests of the majority are upheld. However, some argue that a good government should also consider and balance the interests of minorities. In this essay, I will argue that while a good government should generally protect the interests of the majority, it is also important to consider the interests of minorities.\n\nFirstly, protecting the interests of the majority is important for maintaining social harmony and stability. The majority represents a significant portion of society and their interests typically align with the overall goals of the nation. A government that neglects the interests of the majority risks creating social unrest and political instability. For example, if a government fails to address rising unemployment or inflation, it may lead to protests and civil unrest, which can disrupt the functioning of society.\n\nHowever, it is essential for a good government to also consider the interests of minorities. Protecting the interests of minorities is vital in promoting social justice and equality. Minorities are often disadvantaged and may face discrimination, and it is necessary for a government to ensure that their rights and interests are protected. For example, a government may need to implement policies to protect the rights of ethnic or religious minorities, or to provide assistance to individuals with disabilities.\n\nMoreover, there are instances where the interests of minorities align with the long-term interests of the nation. In such cases, a government should prioritize the interests of the minority over the immediate interests of the majority. For example, if a government is considering a policy that will harm the environment, environmental groups may be a minority, but their interests represent the long-term welfare of the entire nation.\n\nIn conclusion, a good government should prioritize the interests of the majority but should also consider the interests of minorities. Protecting the interests of the majority helps to maintain social stability while prioritizing the interests of minorities promotes social justice and equality. A government should also recognize that there may be instances where minority interests align with the long-term interests of the nation and prioritize them accordingly. Ultimately, a responsible and effective government should strive to create a society that balances the interests of all its citizens."

Moreover, countries like China and South Korea, which have allocated a significant portion of their annual budgets to education initiatives, have seen an impressive boost in their economies and a reduction in poverty rates.\n\nLastly, education builds social harmony. By providing education, governments can ensure that everyone has the same opportunities regardless of social or economic status. In this way, education promotes inclusivity and fosters empathy and understanding between different races, religions and social classes. This is vital in maintaining social harmony and preventing social unrest. Norway's education system, for example, instills the values of equality, tolerance and respect. Norway is one of the most peaceful societies with low crime rates, proving that education has a role in creating a harmonious society.\n\nIn conclusion, education is an essential tool for personal development, economic growth and social harmony. Therefore, governments must invest in education to ensure it remains a top priority. The benefits of education are limitless and long-lasting, and it is imperative that governments recognise its importance to improve the lives of citizens and promote progress and advancement."

This period saw Singapore transformed from a small trading port to a modern and prosperous city-state that we know today.\n\nIn the post-World War II era, Singapore was still a British colony. The economy was in a dire state, and unemployment was high. The government was also ill-equipped to handle the situation, and there was a lack of infrastructure in the country.\n\nHowever, despite the challenges, Singapore was able to make significant progress. The government implemented policies to encourage foreign investment, and this led to the growth of the manufacturing and services sectors. The establishment of the Economic Development Board (EDB) was a game-changer, as it helped attract multinational corporations to set up their bases in Singapore.\n\nOne of the most significant events during this period was the merger between Singapore and Malaysia. This was a monumental moment in the history of Singapore, as it was envisioned to be the start of a prosperous and united Malaysia. However, the merger was short-lived, and Singapore became an independent nation a few years later.\n\nThe post-World War II era also saw the rise of Singapore's founding father, Lee Kuan Yew. He was a visionary leader who was determined to transform Singapore from a Third World country to a First World country. He implemented policies such as the Speak Mandarin Campaign, the Clean Singapore Campaign, and the construction of public housing. These policies helped to create a sense of national identity and a better living environment for Singaporeans.\n\nIn conclusion, the post-World War II era in Singapore's history appeals to me because it was a time of great transformation. Despite the challenges, Singapore was able to overcome its obstacles, and this period paved the way for Singapore's success in the future. The period also saw the leadership of Lee Kuan Yew, whose legacy continues to shape Singapore today."

                "prompt": "The world is fast becoming a global village. Assess the impact of this on Singapore.",
                "response": "The phrase \"global village\" refers to the idea that the world is becoming more interconnected and interdependent through advances in technology, transportation, and communication. As a small island nation heavily reliant on international trade and investment, Singapore has been significantly impacted by this trend. In this essay, I will assess the impact of the world becoming a global village on Singapore.\n\nFirstly, the global village has greatly facilitated Singapore's role as a hub for international business and finance. With the ease of communication and travel, businesses can now easily connect with partners and customers from all around the world. Singapore's strategic location and business-friendly policies have attracted numerous multinational corporations, which has helped to boost its economy. For example, the Singapore Exchange (SGX) is now the largest foreign exchange centre in Asia outside Japan, thanks to its ability to tap into global financial markets.\n\nSecondly, the global village has brought about a diverse range of cultural influences to Singapore. In the past, Singapore's culture was primarily influenced by its Southeast Asian roots. However, with the ease of travel, immigration, and digital media, Singaporeans are now exposed to diverse cultures and lifestyles from all around the world. This has greatly enriched Singapore's cultural landscape, making it one of the most cosmopolitan cities in Asia. For instance, Singapore's diverse food scene, which features cuisines from all around the world, has become a major attraction for tourists.\n\nHowever, the global village has also brought about challenges and competitions for Singapore. With the ease of trade and investment, Singapore now faces stiff competition from neighbouring countries such as Malaysia and Indonesia, which are also trying to attract foreign businesses and capital. This has spurred Singapore to constantly improve its business environment and infrastructure to remain competitive.\n\nLastly, the global village has also brought about environmental concerns for Singapore. As a small, densely-populated island, Singapore is vulnerable to the impacts of global environmental issues such as climate change and pollution. Singapore has had to adopt a proactive approach in addressing these issues, implementing policies such as carbon taxes and investing in sustainable energy sources.\n\nIn conclusion, the world becoming a global village has had a significant impact on Singapore. While it has brought about many benefits such as boosting its economy and cultural diversity, it has also brought about challenges and environmental concerns. Nonetheless, it is clear that Singapore will continue to adapt and evolve, as it strives to remain competitive and relevant in this interconnected world."

                "prompt": "Choose a sport and account for its popularity in your country",
                "response": "Football, also known as soccer, is one of the most popular sports in Singapore. Football is enjoyed by Singaporeans of all ages, and it is played both recreationally and professionally. In this essay, I will account for the popularity of football in Singapore.\n\nFirstly, Singapore has a strong football culture. Football has been played in Singapore since the colonial period, and it has since become a national pastime. Singapore has a national football team, which represents the country in international competitions. The team has had some success, winning the ASEAN Football Championship four times. This has helped to increase the popularity of the sport as Singaporeans have a national team to support.\n\nSecondly, football is accessible to everyone. It is a sport that requires few resources to play, and it can be played anywhere. All you need is a ball, a few friends, and a playing field, which could be just a patch of grass. Therefore, football is a sport that can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life regardless of social status or background.\n\nThirdly, the sport is widely covered in both traditional and social media. Singaporean football fans can keep up to date with the latest news, scores, and highlights through social media platforms like Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. They can also follow local and international leagues on cable television channels like STAR Sports, Fox Sports, and Singtel TV.\n\nLastly, football is a sport that is full of excitement and emotion. Football matches are filled with drama, intense competition, and upsets. The thrill of scoring a goal or winning a game can make fans feel euphoric, and this can lead to celebrations that unite communities and bring people together.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several reasons why football is so popular in Singapore. These include the country's strong football culture, the accessibility of the sport, media coverage, and the excitement and emotion that it provides. Football has become a part of Singapore's identity and will continue to be a beloved sport for generations to come."

                "prompt": "Would you plan the layout of your neighbourhood differently?",
                "response": "As an inhabitant of a neighbourhood, the place where I live and interact with my community, I am of the view that the layout of my neighbourhood could be improved. In this essay, I will elaborate on the reasons why I think so.\n\nTo begin with, the current layout of my neighbourhood does not seem to encourage neighbourliness. There are no common spaces where residents can gather and bond, and the houses are often too close to one another, leaving limited spaces between them. For instance, if there are no parks, community centers, or sports venues, neighbours will likely not interact, and the sense of community will be lost. A redesign of the neighbourhood layout should focus on creating these spaces where people can come together to play, exercise, and get to know each other.\n\nAdditionally, the current layout of my neighbourhood prioritizes cars over pedestrians. The streets in most parts of the neighbourhood are too wide, making it challenging for people on foot to cross. Consequently, residents may feel unsafe or opt to take their cars to short distances instead of walking. After all, the design of a neighbourhood should ensure that it is safe and comfortable to walk and cycle. This can result in reduced air pollution and promote healthier lifestyles. It is thus necessary to incorporate more pedestrian lanes, speed bumps, and well-marked crossings in our neighbourhood.\n\nMoreover, traditional designs may not meet the present and future needs of the community. For example, as the population density grows, there is an increased demand for smaller and affordable homes that are still spacious enough. Older neighbourhoods may have some oversized houses and lots that can be repurposed for more modest homes for those on a lower income. This would result in more affordable housing and a healthier social mix in the community.\n\nIn conclusion, a neighbourhood is a community that consists of residents connected by a shared sense of belonging. While the current layout of my neighbourhood possesses some benefits, its drawbacks make it necessary for a redesign that prioritizes pedestrian safety, connection of residents, and suitability to present and future needs. I believe that if there were more opportunities for connectivity within our neighbourhood, it would strengthen our sense of community and make it a more vibrant and pleasant place to live and grow."

                "prompt": "Do books have a future?",
                "response": "Books have been an integral part of human civilization for centuries, providing knowledge, entertainment, and mental stimulation. However, in the digital age, with the emergence of e-books, audiobooks, and other digital media, the future of books has become a topic of debate. In this essay, I will argue that books still have a future and remain a valuable medium for human communication and expression.\n\nFirstly, books offer a unique sensory experience that digital media cannot replicate. The tactile sensation of turning a page, the smell of paper and ink, and the weight of the book in hand all add to the reading experience. Moreover, reading a physical book offers a break from the screen-centric lifestyle that many people lead, allowing for relaxation and mindfulness.\n\nSecondly, books provide a lasting record of human knowledge and culture. While digital media can be ephemeral and subject to corruption or loss, books have been shown to last for hundreds of years when cared for properly. This means that books can continue to be passed down through generations, preserving our collective history and wisdom.\n\nThirdly, books are accessible to everyone, regardless of their socioeconomic status or access to technology. Public libraries, which provide free access to books, remain a cornerstone of communities around the world. In contrast, access to e-books or digital audiobooks may require a subscription fee or access to expensive technology.\n\nLastly, books stimulate mental and emotional growth in a way that digital media cannot. For example, studies have shown that reading books improves focus, concentration, and analytical skills, which are becoming increasingly important in today's competitive and fast-paced world. Additionally, books can evoke emotional responses in readers, such as empathy, compassion, and a greater understanding of the human condition.\n\nIn conclusion, books still have a future as a valuable medium for human communication and expression. Physical books offer a unique sensory experience, provide a lasting record of our knowledge and culture, remain accessible to all, and stimulate mental and emotional growth. While digital media may continue to evolve and offer new forms of entertainment and communication, the value of books should not be underestimated or overshadowed."

                "prompt": "With so many books being make into film today, is it still necessary to read?",
                "response": "In our modern world, it is indisputable that many books have been made into movies. This has led some to wonder if it is still necessary to read. However, I strongly believe that reading is still essential for several reasons.\n\nFirstly, reading helps in developing one's imagination and creativity. Unlike movies, where everything is depicted visually, reading allows readers to create their own mental images of characters and the settings in a book. This can be beneficial as it helps to stimulate the brain's ability to be creative and think critically.\n\nFurthermore, reading has many extra benefits that watching films does not. For example, reading improves one's vocabulary and grammar skills naturally. This, in turn, can help to enhance communication and writing abilities. Reading can also contribute to improved comprehension as it requires readers to imagine and construe the sequence of events in a book. These skills can aid in academic performance and overall cognitive development.\n\nAdditionally, books often offer more comprehensive and detailed storytelling than films. A movie usually lasts between 90 minutes to 2 hours, while books can provide more profound character development and more in-depth storytelling that movies need to leave out to fit within the limited time of the film.\n\nFinally, reading can be an enjoyable pastime and used to alleviate stress or boredom during free time. Reading can transport people to far-off lands, different times or even fictional universes, allowing them to unwind, disconnect and escape everyday reality entirely.\n\nTo conclude, while it is true that many books have been made into films, reading remains an integral part of our lives. Reading strengthens our imagination and creativity, improves vocabulary and language skills, and often provides a more immersive storytelling experience.  Therefore, we should continue to encourage reading as a pleasurable and productive activity."

                "prompt": "Reading fiction may be entertaining but otherwise it has little real value. Discuss.",
                "response": "Fictional books are often thought of as a source of entertainment rather than as a source of knowledge and understanding. While it's true that reading fiction can be very enjoyable, it is far from being devoid of value in real life. In this essay, I will discuss the role and importance of fiction in our lives.\n\nFirstly, fiction can offer valuable insight into the human experience. Through works of fiction, readers can gain an understanding of the complexities of human relationships, the emotions that drive us, and the struggles we face on a daily basis. This insight can help readers develop greater empathy and better navigate their own lives. For example, in the novel \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee, the injustice faced by a black man accused of a crime he did not commit highlights the racial prejudice that still exists in society. This allows readers to gain a deeper understanding and empathy towards those who have been victims of discrimination.\n\nSecondly, reading fiction can improve cognitive abilities such as creativity and critical thinking. Fictional works often require readers to think deeply about characters and themes and make connections between them. This kind of critical thinking can help readers develop their own analytical skills and enhance their creativity. For instance, the works of science fiction by Isaac Asimov promote creative thinking and problem-solving skills as they offer the possibility to think about hypothetical situations in a futuristic world.\n\nFurthermore, beyond the cognitive benefits of fiction, it can also be of practical value. Reading stories can help readers better understand different cultures and more adept in articulating their own thoughts and feelings. For example, when a reader is exposed to an unfamiliar culture through books, they are better equipped to navigate their way through a new environment and communicate with people belonging to that culture.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that fiction is often viewed as mainly entertaining, it is far from being devoid of value. The value of fiction spans from offering a deeper insight into the human experience, improving cognitive abilities and skills, to practical application in our daily lives. Therefore, it is important for people to read more works of fiction and realize the depth of knowledge and wisdom it can provide."

                "prompt": "Telling lies can never be justified. Do you agree?",
                "response": "Lying has always been a topic of great ethical dilemma. Some people believe that lying can be justified in certain situations, while others argue that it is never acceptable. In my opinion, I strongly believe that telling lies can never be justified.\n\nFirstly, telling lies goes against the fundamental principle of honesty. Honesty is a universal value that is an integral part of human society. It forms the basis of trust in interpersonal relationships, and even in the business world. When people lie, they are breaking the trust that exists between them and the other person. This can create a serious dent in their relationship and can lead to long-term damage.\n\nFurthermore, telling lies often creates more problems than it solves. When people lie, they have to remember the lie they told, which can be challenging. They often get caught up in their lies and end up telling more lies to cover up. This can lead to a web of lies that can be very hard to untangle. Additionally, telling a lie can also hurt others, as they may base their decisions or actions on that lie, which can later result in adverse consequences.\n\nLastly, telling lies can undermine one's moral values and beliefs. It can lead to feelings of guilt and shame and can cause an erosion of self-esteem. People who lie frequently may end up becoming compulsive liars, which is a significant psychological disorder. It can also lead to a loss of respect from one's peers and family and ultimately result in social isolation.\n\nIn conclusion, telling lies is never justified, regardless of the situation. It goes against the fundamental values of honesty and can create more problems than it solves. It can also lead to the erosion of one's moral values and result in social isolation. Therefore, it is important to be truthful, even in the most challenging situations. It is only through honesty that we can build strong relationships and create a better world."

                "prompt": "Longevity is a blessing. Comment.",
                "response": "Longevity is the ability to live for an extended period of time, and it is considered a blessing for several reasons. It is a well-known fact that people who live longer have more experiences, have more opportunities to learn from their successes and failures, and have more time to create deeper relationships with others. In this essay, I will discuss the benefits of longevity and why it is considered a blessing.\n\nFirstly, the elderly who have lived for a long time can offer valuable insights into life as they have had many experiences. They can share wisdom gained from their experiences with those who are younger than them, which can lead to better decision making. This can be particularly helpful in various aspects of life such as careers, relationships, and personal growth. For example, my grandmother, who has lived for more than 90 years, has shared many stories from her life which have taught me about perseverance, hard work and staying optimistic in the face of adversity.\n\nSecondly, longevity allows us to form stronger and long-lasting relationships with our loved ones. The longer we live, the more time we have to maintain our relationships and create deeper connections with the people we care about. For instance, my great-grandparents celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary before they passed away, and they were able to enjoy many years together. They had a bond that only grew stronger as they aged, proving that longevity has a significant impact on relationships.\n\nIn addition to the benefits experienced by individuals, longevity also has benefits on society more broadly. With increasing life expectancy, people are staying productive for longer. They are able to contribute to their communities and to society as a whole. For example, many older individuals continue to work or volunteer, which adds value to society and provides a sense of purpose and accomplishment.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that longevity is a blessing only if one is able to enjoy good health throughout their life. Longevity can become a burden for those who suffer from chronic illnesses or who need long-term care. Therefore, maintaining good health habits can help ensure that longevity remains a blessing for as long as possible.\n\nIn conclusion, longevity is certainly a blessing as it allows individuals to gain valuable experiences, form deeper relationships and contribute to society over an extended period of time. It is important to appreciate the gift of longevity as it can provide a fulfilling and meaningful life, but it is also important to take good care of oneself to maintain good health and continue to benefit from this blessing."

                "prompt": "Should marriage be a life-long commitment?",
                "response": "Marriage is a union that binds two people together in a sacred and emotional relationship. It is considered a commitment to one's partner. With the rising cases of divorce, the question arises if marriage should be a life-long commitment. In my opinion, marriage should be a life-long commitment, and in this essay, I will elaborate on my stance with relevant examples.\n\nFirstly, marriage is not just a contract but a promise of partnership and companionship. A life-long commitment to marriage helps the partners understand the essence of the relationship and strive towards making it work. For instance, my grandparents have been married for over 60 years, and they have faced numerous challenges. There have been times when both of them have disagreed, but they worked towards resolving their conflicts. Their commitment to each other was unwavering, and it has strengthened their relationship.\n\nSecondly, marriage requires effort and investment to make it work. If marriage is not a life-long commitment, partners may not feel the need to invest in the relationship, leading to a lack of effort from both sides. As a result, the marriage falls apart eventually. For example, a recent study shows that couples who enter into marriage with the intention of not making a life-long commitment have a higher risk of getting divorced. The study also highlights that couples who get married with the intention of making a life-long commitment tend to put in more effort into the relationship, leading to a happier and fulfilled marriage.\n\nThirdly, marriage is an institution that serves diverse purposes such as companionship, emotional support, procreation, among others. Withholding from a life-long commitment robs the institution of its fundamental purpose. For instance, marriage provides a stable environment for raising children. A life-long commitment in marriage helps parents raise their children in a stable environment that provides emotional and financial security.\n\nIn conclusion, marriage should be a life-long commitment. It requires effort and investment from both partners, and a promise to create a fulfilling and lasting relationship. As a society, we need to acknowledge the significance of marriage and the importance of keeping it as a life-long commitment."

While some may argue that women have never had it so good, I believe this statement is only partially true. In this essay, I will explore both the progress made and the challenges that still remain.\n\nPoint: Women in the developed world have gained significant legal rights and economic opportunities.\n\nElaboration: Western countries have made great strides in granting women legal rights and protections. Women can now vote and run for political office, and laws against gender discrimination have been established in the workforce. Women have also achieved greater economic independence, with more opportunities for education and high-paying jobs.\n\nExample: Today, women in countries such as Canada, the United States, and the United Kingdom have surpassed men in obtaining college degrees. In the United States, women now represent 47% of the labor force. Women such as Kamala Harris and Jacinda Ardern have risen to prominent positions in politics.\n\nLink: This progress is undoubtedly a significant improvement over women's historical marginalization.\n\nPoint: Women in the developed world still face significant cultural and societal challenges.\n\nElaboration: Despite the progress made, women face a range of cultural and societal challenges. Women continue to be disproportionately represented in lower-paying jobs and in domestic work. Women also experience discrimination, harassment, and violence at work and in their personal lives.\n\nExample: In 2020, the World Economic Forum\u00a0reported that the pay gap between men and women in the United States narrowed by one cent, from 85 cents on the dollar to 86 cents. The same report showed that women are still underrepresented in leadership positions. Women are also frequently subjected to sexual harassment and domestic violence.\n\nLink: These continued issues demonstrate that women's position in society is not yet equal to that of men.\n\nPoint: Women in the developing world still face more significant challenges in obtaining rights and freedoms.\n\nElaboration: Women in many developing countries still suffer significant disadvantages in terms of access to healthcare, education, and economic resources. These women are often subjected to societal expectations of domestic care and are limited in their ability to own property or participate in political and economic life.\n\nExample: In Afghanistan, women are not allowed to leave their homes without a male guardian, and their ability to attend school, obtain employment, or participate in political life is severely restricted.\n\nLink: The challenges faced by women in the developing world should not be ignored in discussions of progress towards gender equality.\n\nIn conclusion, while significant progress has been made in granting women legal rights and economic opportunities in the developed world, women still face significant cultural and societal challenges. Furthermore, women in the developing world continue to suffer from a lack of access to healthcare, education, and economic resources. The fight for gender equality is far from over, and it is important to recognize both the progress made and the work still to be done."

                "response": "Abortion is a controversial topic that raises a number of moral issues. Proponents of abortion argue that women have the right to control their bodies and make choices about their reproductive health. Meanwhile, opponents of abortion argue that it is morally wrong to terminate a pregnancy and that it is equivalent to murder. In this essay, I will explore the various moral issues raised by abortion.\n\nFirstly, there is the issue of the morality of ending a potential life. Those against abortion argue that life begins at conception, and therefore, terminating a pregnancy is equivalent to killing a life. This moral standpoint is based on religious beliefs that emphasize the sanctity of life. Furthermore, modern science has shown that the fetus can feel pain as early as 20 weeks gestation, which adds weight to the argument that abortion is morally wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, supporters of abortion argue that the woman's right to control her own body trumps any potential moral claims of the fetus. This notion is based on the idea that women have the autonomy to make choices about their own lives, including the decision of whether or not to have a child. Proponents of abortion argue that it is unethical to force a woman to continue with a pregnancy if she does not want to do so.\n\nSecondly, there is the issue of the morality of using abortion as a form of birth control. Those against abortion argue that it is morally wrong for women to use abortion as a means of avoiding responsibility for their actions. They contend that an unwanted pregnancy should be prevented with contraception rather than terminated through abortion.\n\nIn contrast, supporters of abortion argue that contraception may not always be practical or available. Moreover, they suggest that women may face social, economic, or medical reasons as barriers to having a child. Therefore, they justify abortion as a necessary option to allow women to manage their lives and their own bodies.\n\nIn conclusion, abortion is a controversial issue with a range of moral implications. The debate over its morality is complex and still ongoing. Although there are opposing views on the morality of abortion, it is essential to respect the autonomy of the woman and allow her to make choices that are in line with her values, beliefs, and personal circumstances."

We are all responsible for our own health, and the actions we take can have a significant impact on our well-being. In this essay, I will explore how far we are responsible for our own health.\n\nPoint 1: Lifestyle Choices\nOur lifestyle choices are one of the most significant factors that contribute to our health. A sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits, and smoking are some of the leading causes of chronic diseases such as diabetes, heart diseases, and cancer. Therefore, we are wholly responsible for our health outcomes when we make these lifestyle choices.\n\nElaboration: \nFor instance, if we choose to indulge in unhealthy eating habits, such as consuming excessive amounts of sugary and fatty foods, we expose ourselves to the risk of obesity, diabetes, and other chronic diseases. This choice can result in a poor quality of life, and we will ultimately have to bear the consequences.\n\nExample: \nAccording to a Harvard School of Public Health study, an unhealthy diet is responsible for about 678,000 deaths annually in the United States. This statistic reinforces the fact that we have the power to choose what we consume, and it is our responsibility to make healthier choices.\n\nLink: \nTherefore, we have a significant responsibility for our own health outcomes when we make lifestyle choices.\n\nPoint 2: Physical Exercise \nPhysical activity has been proven to have significant benefits for our health. Exercise enables us to maintain healthy body weight, protects us against chronic diseases, and improves our overall well-being. Thus, we are responsible for incorporating physical activity into our daily routine.\n\nElaboration: \nRegular exercise can help reduce stress, improve our mood, and ensure that our bodies are functioning at optimal levels. This means that we will have greater energy and endurance, which will allow us to be more productive and lead healthier lives.\n\nExample: \nIndividuals who make regular exercise a part of their workday have been shown to be less stressed, more productive, and generally healthier than those who lead a sedentary lifestyle.[1] This example highlights the immense benefits of regular exercise on our health outcomes.\n\nLink: \nThe benefits of physical exercise are incontrovertible, and it is our responsibility to incorporate exercise into our daily routine to enjoy these benefits.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, we are entirely responsible for our health outcomes. Our lifestyle choices, physical activity, and the decisions we make all have a significant impact on our health. We must take a proactive approach towards promoting our health by making informed choices and engaging in activities that improve our overall well-being. Ultimately, our decisions will determine the quality of life we lead and the extent to which we enjoy good health."

Governments exist to achieve some primary aims that can vary depending on the ideology and understanding of the government's primary objective. In my opinion, the aims of the government are to ensure social welfare, promote economic growth, establish law and order, and preserve national security. \n\nFirstly, the government's aim should be to ensure social welfare by addressing the needs and problems of its citizens. The government should ensure that people are provided with basic necessities such as food, shelter, and healthcare. The government should provide support for groups of people who might need assistance, such as the elderly, poor, disabled, and unemployed. For instance, the Singapore government has implemented various schemes such as the Workfare Income Supplement scheme, Baby Bonus, and MediShield Life to provide financial and healthcare assistance to its citizens.\n\nSecondly, the government should promote economic growth by creating an environment that is conducive to businesses and facilitates job creation. This involves enabling entrepreneurship by providing funding and support for small businesses while ensuring that taxes and regulations are not restrictive. By promoting economic growth, the government can ensure that its citizens have access to better-paying jobs, and overall prosperity increases. For instance, countries like Japan and South Korea have embraced policies like free market economy and developed infrastructure to become some of the world's most prominent economic success stories.\n\nThirdly, the government should establish law and order to ensure citizens feel safe and secure. Governments ought to implement laws, regulations, and policies that deter crime, ensure justice is served, and maintain social order. This includes the police and the justice system to effectively protect the citizens and bring criminals to justice. Singapore, for instance, is known for its tough stance against crime and is renowned for its strict laws and regulations.\n\nLastly, the government should preserve national security by ensuring its citizens are safe from external threats. By investing in national security, the government can protect its citizens from security threats such as terrorism, crime, and war. The government should work in collaboration with other countries and international organizations to protect itself from external threats. For example, Singapore has excellent diplomatic relations with countries in the Asia-Pacific region and maintains a well-trained national defense force.\n\nIn conclusion, the government's aims should be to ensure social welfare, promulgate economic growth, establish law and order, and preserve national security. The government should work towards providing an environment that is conducive to businesses and individuals while ensuring its policies are in line with the principles of justice and adhere to societal norms."

                "prompt": "Why do countries place so much emphasis on sport?",
                "response": "Sports have always been an integral part of human culture, and countries across the world have been placing enormous emphasis on sports for a variety of reasons. This essay will discuss why countries emphasize sport so much and why it is essential for their development and growth.\n\nFirstly, sports bring a sense of national pride and unity to a country. When a country's athletes compete at the international level, it brings a nation together, and the citizens become proud of their athletes and country. For example, during the Olympics, countries come together to showcase their best athletes and celebrate their victories. Winning a medal in a global event generates a feeling of nationalistic pride among citizens, boosting their morale and unity.\n\nSecondly, sports provide economic benefits to countries by generating revenue. The Olympics, the World Cup, and other sports events attract a vast number of tourists, which helps boost the economy of the hosting nation. Besides, sports generate employment as people get employed in different jobs associated with sports, such as coaching, sports medicine, and sports equipment manufacturing.\n\nThirdly, sports help in personal growth and character development, which is essential for a country's future. Participation in sports generate qualities like discipline, teamwork, and perseverance, which help young people develop strong personalities that can serve them well in life. An individual's success in sports can also serve as a source of inspiration and motivation for others.\n\nLastly, sports help in improving physical fitness and mental health, which is vital for a country's well-being. Participating in sports provides youth with an alternative to engage in physical activity rather than indulging in unhealthy activities. This can decrease the chance of obesity and other physical-related illnesses. Additionally, sports have been proven to help improve mental health, as it helps reduce stress levels, anxiety, and depression.\n\nIn conclusion, countries place so much emphasis on sports because it brings a sense of national unity, generates economic benefits, promotes personal growth, and improves health. It is crucial for nations to develop their sports culture as it plays an essential role in overall national development and well-being."

                "prompt": "What common features do major world cities do you expect to have?",
                "response": "Major world cities are known for their unique characteristics and are often considered to be the epicenters of cultural, economic and political activity. While each city has its own distinctive features, there are some common similarities that one would expect to find in major world cities. In this essay, I will discuss some of the common features that one can expect to find in major world cities.\n\nThe first common feature of major world cities is their extensive transportation infrastructure. These cities typically have well-developed public transportation systems that connect residents to various parts of the city. For example, in Singapore, one can easily travel all across the island on the well-connected MRT (Mass Rapid Transit) system. Furthermore, most major world cities have large and busy international airports that serve as gateways to the world. For instance, London Heathrow airport serves millions of passengers every year, connecting them to destinations across the globe.\n\nAnother common feature of major world cities is their vibrant nightlife. These cities' nightlife experiences are always bustling with energy as people visit nightclubs, bars, and restaurants. For example, New York City is known as the \"city that never sleeps\" due to the extensive nightlife it offers. Similarly, Paris offers some of the world\u2019s best restaurants and bars that are frequented by locals and tourists alike.\n\nMajor world cities also have large, cosmopolitan populations that bring together people from different cultures and backgrounds. This diversity means that residents of these cities are exposed to different beliefs, languages, and customs, leading to a melting pot of cultures. For example, Toronto\u2019s population is highly diverse, with people from different origins and ethnicities living together in harmony.\n\nLastly, major world cities are frequently associated with iconic landmarks and attractions. For example, in Sydney, the Opera House is a world-renowned symbol of the city that attracts millions of visitors every year. Similarly, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and the Empire State Building in New York City are instantly recognizable landmarks that hold a special place in the hearts of many.\n\nIn conclusion, major world cities have several features that set them apart from other places around the globe. These cities' common features include well-developed transportation systems, vibrant nightlife experiences, highly diverse populations, and iconic landmarks, among others. Their unique features make them special and attract millions of visitors every year, cementing their status as centers of economic, cultural, and political activity."

                "prompt": "How important is the family in the nurturing of youth?",
                "response": "Family is the foundation of any society. It is the first and the most important institution that a person is exposed to since birth. It is where the nurturing of youth begins, and through its values and experiences, it shapes the future of the youth. The importance of family in the nurturing of youth cannot be overstated.\n\nFirstly, the family plays a critical role in the emotional and social development of the youth. A positive family environment with love, care, and support provides the youth with a sense of belonging, stability, and safety. This sense of security gives them the confidence and ability to express themselves, try new things, and take calculated risks in life. These situations help the youth develop their social and emotional skills, such as empathy, communication, and problem-solving.\n\nSecondly, family is crucial in imparting moral values and ethical standards to the youth. The family members act as role models and teach them the right values and beliefs, which eventually shape their worldview. Family is also instrumental in the development of character and personality of a person. For instance, instilling discipline, responsibility, and respect enables the youth to become well-rounded, responsible, and mature individuals that contribute positively to society.\n\nFurthermore, the family helps in the intellectual development of the youth. The family members can facilitate the learning process of the youth through reinforcement of skills and knowledge learnt in school or other social institutions. Aside from the formal education system, informal learning that occurs naturally in family settings, like shared meals, stories, and traditions, contribute significantly to the development of such critical skills as knowledge, communication, and problem-solving.\n\nLastly, the family has an essential role in preparing the youth for their future roles and responsibilities in life. The youth learn essential life skills, gradually becoming self-sufficient and autonomous adults. This learning is demonstrated through the understanding of the importance of education to secure a career path and financial security.\n\nIn conclusion, the family is an essential institution in the nurturing of youth. It has an undeniable influence on the emotional, social, moral, intellectual, and practical development of the youth. It is the family\u2019s responsibility to provide a nurturing environment where the youth can realize their full potential, and it is society's responsibility to promote and support families in this role. Through this collaboration, as a society, we develop well-rounded, knowledgeable, and responsible individuals who contribute positively to society."

                "prompt": "\u201cTradition hinders progress.\u201d Do you agree?",
                "response": "Tradition has been an essential part of human societies since time immemorial. It refers to the customs and practices that have been passed down through generations, shaping the way people live and interact with one another. While tradition has its merits, it has also been criticised for hindering progress. In this essay, I will argue that tradition does indeed have some negative impacts, but it is not solely responsible for hindering progress.\n\nTo begin with, tradition can sometimes impede progress by perpetuating outdated beliefs and practices. For example, traditional gender roles have long been used to justify sexism and discrimination against women, stifling their advancement in social, economic, and political domains. When these traditions are ingrained in society, it is difficult to imagine new social norms, and change feels uncomfortable. Therefore, tradition can be a hindrance to progress when implementing new ideas and ideologies.\n\nMoreover, tradition might also discourage innovation and creativity by promoting conformity, which stifles individual initiative and impedes progress. For instance, traditional schooling systems that emphasize rote learning over critical thinking can discourage students from venturing beyond established norms. In such cases, innovative solutions to societal and personal problems are discouraged, and progress is arrested.\n\nWhile tradition does have negative impacts, it is not always a hindrance to progress. Tradition can help preserve the unique cultures and customs of communities and promote social cohesion. Tradition can also teach people important values and ethics, such as honesty, respect, and hard work. These values can guide individuals towards a successful life and contribute to societal progress. For instance, in Singapore, cultural traditions such as respect for elders and the importance of hard work are instilled in children from an early age, contributing to the country's remarkable economic success.\n\nIn conclusion, I partially agree that tradition hinders progress. While traditions can perpetuate outdated beliefs, stifle innovation, and curb individuality, they can also preserve unique cultures, promote values, and contribute to societal progress. Progress is desired, but not at the expense of the cultural and historical heritage of a society. Therefore, we must strive to maintain a balance between tradition and progress."

                "prompt": "How should the criminal be treated?",
                "response": "The treatment of criminals is a complex issue that requires careful consideration. The way in which we treat those who break the law can have a profound impact on both the individual and society as a whole. In my opinion, criminals should be treated with a focus on rehabilitation instead of punishment.\n\nFirstly, rehabilitation is a more effective approach than punishment. Incarceration or physical punishment alone does not address the root causes of criminal behaviour. By providing educational and vocational training, counselling, and access to mental health support, we can give offenders the tools they need to reintegrate into society as productive members.\n\nFor example, a study conducted in Norway showed that their rehabilitation-focused prison system resulted in a significantly lower rate of recidivism compared to harsher prison systems in other countries. Instead of locking offenders up and throwing away the key, Norway\u2019s prisons provide inmates with access to education and job training, allowing them to develop skills and find employment upon release.\n\nFurthermore, treating criminals with rehabilitation rather than punishment helps to reduce the social and economic costs of crime. When offenders are released back into society without support or resources, they are more likely to continue offending and end up back in prison. This cycle of crime and punishment is not only costly to taxpayers but also perpetuates a sense of hopelessness and despair among those who have been incarcerated.\n\nLastly, by treating criminals with rehabilitation we can help to shift the focus from punishment to prevention. By addressing the underlying factors that contribute to criminal behaviour, such as poverty, lack of education, and mental health issues, we can help to prevent crime from occurring in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be tempting to punish criminals for their transgressions, a rehabilitation-focused approach is a more effective and humane way to address the issue of crime. By providing offenders with education, training, and support, we can help them to create better lives for themselves and contribute positively to society."

                "prompt": "Why do people want to have children?",
                "response": "People have diverse reasons for wanting to have children. Some do it because they feel it is a natural progression in their lives, while others do it because they want to pass on their genetic legacy. However, for most, having children is an enriching and fulfilling experience that allows them to experience the joys and challenges of parenthood.\n\nFirstly, for many, having children is an expression of love and commitment to their partners. Couples who decide to have children often do so because they are ready to take the next step in their relationship, and they wish to share their love and happiness with a little one. Moreover, children often strengthen the bond between couples, as they work together to raise and nurture their child.\n\nNext, many people have children because they want to experience the joys of parenthood. Raising a child can be a rewarding and fulfilling experience that brings a sense of purpose and meaning to one's life. Watching your child grow and develop, learn new skills, and discover new things is an incredibly rewarding experience that brings immense joy and satisfaction.\n\nFurthermore, having children can provide a sense of continuity and a connection to the future. By having children, individuals can pass on their values, traditions, and beliefs to future generations. In this way, having children can provide a sense of purpose and a feeling of legacy, as parents work to ensure that their children grow up to be happy and successful individuals.\n\nHowever, having children can also bring challenges and sacrifices. Raising children is a time-consuming and demanding task that requires significant amounts of patience, effort and resources. From dealing with temper tantrums and sleepless nights to planning for college tuition fees, raising children requires a lot of sacrifices and compromises.\n\nIn conclusion, there are many different reasons why people choose to have children. Whether it is for love, the desire to experience parenthood or to pass on their legacy, each reason is unique and valid. While raising children can be challenging, the joys and rewards of parenthood make it all worthwhile."

                "prompt": "Today the plight of children reveals the ugly side of man. Discuss.",
                "response": "The issue of children suffering is not new, and it continues to be a heartbreaking reality in many parts of the world. Despite the progress made in various aspects, the wellbeing of children is still compromised in different ways. Unfortunately, this plight of children also highlights the darker side of human nature.\n\nFirstly, the lack of basic needs and opportunities for children reflects the selfishness of people who hold power and resources. Instead of using their wealth and influence to secure a better future for the next generation, they tend to prioritize their own interests. For instance, some governments overlook the welfare of impoverished children, who lack access to sufficient food, healthcare, and education. Similarly, the exploitation of children for labor, prostitution, and trafficking in some economies leads to significant physical and emotional trauma.\n\nMoreover, the rise in domestic violence and other forms of abuse towards children is a manifestation of human cruelty. Children often fall victim to physical, emotional, and sexual abuse at their homes, schools, and communities. The fact that some people derive pleasure from hurting innocent children is a testament to the darker side of human nature. This behavior is particularly disturbing as children are often unable to defend themselves and seek help.\n\nLastly, the issue of child soldiers is another example of the ugly side of man's nature. The recruitment of children, often against their will, for military purposes, goes against basic human rights and is a blatant disregard for the vulnerability of children. This cruel practice exposes children to psychological manipulation and violence, depriving them of their childhood and future prospects.\n\nIn conclusion, the plight of children casts a spotlight on the darker side of human nature. The compromise of children's basic needs and rights, abuse, and manipulation of children for personal gain exposes the selfishness and cruelty of some members of society. It is essential to address these issues and work collaboratively to ensure that children's welfare is not compromised in any way. After all, children represent the most vulnerable and innocent members of society who deserve the utmost protection and care."

                "prompt": "The family unit is less important today. Comment.",
                "response": "The family unit has long been regarded as the nucleus of a stable society. However, in today's fast-paced world, the importance of the family unit is being constantly challenged. While the traditional model of the nuclear family may still hold sway in certain communities, it appears that the family unit is gradually losing its relevance. In this essay, I will examine the reasons behind this trend and evaluate its implications for society.\n\nFirstly, the rise of individualism in modern society has led to a decline in the importance of family ties. With people placing greater importance on their own personal goals and pursuits, the idea of prioritizing the needs of the family unit has become less popular. This shift in attitudes can be seen in the decreasing number of people who choose to get married and have children, preferring instead to focus on their careers and personal interests.\n\nSecondly, the increasing prevalence of technology has also contributed to the weakening of family bonds. With social media and the internet allowing people to easily connect with others from different parts of the world, the need for close familial relationships may be deemed less necessary. Furthermore, the internet provides easy access to a wealth of information and entertainment, which can serve as substitutes for traditional family bonding activities.\n\nFinally, the changing nature of work has impacted the family unit as well. With globalisation and the need for businesses to operate across different time zones, many workers have to work long and irregular hours, often leaving them with little time to spend with their families. This has disrupted the traditional roles of parents and caregivers, and has led to a decrease in quality family time.\n\nHowever, the decline of the family unit is not without its drawbacks. The breakdown of the family unit can lead to social problems such as an increase in crime rates, teenage pregnancies and substance abuse. Furthermore, the loss of familial support can have a negative impact on individuals' mental health and wellbeing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the family unit may no longer hold the same level of importance in our society as it once did, it still plays a crucial role in fostering social stability and individual wellbeing. While the reasons behind its decline may be varied, we must remain cognizant of the fact that the family unit remains an essential part of a healthy and stable society."

                "prompt": "\"The only means to censorship is self-regulation.\u201d Do you agree?",
                "response": "Censorship is a topic that has been debated for centuries. In today's society, there are many different opinions on how censorship should be implemented. Some believe that self-regulation is the only means to censorship, while others believe that censorship should be enforced by an external body. In this essay, I will argue that while self-regulation is a crucial component of censorship, it is not the only means to effectively regulate content.\n\nFirstly, I believe that self-regulation is important because it allows individuals to take responsibility for their own actions. When we regulate ourselves, we make conscious decisions about what we choose to say or do. This means that we are more likely to think about the potential consequences of our actions. For example, if a writer self-regulates their work, they may choose to avoid controversial topics or language that may offend certain readers. In this way, self-regulation can be an effective way of promoting responsible behavior.\n\nHowever, while self-regulation is important, it alone is not enough to effectively regulate content. There are times when external regulation is necessary to ensure that certain standards are met. For example, if a film contains violent or explicit scenes, it may be necessary for an external body to regulate it to ensure that it is appropriate for audiences of a certain age. In this way, external regulation is an essential component of censorship, as it ensures that standards are met and that content is appropriate for certain audiences.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to recognize that self-regulation alone may not be sufficient in cases where individuals face pressures or incentives to publish harmful or misleading content. In such cases, an external regulatory body becomes necessary to ensure that harmful or misleading content cannot be published. For example, if a company has a financial incentive to promote a product, they may be tempted to publish misleading information about the product. In such cases, an external regulatory body would be necessary to ensure that the public is not misled.\n\nIn conclusion, while self-regulation is an important aspect of censorship, it alone is not enough to effectively regulate content. External regulation is necessary to ensure that certain standards are met and that harmful or misleading content is not published. Therefore, a combination of self-regulation and external regulation is the most effective means of censorship."

                "response": "The events of the past few years have led many to speculate that a Third World War is becoming increasingly likely. The following essay will explore some of these developments, and consider their potential impact on global stability.\n\nFirstly, the rise of nationalism and populism in many countries has led to increased tensions between nations. This is particularly evident in Europe, where the UK's decision to leave the EU has caused a great deal of uncertainty and mistrust. Many other nationalist movements have gained ground in recent years, and this has led some to fear that the fragile peace that has existed in Europe since the end of the Second World War may be under threat.\n\nSecondly, the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Ukraine have created a dangerous situation in which several major world powers are involved in direct or proxy wars. Russia and the US, in particular, have taken opposing sides in both of these conflicts, and this has led to a sharp deterioration in relations between the two nations. Any misstep by either side could lead to a direct military confrontation, with potentially catastrophic consequences.\n\nThirdly, the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology has made the prospect of a nuclear war all the more frightening. North Korea's increasingly aggressive stance towards the US and its allies, coupled with its successful tests of long-range missiles, has made it a particular cause for concern. Any miscalculation on either side could lead to a devastating nuclear strike that would have far-reaching consequences for the entire world.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is impossible to predict whether a Third World War will actually take place, there are certainly several developments that have made it more likely. If countries do not work together to reduce tensions and defuse conflicts, the consequences could be catastrophic. It is vital that world leaders take steps to promote dialogue and cooperation, and to avoid the dangerous brinkmanship that could lead to a global conflict."

                "response": "Regional cooperation has become increasingly important in today's highly interconnected world. In this essay, I will argue that there is a pressing need for regional cooperation in various aspects of society. \n\nFirstly, regional cooperation can bring about economic benefits to countries in a region. For instance, countries can engage in trade agreements to reduce tariffs and foster free trade, leading to lower costs for businesses and consumers alike. This can improve the competitiveness of businesses and ultimately encourage economic growth. An excellent example of this is the ASEAN Free Trade Area, which has been in effect since 1993 and has resulted in significant increases in intra-regional trade.\n\nSecondly, regional cooperation can help to address shared environmental issues. Climate change is a global issue that affects all countries, but we have seen that smaller regions have taken the lead in promoting sustainable initiatives. For example, the Caribbean Community Climate Change Centre coordinates efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change across the region. By working together, countries can address environmental challenges more effectively and reduce the impact of global warming.\n\nThirdly, regional cooperation can also address security challenges and promote peace. In Southeast Asia, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) has been instrumental in promoting regional stability and preventing conflicts. It has facilitated talks between member countries and other nations on a range of security issues such as territorial disputes, terrorism, and transnational crime. These efforts have helped to reduce tensions and maintain peace in the region.\n\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that regional cooperation is necessary in today's interconnected world. By working together, countries can reap economic benefits, address shared environmental issues, and promote security and peace. The ASEAN and its efforts towards strengthening regional cooperation demonstrate the effectiveness of such cooperation in fostering growth and mutual benefits."

                "response": "Art has been a fundamental part of human life for generations, and it is often celebrated for its capacity to evoke strong emotions and convey profound messages. However, some argue that art serves no practical purpose and, as Oscar Wilde famously proclaimed, \"All art is useless.\" In this essay, I will explore this statement and provide my opinion on whether all art is useless.\n\nFirstly, it is true that some forms of art seem to have no tangible benefit to society. For example, abstract paintings, experimental music, and avant-garde theatre do not always have an explicit meaning. Some people may argue that these artworks are merely exercises in self-expression or, at best, a form of entertainment for those who appreciate them.\n\nHowever, while such art forms may not have a direct impact on the material world, they still have value as cultural experiences. They can inspire people, encourage creativity, and promote critical thinking. In this sense, art is not entirely useless, even if it does not always have an obvious function.\n\nSecondly, if we consider the broader landscape of art, we begin to see how it can be very far from \"useless.\" For instance, art has the potential to spark social change. Art can create a platform for marginalized communities to speak out against oppression and engender empathy in those who may not otherwise be open to understanding their plight. For example, the Black Lives Matter movement in the United States has been greatly supported by artists who use their work to raise awareness and promote social justice. These artworks have served a crucial purpose in the ongoing fight against systemic racism and oppression.\n\nFinally, art also has economic and commercial importance, particularly in the entertainment industry. Films, music, and television programmes generate billions of dollars globally each year. Artistic creations also help to promote tourism and cultural exchange between nations, which can have positive economic benefits.\n\nIn conclusion, while Oscar Wilde's famous statement that \"All art is useless\" may appear provocative on the surface, it is not entirely accurate. Art has the potential to serve many meaningful purposes, even if some forms of art may seem, at first glance, to have little practical application. Art can spark transformational social movements, provide cultural experiences, and generate wealth. While the value of art may not always be immediately apparent, we must not underestimate the importance of creativity in our society."

                "prompt": "Examine whether \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d is an appropriate description of women today.",
                "response": "The phrase \"the weaker sex\" has been used for centuries to imply that women are physically, emotionally, and mentally weaker than men. However, in modern times, this description might not be appropriate due to various reasons.\n\nFirstly, women are now seen as equals in the workforce. Women are being employed as CEOs, managers, lawyers, doctors, and pilots. Many of these women are doing the same job as men, if not better, and receiving equal salaries. Therefore, it can be argued that women are not weaker than men in their ability to perform challenging tasks.\n\nMoreover, women have also been fighting against gender stereotypes for a long time, not just in the workforce but also in daily life. Women can be muscular and strong, just like men, and can participate in physical activities such as boxing, martial arts, and weightlifting. Women are also more independent, and many choose not to get married, and are comfortable living alone. Thus, they are no longer the emotional and dependent gender.\n\nIn addition, many women are prominent leaders in the world today. They are leading countries, organizations, and initiatives that are making significant changes in the world. Women like Angela Merkel, Jacinda Ardern, Kamala Harris, and Aung San Suu Kyi all occupy powerful positions that require great skill and strength. It is clear that women are no longer the weaker sex in these domains.\n\nFinally, while it is true that men are physically stronger than women, this does not make women inferior. Strength is not the only measure of one\u2019s worth. Women can be intellectual and creative, and many excel in artistic fields, such as music, writing and painting.\n\nIn conclusion, the phrase \u201cthe weaker sex\u201d could be considered inappropriate to describe women today. Women have proven that they are capable of achieving great things on equal terms as men and are breaking the traditional gender stereotypes through their works. Therefore, it is essential that we see women as equals rather than through the lens of outdated gender roles."

                "prompt": "\u201cEducation should be the first concern of any government.\u201d Do you agree?",
                "response": "Education should undoubtedly be the first concern of any government. Knowledge is a critical tool that shapes an individual\u2019s life and the way they perceive the world. Therefore, it is essential for governments to prioritize education so that their citizens can be well-informed and make informed decisions for the betterment of society.\n\nFirstly, education is instrumental in developing critical thinking and decision-making skills, which are essential for effective citizenship. This skill is vital in making choices that can either harm or benefit society. For example, if citizens are not well-informed about climate change, they may not be aware of their responsibility to reduce carbon emission, leading to worsening climate conditions. However, if equipped with relevant knowledge, people can make informed decisions towards environmental protection.\n\nFurthermore, education plays a pivotal role in shaping the economy of a country. A well-educated workforce is essential to ensure that a country can remain competitive in the global economy. Education opens up opportunities for industries to thrive, promotes innovation and encourages investment, leading to a more prosperous economy.\n\nLastly, education helps to create a more harmonious and cohesive society. Education leads to a better understanding of different cultures and values, which leads to greater social cohesion. This is especially important for multicultural societies like Singapore, where social harmony is critical for a peaceful coexistence.\n\nIn conclusion, education is undoubtedly the most critical investment for a government, and this investment must begin early. Providing quality education ensures that citizens can make informed decisions based on fact and not on false information. It is vital for governments to invest in education, not only for the benefit of the individual but also for the good of societies at large."

                "response": "Teachers are the cornerstone of any society. They lead the next generation by sharing their knowledge and experience. Their contribution to humanity is indispensable. In this essay, I will explore the various roles played by teachers in shaping the world.\n\nFirst and foremost, teachers are responsible for educating the youth. They provide an open platform for students to learn new things and expand their horizons. The teacher imparts new knowledge, skills, and values that inspire students to become better individuals. Additionally, teachers teach critical-thinking and problem-solving skills, encouraging students to find solutions to complex problems.\n\nTeachers also act as role models for students. They shape a student's worldview and teach them how to face the world with dignity. A good teacher portrays optimistic thinking and selflessly guides students in a positive and constructive manner. Such teachers are an inspiration to their students and are remembered fondly by them.\n\nA teacher's influence goes beyond the classroom. Teachers inspire their students to aspire for greatness. They recognize the unique talent of each student and nurture them in their respective fields. For instance, an outstanding teacher may inspire a student to become an astronomer, a scientist, or a humanitarian worker. Such inspirational teachers foster a sense of purpose in their students and contribute significantly to advancing human development.\n\nFinally, teachers help build communities. They create a classroom culture that fosters trust and respect. They encourage collaboration and mentorship. Through their actions, teachers promote a sense of community that extends beyond the classroom walls. Good teachers recognize the importance of social cohesion and empowers their students to be change agents in their communities.\n\nIn conclusion, teachers play an integral role in advancing the world. They educate, model behaviour, influence, and inspire students to push the boundaries of knowledge and to be their best selves. Their teaching not only benefits the individual, but society as a whole. Teachers dedicate their lives and contribute to making the world a better place. They are a source of pride, admiration, and respect."

                "prompt": "Consider the impact of advertising.",
                "response": "Advertising has become an integral component of modern-day marketing strategies. It is no longer a mere tool for brand promotion, but an essential part of any business campaign. Advertising plays a crucial role in shaping consumer behavior and influencing their perception of products and services. In this essay, I will explore the impact of advertising by examining its ability to sway our purchasing decisions, affect our attitudes and behavior towards products and services, and its impact on society as a whole.\n\nFirstly, advertising has an undeniable influence on our purchasing decisions. Advertisements appeal to our emotions and desires, creating a need or want for a product. Advertisers use tactics such as celebrity endorsements, catchy slogans, and vibrant imagery to evoke an emotional response from the viewer. This technique is demonstrated in the success of Apple's \"Think Different\" campaign, in which they associated their brand with individualism and creativity. As a result, consumers were more likely to purchase Apple products to align with these desirable traits.\n\nSecondly, advertising has the power to shape our attitudes and behavior towards products and services. Through frequent repetition and exposure, we may unconsciously develop a preference for certain brands or products. For example, McDonald's advertising has created an association between their food and positive emotions such as happiness and satisfaction. This has resulted in a generation of consumers who have formed a habit of consuming fast food regularly, increasing their susceptibility to health issues.\n\nFinally, advertising also has a significant impact on society as a whole. The portrayal of gender roles in advertisements has a direct impact on how individuals perceive themselves. Advertising often reinforces gender stereotypes, suggesting that women should conform to conventional beauty standards and men should be strong and assertive. This has a detrimental effect on society, particularly on youth, leading to unrealistic expectations and the development of low self-esteem.\n\nIn conclusion, advertising has a significant impact on our daily lives. It has the power to influence our purchasing decisions, shape our attitudes and behavior towards products and services, and impact society's values and beliefs. While advertising is an essential component of modern-day marketing, it is necessary to regulate its use to ensure that it aligns with ethical standards and benefits society as a whole."

                "response": "As an art enthusiast, I would choose to exhibit a collection of contemporary art pieces from emerging artists. This would provide a platform for upcoming talents to display their work and also raise awareness of their incredible artistic abilities. Moreover, showcasing contemporary art highlights the trends, styles and techniques being used in today's creative world.\n\nTo begin with, the first section of the exhibition would consist of paintings. This would not only include oil, watercolour and acrylic on canvas, but also mixed media art that incorporates textures and patterns. For instance, one artist could have used unconventional materials like coffee grounds, sand or fabric to add an interesting element of texture to their work.\n\nIn the second section, sculptures and installations would be on display. This would add more dimension and create depth for visitors to explore and envision the motive behind the artist\u2019s creations. The sculptures could range from abstract shapes to recognisable figures expressing various emotions. Similarly, the installation could vary from interactive exhibits to sculptures that incorporate natural elements.\n\nThe last section of the exhibition would showcase digital and media art inspiring visitors to appreciate the beauty of technology and its role in art today. From digital paintings to videos, this section would show different types of digital works with unique storytelling abilities, conveying deep messages through the use of technology.\n\nTo complement the exhibition, there could be an audio guide for visitors detailing the inspiration behind each piece and how the artist\u2019s story influenced their creation. Additionally, we could invite the artists for a meet-and-greet with visitors, giving them an opportunity to interact with and learn more about the artists and their work.\n\nIn conclusion, as an art curator, the exhibition of contemporary art would be my choice. It provides a platform for emerging artists to showcase their work and brings attention to how today\u2019s community balances between traditional art values and latest digital technologies. I hope this exhibition would inspire and bring joy to art lovers and those simply curious about contemporary art."

                "prompt": "What important factors would you consider when choosing a job for your career?",
                "response": "Choosing the right job can have a significant impact on one's career path. Several factors should be considered before choosing a job, including job satisfaction, career growth opportunities, company culture, work-life balance, and compensation packages.\n\nFirstly, job satisfaction is a critical factor when choosing a career. A job that provides a sense of fulfilment and purpose contributes significantly to one's well-being and motivation to work. For example, a medical professional who enjoys helping patients may find satisfaction in a role that involves patient care, making a tangible difference in the lives of others.\n\nSecondly, career growth opportunities play a vital role in career development. One should choose a job that offers opportunities for learning, growth, and career advancement. For instance, an individual with a passion for sales and marketing can look for an organization offering regular training, mentorship, and the chance to take on new responsibilities.\n\nThirdly, the company culture is another crucial factor when choosing a job. It is essential to work in a positive and supportive working environment since it greatly contributes to one's well-being and productivity. For example, a company that aligns with an individual's personal values and beliefs, and has a warm and welcoming culture, will be a better fit.\n\nFourthly, work-life balance is another factor to consider when choosing a job. Having a healthy balance between work and personal life is crucial to one's overall well-being. A job that offers flexibility in working hours or the option to work remotely can be an excellent choice.\n\nLastly, compensation packages are essential when choosing a job. It is important to consider aspects such as salary, benefits, bonuses, and other perks. For example, a job that offers an attractive bonus scheme or a comprehensive health plan may be more appealing to an individual.\n\nIn conclusion, job satisfaction, career growth opportunities, company culture, work-life balance, and compensation packages are vital factors to consider when choosing a job. A thorough consideration of these factors can help an individual make an informed decision and ultimately contribute to career success."

                "prompt": "Discuss the benefits of doing volunteer work.",
                "response": "Volunteering is an act of providing service to others without the expectation of receiving anything in return. It is a noble act that has numerous benefits for both the volunteer and the community they serve. In this essay, we will explore the benefits of doing volunteer work.\n\nFirstly, volunteering enables one to gain experience, skills and knowledge in various fields, as it offers a platform for individuals to develop their abilities through practical application. For example, a person who volunteers at a hospital will gain experience in patient care, learn about medical procedures and understand the workings of a healthcare facility. This knowledge can be useful for future educational or professional endeavors and can even open doors to job opportunities.\n\nSecondly, volunteering helps to build strong relationships, foster teamwork and develop a sense of community. When people work towards a common goal, it creates a bond that transcends individual differences and breeds a sense of unity based on shared values. Additionally, volunteering with friends and family can be a fun and rewarding experience, and it provides an opportunity to strengthen relationships by working together towards a cause.\n\nThirdly, volunteering has mental health benefits. Studies have shown that volunteering can increase self-esteem, reduce stress levels and promote happiness. Helping others can give people a sense of purpose, and it is a proven way to combat feelings of loneliness or isolation. When people feel like they are making a difference in someone else's life, it can give them a sense of fulfillment that contributes to their overall well-being.\n\nLastly, volunteering allows for personal growth and development. By stepping outside of their comfort zones and engaging with people from diverse backgrounds, volunteers can broaden their perspectives and gain a deeper understanding of the world around them. They can also develop new skills such as leadership, communication, and problem-solving, that can be beneficial in both personal and professional contexts.\n\nIn conclusion, volunteering is an activity with numerous benefits, including gaining experience and knowledge, building strong relationships, mental health benefits and personal growth. It provides a platform for people to give back to their communities and contribute to a greater cause. Therefore, individuals should consider volunteering as a way to not only benefit others but also to enrich their own lives."

                "prompt": "One man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter. Do you agree?",
                "response": "The oft-quoted statement \"one man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter\" highlights the fact that whether a person is seen as a terrorist or a freedom fighter depends on one\u2019s perspective. While some may argue that the end justifies the means and justify the actions of so-called freedom fighters, others argue that terrorism is never justifiable. In this essay, I will present arguments for both perspectives.\n\nIt is true that for many oppressed individuals and groups, violent resistance is seen as the only means available to effect change. In the narrative of their struggle, their acts of violence are justified as retaliation for years of exploitation, subjugation, and abuse. In this light, their actions amount to a just war. This is exemplified in the actions of figures such as Nelson Mandela in apartheid-era South Africa, who fought against the white authorities for the rights of black citizens. Mandela, revered as a hero today, was considered a terrorist by the very state whose laws he sought to reform.\n\nOn the other hand, it is equally true that terrorism is never justified. Regardless of how noble the cause may be, attacking innocent civilians is morally indefensible. The use of terror tactics to create fear among civilians, for example, is not an acceptable way to pursue a political agenda. Such actions are not only immoral but also ineffective in achieving political goals. By resorting to violence and terrorism, they are more likely to lose supporters and legitimacy, which can ultimately hurt their cause.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \u201cOne man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter\u201d is a paradox that is difficult to resolve. While violent resistance may be justified by the oppressed, the use of terror tactics must never be accepted or condoned. It is essential to view the issue from both perspectives and accept that often there is no easy answer to the debate. Ultimately, to achieve lasting peace and promote social justice, all struggles for freedom and human rights must be conducted through peaceful means and respect for human dignity."

                "prompt": "Is a world without racial conflicts an impossible dream?",
                "response": "Racial conflicts have been a pervasive issue faced by most of the countries across the world. Racial conflicts arise when one group or individual perceives another group or individual as a threat to their racial identity, social status and economic opportunities. While some argue that a world without racial conflicts is an impossible dream, others believe that it is achievable. \n\nFirstly, those who believe that a world without racial conflicts is an impossible dream argue that racial differences have been an integral part of human history, and therefore, it is inevitable to have conflicts. Moreover, racial conflicts have been perceived as a natural response to the changing economic, political and social landscape. For instance, the rise of China as a global economic powerhouse has led to racial conflicts in many developed countries where the Chinese population is seen as a competition for jobs and resources. \n\nHowever, the counter-argument is that racial conflicts arise not because of differences, but because of the lack of understanding and acceptance of those differences. In fact, embracing diversity can lead to better cultural exchange, tolerance and mutual respect. Furthermore, the world has witnessed numerous instances of individuals and communities coming together to celebrate diversity and unity. For instance, the United States' first black president, Barack Obama, was elected in 2008, signifying a new era of racial harmony in the country. \n\nMoreover, the role of education and awareness cannot be overlooked in the effort to eliminate racial conflicts. Educated societies are more likely to recognize the value of diversity and respect the differences that exist between them. Educational institutions play a significant role in promoting progressive social values and encouraging positive interactions between people of different races. \n\nIn conclusion, while some argue that a world without racial conflicts is an impossible dream, it is important to note that there are many examples of societies that have achieved this dream. The path towards a world without racial conflicts is through mutual respect, tolerance and understanding. By promoting such values through education, awareness and cultural exchange, it is possible to create a society where racial conflicts are deemed unacceptable."

                "prompt": "From your own experience, how would you define the pleasures of reading?",
                "response": "Reading is one of the most popular hobbies that has been found to have plenty of benefits, including the intellectual, emotional, and even social ones. As an avid reader myself, I find reading to be a worthy leisure activity that provides various pleasures.\n\nFirstly, reading is a source of immense pleasure that stems from the intellectual stimulation that takes place. For instance, when reading a book, one must comprehend complex ideas and concepts, which challenge the mind and help to improve brain function. Reading also allows one to broaden their vocabulary, develop language skills and enhance their comprehension abilities. Furthermore, the act of reading requires one to use their imagination to visualize the characters, settings, and the overall story. This provides a sense of escapism and leads to a feeling of immersion and absorption, which provides a pleasurable experience.\n\nSecondly, the pleasure of reading can also be attributed to its emotional benefits. Reading has the power to evoke strong emotions by enabling the reader to connect with the characters and their experiences. Often, a reader can identify with a character, their struggles, or even their triumphs, and as a result, create empathy and a deeper connection with the character. This connection, in turn, stimulates the senses and produces a pleasurable experience.\n\nLastly, reading for pleasure provides an excellent opportunity to develop a social bond. When discussing books with friends, communities and attending book clubs, this shared interest can often lead to a deeper intimacy, increased understanding within communities and, build new friendships. The social aspect of reading further enhances one's pleasure of reading.\n\nIn conclusion, my own experience with reading can be characterized by its intellectual stimulation, emotional connection, and social benefits. These contribute to the overall sense of pleasure, which can lead to a lifetime love for books."

                "response": "As an avid reader, I strongly believe that a good book is indeed a good friend. It can provide comfort, knowledge, and entertainment, just like a faithful companion. However, there are also some drawbacks to this comparison that we must consider.\n\nFirstly, a good book can be a source of comfort and support. It can make us laugh, cry, and feel a range of emotions that allows us to establish a deep connection with its characters. When we are feeling lonely or need an escape from reality, a good book can be just as helpful as spending time with a close friend.\n\nMoreover, reading a book can also provide us with knowledge and wisdom. It is a way to expand our horizons and learn about new worlds, cultures, and perspectives. A good book can teach us life lessons and inspire us to become better versions of ourselves.\n\nIn addition, books can be a form of entertainment, just like a good friend who knows how to make us laugh. Reading can be a relaxing and enjoyable activity that helps us to unwind after a long day.\n\nHowever, it is also important to acknowledge that books cannot replace human connection entirely. While a book may provide comfort and insight, it cannot offer the same level of emotional support and empathy that a real friend can provide.\n\nFurthermore, books can be limiting in terms of personal growth. While reading a book can provide a wealth of knowledge, it is still important to engage in real-life experiences that allow us to grow as individuals and interact with others on a personal level.\n\nIn conclusion, while books can provide comfort, knowledge, and entertainment, we must also acknowledge that they cannot replace human connection entirely. We should strive to have a balance between the two, as both offer unique benefits that are essential for personal growth and well-being. Therefore, a good book is a good friend, but it cannot and should not be a substitute for human companionship."

                "prompt": "Why read when you can watch a film?",
                "response": "In today's digital age, with the rise of streaming platforms like Netflix and YouTube, it is easy to dismiss reading as a form of entertainment and knowledge acquisition. However, reading can offer a unique and irreplaceable experience that a film cannot emulate. In this essay, I will discuss the advantages of reading over watching a film.\n\nFirstly, reading can stimulate the imagination. While films offer a visual representation of events, books rely on imagination to bring the story to life. This interactivity between the reader and the text allows for a more personal connection between the two, making the experience more enriching. For example, when reading Harry Potter series, one can imagine the magical creatures, the Hogwarts castle, and all the unique spells mentioned in the book. \n\nMoreover, reading provides an opportunity to develop critical thinking skills. Unlike films, books often delve deeper into characters\u2019 thoughts and emotions; readers can observe a protagonist\u2019s internal struggle and how they overcome their challenges. This process encourages readers to reflect upon their own experiences and ultimately develop their problem-solving skills. For instance, in 'To Kill a Mockingbird' by Harper Lee, readers can empathise with Scout Finch and contemplate the complexity of social issues like bigotry and injustice, which can help build their analytical abilities.\n\nAnother significant advantage of reading is that it can enhance language and vocabulary skills. Books expose readers to a wealth of words, phrases and expressions that could be invaluable for personal and academic growth. For example, reading Shakespeare can improve one's command of the English language, as his works are rich with diverse and complex language structures.\n\nLastly, reading is an inexpensive form of entertainment and does not require an internet connection as opposed to streaming platforms. It also offers an opportunity to disconnect from the distractions of the digital world and focus on deepening one\u2019s knowledge or gain a sense of fulfilment.\n\nIn conclusion, while films may offer entertainment and visual appeal, reading provides a more personal, imagination-stimulating, and enriching experience. It can also help in developing critical thinking, language, and vocabulary skills. Thus, it is imperative for individuals to recognise the merits of reading and to continue incorporating it into their daily lives."

                "response": "Keeping a diary has been a practice that has been in existence for thousands of years, and it continues to be a popular activity even in this tech-savvy era. It is a way to capture memories, express oneself, and organize personal thoughts. This essay will highlight the benefits of keeping a diary.\n\nFirstly, keeping a diary is an excellent way of relieving stress and anxiety. The act of writing down one's thoughts is therapeutic, especially during difficult times. Writing helps to declutter the mind, making it easier to prioritize thoughts and emotions. For instance, writing a diary before bedtime can help to release any anxieties and improve the quality of sleep.\n\nSecondly, keeping a diary helps to understand oneself better. Reflecting on past events helps one to see patterns in behavior and decipher how certain decisions and actions affect one's life. For example, by analyzing past entries, an individual can identify any obstacles that held them back and work towards overcoming them.\n\nThirdly, keeping a diary is also an excellent tool for personal growth and development. It is a platform where an individual can set goals, track progress, and hold oneself accountable. By reflecting on past goals and entries, an individual can assess their growth and identify areas that need improvement.\n\nFurthermore, keeping a diary is an excellent way to capture and preserve memories. It is not uncommon to forget certain details of a memorable event; however, by writing it down, they can be preserved and relived over and over again. This is particularly useful for people who like to document their lives or those who want to pass down their experiences to future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, keeping a diary has numerous benefits, including stress and anxiety management, self-awareness, personal growth, and preserving memories. It is an activity that requires little effort, yet it yields significant rewards. Therefore, individuals should incorporate diary writing into their daily lives to improve their overall well-being."

                "prompt": "Is modern technology beneficial or threatening to democracy?",
                "response": "In recent years, modern technology has made rapid advancements and has made a significant impact on various aspects of human life, including democracy. While some argue that technology has enhanced democracy, others claim that it poses a threat to it. This essay will discuss whether modern technology is beneficial or threatening to democracy.\n\nFirstly, modern technology has benefitted democracy by increasing citizen participation through social media. Citizens can now express their opinions and concerns to their leaders on social media platforms and engage in discussions about political issues. For example, during the Arab Spring uprisings in 2011, social media played a crucial role in mobilising citizens and organising protests against oppressive regimes.\n\nFurthermore, modern technology has improved transparency in democracy. Governments can now share information with their citizens through websites and social media platforms. Citizens can easily access information about their government's policies and decisions, which promotes accountability and prevents corruption. For instance, in 2016, leaked emails exposed corruption in the Democratic National Committee, which had a significant impact on the United States presidential election.\n\nHowever, modern technology also poses a threat to democracy, with the spread of fake news and misinformation. Social media platforms have become a breeding ground for spreading false information, often designed to manipulate public opinion. This phenomenon has resulted in political polarization, mistrust of mainstream media, and erosion of public credibility in democratic institutions. The Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018 is an example of how technology can influence the outcome of elections through the manipulation of public opinion.\n\nIn addition, modern technology has given rise to the phenomenon of \"echo chambers,\" where people's opinions are reinforced by their social media feeds, resulting in a loss of exposure to diverse viewpoints and the narrowing of minds. This can lead to the suppression of dissent and a lack of democratic debate.\n\nIn conclusion, modern technology has both benefits and threats to democracy. While it has improved transparency, increased citizen participation, and facilitated the spread of information, it has also contributed to the spread of false information, political polarization, and echo chambers. It is the responsibility of governments, citizens, and technology companies to work together to address these challenges and ensure that technology continues to enhance and not threaten democracy."

                "prompt": "Assess the view that attempts to control climate change can never be truly effective.",
                "response": "Climate change is a pressing issue that has been caused by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrialization. There have been attempts to control climate change, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing renewable energy sources. However, the effectiveness of these attempts has been questioned. This essay argues that while attempts to control climate change have limitations, they can still be effective if proper measures and strategies are adopted. \n\nFirstly, it is true that efforts to control climate change are limited in effectiveness. Climate change is a global issue that requires the cooperation of different countries to address. Unfortunately, some countries are unwilling to implement measures that would reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the United States, the world's second-largest emitter of carbon dioxide, withdrew from the Paris Agreement in 2017. Such actions reduce the chances of achieving the intended goals of the agreement, and subsequently, makes it difficult to control climate change. \n\nMoreover, there is a lack of political will to implement and enforce climate change policies effectively. Some policymakers prioritize economic growth, which often leads to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Also, some people are hesitant to make lifestyle changes to reduce carbon footprints, which increases environmental pollution. For example, the use of personal cars instead of public transport often leads to an increase in emissions that contribute to climate change. \n\nDespite these limitations, attempts to control climate change can still be effective if proper measures and strategies are adopted. Governments can use legislation and incentives to encourage the use of renewable energy sources. For example, Singapore has introduced a carbon tax to reduce emissions and promote the use of solar panels. Such policies can also influence the behaviour of citizens towards environmentally sustainable practices. \n\nFurthermore, technological advancements have also played a significant role in mitigating climate change. Innovations such as electric cars, energy-efficient appliances, and carbon capture technology are being developed and adopted globally. These technologies can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and facilitate the transition to a green economy. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are limitations to controlling climate change, it is possible to adopt effective measures and strategies to mitigate the problem. Governments need to implement and enforce policies that promote a green economy. Additionally, citizens must adopt sustainable practices in their daily lives to reduce carbon footprints. Technological advancements can also be used to reduce harmful emissions. With collective effort, it is possible to control climate change and prevent catastrophic environmental consequences."

                "prompt": "Individuals achieve sporting success, not nations. Discuss.",
                "response": "In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on national pride and glory in the world of sports. The Olympics, World Cup and other major sporting events are seen as opportunities for countries to showcase their best athletes and make a statement about their national identity. However, some argue that it is the individual athletes, not the countries they represent, who are responsible for achieving sporting success. In this essay, I will examine the various factors that contribute to individual sporting success and argue that it is ultimately the athlete who is responsible for their own achievements.\n\nFirstly, natural talent and ability play a significant role in determining an athlete\u2019s success. This can be seen in examples such as Usain Bolt, who is widely regarded as one of the greatest sprinters of all time due to his exceptional physical attributes. While Bolt undoubtedly trained hard to hone his skills, it is clear that his natural talent played a major role in his success. Similarly, in sports like tennis and golf, factors such as height, strength and hand-eye coordination can greatly impact an athlete\u2019s performance.\n\nFurthermore, an athlete\u2019s level of dedication and hard work is essential to achieving success in their chosen sport. This is exemplified in the case of Michael Phelps, who dominated the pool in the 2008 Beijing Olympics by winning eight gold medals. Phelps famously dedicated his life to swimming from a young age, training for over six hours a day for years on end. His commitment to his craft undoubtedly played a major role in his success.\n\nIn addition, the support of a strong coaching team can also greatly improve an athlete\u2019s chance of success. However, it is important to note that ultimately it is the athlete who has to put in the work and execute on the day. Take for example the famous tennis players Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal \u2013 both have had great coaches and teams backing them, but ultimately it is their own hard work, ability and determination that have made them successful.\n\nFinally, it is worth noting that individual athletes can often transcend national identity and achieve success on a global stage. Examples of this include iconic basketball stars Michael Jordan and LeBron James, both of whom became global sporting figures due to their incredible ability on the court and their status as cultural icons.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is certainly true that national identity can play a role in sporting success, ultimately it is the individual athlete who is responsible for their achievements. Natural talent, hard work, dedication and coaching support all play important roles, but it is the athlete themselves who must execute on the day and perform at their best. Therefore, it is individuals who achieve sporting success, not nations."

                "prompt": "'Countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out its own problems.' How far do you agree?",
                "response": "In the midst of conflicts in different parts of the world, there has been an ongoing debate over whether countries in turmoil should be allowed to tackle the situation by themselves. While some argue that external intervention may cause more harm than good, others believe that it is necessary for the international community to step in. In my view, while it is important to respect the sovereignty of nations, there are certain situations in which external intervention is necessary.\n\nOn the one hand, it could be argued that countries experiencing conflicts should be allowed to sort out their own problems without external intervention. Firstly, sovereignty of nations should be respected, and countries should have the right to handle their own internal affairs without interference from external powers. In addition, external intervention may lead to unintended consequences, such as the spread of violence beyond the borders of the country of the conflict. An example of this is the destabilization of Iraq following the US-led invasion in 2003 which led to the rise of extremist groups.\n\nOn the other hand, there are certain situations where external intervention is necessary. For instance, when a country is experiencing severe human rights abuses, the international community has a responsibility to act in order to protect civilians. This was the case in Libya during the Arab Spring, where the international intervention helped to protect civilians and eventually led to the overthrow of the oppressive regime. Additionally, the world has become more interconnected, and the spillover effect of conflicts in one country can spread to neighbouring countries. Therefore, in order to protect regional stability, external intervention may be required.\n\nMoreover, external intervention does not always have to be military intervention. Diplomatic intervention can be effective in facilitating negotiations and mediating between conflicting parties. This was the case in the peace talks that ended the decades-long conflict between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).\n\nIn conclusion, while respecting the sovereignty of nations is important, external intervention may be necessary in certain situations where the internal conflict affects the welfare of civilians and regional stability. Ultimately, the decision to intervene should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the context of the conflict and the possible consequences of intervention."

                "prompt": "Evaluate the claim that a country's well-being is dependent on its economic development.",
                "response": "A country's economic development has been widely regarded as a crucial component that contributes to its overall well-being. While some might argue that there are more factors that affect a country's prosperity, this essay will demonstrate that a strong economy remains an essential prerequisite for the overall well-being of a country.\n\nFirst and foremost, economic development directly translates to higher standards of living for the population. When a country's economy is thriving, more job opportunities are available for the people, leading to greater income and consequently a higher standard of living. This is evidenced by countries such as Singapore and South Korea, who have experienced remarkable economic growth over the past few decades, thereby raising their standards of living significantly.\n\nSecondly, a well-performing economy also leads to a greater capacity for the government to invest in public welfare measures such as healthcare, infrastructure, and education. Better healthcare facilities ensure better health outcomes for people, leading to a better quality of life. Apart from this, infrastructure such as roads and transportation facilities improve connectivity, thereby increasing economic activity and benefiting all sections of society.\n\nFurthermore, economic development also positively affects the overall security of the country. When a nation is economically stable, it is comparatively more insulated from external shocks and less likely to experience political upheavals due to financial instability. A stable economy also enables the government to spend more on defence and internal security measures, thereby ensuring the safety and security of its citizens.\n\nHowever, some might argue that economic development can lead to challenges such as income inequality and environmental degradation. While these issues are valid, they can be effectively addressed through policy measures such as progressive taxation and sustainable development practices.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic development is not the only factor that determines a country's overall well-being, it is undeniably critical in achieving it. A thriving economy implies a high standard of living for its population, investment in public welfare measures, and a secure environment. Therefore, it is crucial for governments to prioritise economic development while also taking measures to ensure that it is sustainable and equitable."

                "prompt": "'More than any other time, the old have no place in society today.' How far do you agree with this view?",
                "response": "The aging population is a rapidly growing concern, particularly in developed countries such as Singapore. With an increasing number of elderly individuals, there is a pressing need to address how they fit into society today. Some argue that the elderly have no place in society, but I am inclined to disagree with this view. While they may face challenges, the elderly still have a significant role to play in societal structures.\n\nFirstly, the elderly have a wealth of experience and wisdom that they can contribute to society. Having lived through a range of events and societal changes, they possess invaluable knowledge that younger generations can benefit from. For instance, grandparents can impart cultural traditions and family values to their grandchildren, thereby preserving heritage and identity. In this way, they play an essential role in maintaining societal continuity.\n\nMoreover, the elderly can participate in the workforce and play a role in the economy. With companies seeking more diversity in their workforce, older employees can bring in a lifetime of experience that younger workers may lack. A study done by Age Management Consultancy indicated that older workers tend to have a strong work ethic and can serve as ethical role models for younger employees. This implies that the elderly plays a crucial role in shaping the values and attitudes of the younger generation.\n\nFurthermore, older individuals can also make significant contributions to their communities. For example, they can volunteer their time at charitable organizations, mentor younger individuals, and participate in political movements. Their unique life experiences and perspectives can lead to innovative solutions for societal issues.\n\nHowever, it is undeniable that elderly individuals can face issues such as ageism and social isolation. Singaporean society tends to prioritize youth, and older individuals may find themselves marginalized or stigmatized. This can lead to feelings of loneliness and inadequacy. Therefore, there is a need for society to create more inclusive spaces in which the elderly can feel valued and heard.\n\nIn conclusion, I disagree that the elderly have no place in society today. While they may face challenges such as ageism, the elderly still have valuable contributions to make in various aspects of society. It is essential for us to recognize and appreciate the wealth of knowledge and abilities they possess, and create environments in which they can thrive."

                "prompt": "'The pursuit of equality between the sexes is not only futile but foolish.' Do you agree?",
                "response": "Throughout history, men and women have fought for equality between the sexes. However, some individuals argue that the pursuit of gender equality is both futile and foolish. In this essay, I will examine both sides of the argument and explain why I ultimately disagree that the pursuit of equality between the sexes is not only futile but foolish.\n\nFirstly, proponents of the view that gender equality is both futile and foolish argue that it is impossible to achieve perfect gender equality. According to them, there are inherent biological differences between men and women, such as differences in physical strength and reproductive organs, which makes it impossible for the sexes to be equal. They argue that, no matter how hard we try, women will always be at a disadvantage in certain areas like sports and military combat.\n\nWhile this argument may hold some weight, it fails to take into account the fact that gender equality is not just about physical differences between the sexes. Gender equality seeks to address the social, economic and political inequalities that women face, such as unequal pay, lower representation in leadership positions, and limited access to education and healthcare. These issues are not insurmountable and can be addressed through policies and legislation.\n\nFurthermore, proponents of the view that gender equality is both futile and foolish often dismiss the far-reaching benefits of gender equality. Studies have shown that societies that are more gender equal tend to have higher levels of human development, lower rates of violent crime and greater economic growth. Gender equality is not only a matter of justice, but it is also essential for the progress of society as a whole.\n\nAdditionally, gender equality is essential in building a fairer and more compassionate world. When women are empowered, it leads to greater peace, stability, and prosperity. Women are more likely to invest in their communities and less likely to engage in violent conflict. Therefore, the pursuit of gender equality is not only logical but also vital.\n\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of gender equality may be challenging, it is not a futile or foolish endeavor. Gender equality is a fundamental human right that is essential for the well-being of individuals and society as a whole. By continuing to work towards gender equality, we can move towards a fairer and more equitable world where everyone has the opportunity to reach their full potential."

                "prompt": "How important is a sense of history in shaping the future of Singapore\u2019s society?",
                "response": "A sense of history is crucial in shaping the future of Singapore's society. History provides an invaluable perspective on the past, enabling us to understand and appreciate the lessons learned from our ancestors. In many ways, Singapore's success is the result of its rich history, and its ability to learn from the past and apply those lessons to the future. In this essay, I will explore the importance of a sense of history in shaping the future of Singapore's society.\n\nFirstly, a sense of history provides us with a better understanding of the cultural and social forces that have shaped Singapore's society. By studying the history of Singapore, we can understand the origins of the country's unique blend of cultures, including Malay, Chinese, Indian, and Western influences. This knowledge enables us to appreciate and celebrate the diversity of our society, and to better understand the values and beliefs that underpin our social and cultural norms.\n\nFor example, Singapore's multicultural heritage is reflected in our public holidays, such as Chinese New Year, Hari Raya Puasa, Deepavali, and Christmas. These holidays are celebrated by people of all races and religions, reflecting Singapore's commitment to racial and religious harmony. By understanding the history and cultural significance of these festivals, we can appreciate and respect the traditions of different cultures and religions.\n\nSecondly, a sense of history serves as a reminder of the challenges that Singapore has faced in the past, and the resilience and determination that helped us overcome them. For example, the Japanese occupation of Singapore during World War II was a period of great hardship and suffering for our ancestors. However, the courage and spirit of resilience shown by Singaporeans during this period played a crucial role in shaping Singapore's future.\n\nSimilarly, the struggle for independence and the early years of nation-building were fraught with challenges and uncertainties. The determination and foresight of our founding leaders, such as Lee Kuan Yew, helped to lay the foundations for Singapore's success today. By studying these periods of history, we can learn from the experiences of those who came before us, and draw inspiration from their struggles and triumphs.\n\nIn conclusion, a sense of history is essential in shaping the future of Singapore's society. By studying the cultural and social forces that have shaped our society, we can better understand and appreciate our unique heritage. By learning from the challenges and persevering spirit shown by our ancestors, we can draw inspiration and confidence as we navigate the uncertainties of the future. Ultimately, our sense of history is a powerful tool that enables us to build a strong, cohesive, and resilient society for generations to come."

                "prompt": "Globalisation and greater interconnectedness worldwide means more conflict, rather than less. How far do you agree with this statement?",
                "response": "Globalisation and greater interconnectedness worldwide have undoubtedly led to a lot of positive changes. However, with the increase in trade, communication, technology and people moving across borders, some scholars argue that it has also led to a rise in conflict. In this essay, I will discuss how far I agree with the statement that globalisation has led to more conflict rather than less.\n\nTo begin with, it is important to recognise that globalisation has created new opportunities for contact and cooperation between nations. Pointedly, globalisation has facilitated greater economic interdependence, through the growth of free trade and foreign investment. For instance, the creation of the European Union and the formation of the ASEAN Economic Community have promoted economic growth, integration and cooperation within the region. Moreover, technological advancements have made communication more accessible, faster and efficient.\n\nHowever, despite the positive effects, globalisation has also created new sources of tension in international affairs leading to conflicts. Elaborating on this, the intensification of global connectivity has created both winners and losers. For instance, multinational corporations often have the power to exploit the natural resources of developing countries without giving back to the local community. This has led to a growing resentment against advanced economies. Furthermore, radical groups that seek to defend their national or cultural interests have used technology to promote their cause and recruit followers, resulting in conflicts both at the regional and global levels. The rise of cyber warfare, terrorism and the development of deadly weapons are just some examples of the growing threats we face globally.\n\nAnother example of how globalisation has led to more conflict is the issue of immigration. With the increase in the number of people migrating to other countries for economic opportunities or to escape conflict, there has been a growing fear of the \"other\" which has led to the rise of anti-immigrant and racist groups in many countries. Elaborating on this, ultra-nationalistic tendencies are becoming a growing trend in Europe leading to the refugee crisis and an unending conflict in the Middle East.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst globalisation has indeed led to greater interdependence and cooperation among nations, I believe that it has also led to more conflicts rather than less. The enormity of the challenges that countries face in the 21st century and the impact of globalisation requires a comprehensive solution that needs to balance the advantages of increased connectivity with a realistic recognition of the tensions and conflicts that may arise in the process. It is important that political leaders manage these complex issues by promoting the benefits of globalisation while also addressing some of the disadvantages through positive social policies that bring all sectors of the economy together."
