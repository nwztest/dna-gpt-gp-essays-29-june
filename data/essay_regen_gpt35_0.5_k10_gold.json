            "human_gen_truncate": ", the number of teachers flagged statewide in Dallas for having sex and other inappropriate relationships with students continues to rise, according to the Texas Education Agency (TEA). In 2018, the TEA opened 429 cases into inappropriate student-educator relationships, an alarming approximate 42% increase from the prior year. Thus, it can be argued that excessive competition encourages corrupt means to do well. Students will turn to wrong and immoral methods to stay on top of the competition. Additionally, placing high stakes in examinations not only results in excessive competition, it also leads to stress. Sometimes, the pressure may be too much to handle. In Singapore, we are no strangers to the huge amounts of academic stress that can overwhelm students. Singapore had a tragic wake-up call when an 11-year-old boy fell 17 floors from his bedroom window in a deliberate act of suicide. This was because he was fearful of revealing his poor grades to his parents. Moreover, more teenagers from top schools in Singapore are reportedly seeking help at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for school-related stress. This serves as a unfortunate example illustrating how a \"pressure-cooker\" education system with far too much competition can actually overly stress students out and ruin their psychological wellbeing or even cause them to take their precious lives.\nHowever, it must also be acknowledged that not all education systems in the world require competition to function well. For example, in Finland, high-stakes standardized tests are literally a completely foreign concept. These students take only a few tests yearly, and when they do, they are mostly low-stakes. However, the quality of teaching has made Finnish students consistently near the top when it comes to international education rankings including the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Therefore, while students are not pressurized to compete in high-stakes examinations like the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATs), they manage to perform very well because the Finnish education system focuses more on consistently learning and improving rather than one-shot measurements and ranking of student'scapabilities. This serves as proof that competition may not be necessary in the initial, pre-university stages as younger children may require more positive reinforcement to be motivated to keep learning.\nThere is more than one way to a destination. Competition can be a method to prevent complacency and laziness in students, and to serve as motivation for students to constantly better themselves. However, constant checks and reviews are definitely needed to ensure that competition does not breed corruption and underhand methods of succeeding. In addition, competition may not be necessary in every single aspect of learning as that may result in an overly stressful learning process. Instead, perhaps competition can come in at a later age, where students will be mature enough to cope with stress and the occasional defeat, which will make competition effective in shaping the character of students.

When competition becomes the sole focus of education, it can lead to increased stress and anxiety levels among students. Excessive pressure to perform well can lead to burnout, depression, and other mental health issues. Furthermore, it can lead to a negative self-image and a lack of confidence in one's abilities.\n\nIn addition, competition can foster a culture of individualism, which can be detrimental in the long run. When students work hard to outshine their peers, they may prioritize their own success over the needs of others. This can lead to a lack of empathy, cooperation and teamwork skills, which are also critical in today's work environment.\n\nMoreover, competition can demotivate students who do not perform well in competitive environments. Students who do not achieve the top positions can become disengaged from learning and lose interest in the subject matter. This can also lead to feelings of inadequacy and failure.\n\nIn conclusion, competition in education can be effective when it is balanced and used appropriately. While it can motivate students and promote important social skills, it can also lead to stress and a negative self-image. Educators and policymakers should strive for a collaborative learning environment that fosters teamwork skills, empathy and cooperation while still providing motivation for students to excel. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of educators and policymakers to determine what approach best fits the needs of their students and the goals of their educational programs.",

                ", South Korea is another country known for its extreme competitiveness in education. In South Korean schools, students often face immense pressure from parents, teachers and peers to perform well academically. This has led to a rise in the number of students suffering from stress, depression and even suicide in some extreme cases. This proves that too much competition in education, instead of being a positive motivator, can become a burden and even destructive for many students.\nFurthermore, hyper-competitiveness can also foster a sense of individualism and selfishness among students. When students are fixated on achieving higher grades or rankings, they may neglect cooperation and collaboration with their peers, leading to a lack of teamwork and ultimately affecting their ability to work with others effectively in real-life situations. In addition, excessive competition could also result in a limited view of what constitutes intelligence, as students may prioritize academic study over other important aspects of life, such as artistic pursuits or community service. Such a narrow focus would deprive students of the opportunity to develop into well-rounded individuals, which is an essential aspect of education as well.\nIn conclusion, competition in education has both positive and negative effects on students. While it can be a great motivator for students to push themselves to become better, too much competition can be a burden or even destructive. There needs to be a balance between competition and cooperation in the education system to ensure that students can develop into well-rounded individuals able to contribute positively to society. At the end of the day, education should aim to develop not just intelligence, but also character, values, and life skills in students, all of which are essential for their success in life.",
                ", there have also been cases of suicides in South Korea, where high school students were under immense pressure to do well in their studies and exams. Furthermore, too much emphasis on competition in education might lead to students' prioritizing results over learning. They become fixated on getting top grades instead of truly understanding the material being taught, or seeking to learn about subjects they are interested in. This can lead to a devastating effect where they become disconnected from their own learning process, and eventually bore into them; no longer enjoying the process of learning or discovering new things. As such, the education system should be designed in such a way that fosters growth and curiosity in the students, instead of transforming the whole motive of learning into a race that only focuses on obtaining high grades.\nFurthermore, excessive competitiveness cannot only harm students but also lead to societal failures. Competition can cause rifts among students which will eventually lead to discrimination on various grounds like race, socioeconomic status or even personality traits. Students who are able to score better grades might end up bullying their peers who are unable to do the same, leading to an unhealthy culture of discrimination and harassment. This is counterproductive in the intention of education in schools in the first place, where all students need to have equal opportunities to learn and grow regardless of who they are. Therefore, we need to question the effectiveness of competition in promoting education for individual enhancement as well as societal growth.\nTo conclude, competition in education is important to an extent as it encourages students to push themselves to do better and be better. But excess of competition needs to be avoided as it can cause more harm than good. The education system needs to prioritise the importance of character building to raise individuals that society truly needs, rather than focusing solely on getting good grades and test scores. We need to recognize that education is not merely a means to an end, but a lifelong process of learning and growing; it is only then we will see the true fruits of education.",
                ", in South Korea, there have been cases where students have committed suicide due to the immense pressure to excel in their studies and maintain their ranking in school. This only shows that an overemphasis on competition in education can have severe negative effects on the mental health and wellbeing of students.\nMoreover, competition in education also breeds an environment of hostility and toxic behaviour. This toxic culture is exemplified by the phenomenon of \"cyberbullying\", where students harass and demean their peers online when they perform poorly in their studies. This creates a hostile learning environment that can be detrimental to a student's ability to learn and be motivated to do better. Therefore, while competition can be healthy, safeguards need to be put in place to ensure that competition does not spiral out of control and create a toxic learning environment.\nIn conclusion, competition is an essential factor in effective education. It motivates students to do better and pushes them to their fullest potential. However, there must be measures put in place to ensure that excessive competition does not occur since it can lead to a toxic environment and negative effects on students' mental health. Ultimately, education should be about developing people of character who can contribute to society, rather than breeding an environment of toxic elitism and hyper-competitiveness.",
                ", South Korea is also known for its high-pressure education system which has resulted in an alarming suicide rate among students. In addition, too much focus on competition can lead to a high-stress environment and lowers self-esteem. Students might start comparing themselves to their peers constantly which can lead to a feeling of inferiority and demotivation; all of which detract instead of develop good character and values. It is therefore of utmost importance that the competition in the education system is monitored to ensure that the environment is one that promotes healthy competition without causing undue stress or pressure to students.\nIn conclusion, competition has both its benefits and drawbacks in education. It is essential to have competition in our education system as it provides motivation, sets goals and encourages personal growth and perseverance. However, on the other hand, excessive competition can cause stress, anxiety and other psychological issues among students. Therefore, it is critical to strike a balance between competition and a conducive learning environment in schools and colleges, by administering the right dosage of competition to ensure that students get the best out of their education without any negative consequences.",
                ", in South Korea and Japan, students are known to spend relentless hours studying and attending after-school classes, leading to psychological problems such as anxiety and depression. This emphasises how an excessive competitive culture may lead to an unhealthy distress among students.\nMoreover, competition may also cause students to have the wrong priorities and values in life. To emerge as a winner and beat their peers, students may resort to cheating, taking shortcuts and playing dirty in order to outperform their peers. The end result is that they may have good grades but not a good character. For instance, during national exams in Bangladesh in recent years, it was discovered that widespread cheating had taken place with hidden scripts, and teachers who aided the students in orchestrating the cheating were arrested. This highlights the risks of when we place excess emphasis on competition, as people may resort to morally corrupt actions just to fulfill their desire to attain the top positions.\nIn conclusion, while competition may expeditiously create an environment that prompts students to excel in their studies, the harmful aspects of being overly fixated on performance, particularly when tied to self-identification or one's future, may lead to detrimental character development. Therefore, we need to have a balance between competition and encouragement for mutual growth of students, which centres on academic excellence through fostering cooperation and interdependence between students. This allows students to learn from and grow with each other , ensuring that they retain a positive outlook on life, promote ethical values, and eventually cultivate into well-rounded individuals with good character.",
                ", there have also been similar cases found in South Korea, Japan, and even the United States, where students resort to cheating and taking stimulants just to keep up with the competition. This highlights the dangerous effects of competition, particularly when it is so intense that students feel that they must go to any extreme to succeed.\nApart from that, excessive competition can also result in negative effects like increased stress, anxiety, and depression among students. This is because when students are constantly competing against one another, it becomes hard for them to see their peers as friends- instead, they are seen purely as competitors. This can lead to loneliness and isolation, as well as a lack of teamwork skills that is so important in today's world. Furthermore, competition in the classroom causes students to focus mainly on memorizing facts and figures, rather than truly understanding the concepts and being able to apply them in real-life situations. This can result in educations that is more about cramming for exams and less about learning for the sake of personal growth.\nIn conclusion, while competition can be essential for effective education, it is important to not let it go too far. The education system must be designed such that competition is encouraged, but not to the extent where students feel that they must succeed at all costs. Instead, it must promote a healthy balance that encourages personal growth, teamwork, and an understanding of the importance of education beyond just good grades. Ultimately, it is vital that students are taught the value of hard work, dedication, and perseverance, and that competition in the classroom is just one way to cultivate these values.",
                ", this hyper-competitive culture is also present in countries like South Korea and Japan where students have reportedly resorted to suicides due to the immense pressure placed on them to perform well academically. Clearly, too much competition creates an unhealthy and toxic environment for students, and also hampers their overall development and mental health. Thus, it is essential that safeguards need to be incorporated to ensure that competition is balanced and healthy for all students involved.\nIn conclusion, competition can be beneficial for education if it is practiced in moderation. When competition is balanced, students are pushed to be their best in their studies and in life. However, we need to keep in mind that competition can also become toxic, leading to non-beneficial outcomes. Thus, it is vital that only appropriate levels of competition are introduced in the education system, measures put in place to prevent obsessions over grades and rankings, and that students' holistic development is emphasized. Only then can competition truly serve its purpose in molding individuals of character who can make positive contributions to society.",
                ", this issue is also prevalent in other countries like South Korea and Japan, where students are under immense pressure to perform well in order to secure a good job position in the future. There have been countless cases of students committing suicide or experiencing mental breakdowns due to the immense pressure of studies. The excessive emphasis on competition also leads to the neglect of other important values like teamwork, empathy, and social skills. This is because the sole focus of the education system may become centered on individual achievement, rather than the holistic development of each student. Therefore, it is crucial for competition to be balanced and regulated such that it does not become excessive and detrimental to students' mental health.\nIn conclusion, it can be seen that competition plays a crucial role in the effective education of students by providing motivation and encouraging self-improvement. However, competition needs to be balanced and regulated such that it does not become excessive and unhealthy. This can be done through the exertion of greater emphasis on holistic development of students, collaboration with the school system, and allocation of resources and time for co-curricular activities. With these safeguards in place, competition can truly elevate the performance and character of students towards the goal of providing a well-rounded education that prepares students for life in the modern-day society.",
                ", there are also cases in other countries where students resort to cheating, taking drugs, or even suicide due to the intense pressure to perform well in their studies. This highlights how excessive competition in education can be detrimental to the well-being of students, and how it can discourage creative thinking and cooperative learning, which are essential in today's ever-growing economy.\nIn conclusion, while competition is an essential element in the education system, it should be regulated to prevent it from becoming unhealthy. Safeguards such as counseling and mentorship programs should be put in place to ensure that the impact of competition on students is positive and not negative. At the same time, it is important to remember that intellectual pursuits should also involve collaboration, and that knowledge should be used to benefit society at large, and not just for the individual's benefit. Only then can education fulfill its goal of helping students develop character and contribute positively towards society.",
                ", South Korea is another country where competition is exceedingly intense. It is not uncommon for students to attendextra tuition classes for more than 14 hours a day, or even resorting to taking drugs to improve concentration levels in order to excel academically. This has led to students being overstressed and pressured to the point of experiencing mental health issues. Therefore, it is evident that excessive competition causes students to lose sight of the true purpose of education, which is to develop character and become contributing members of society. It is particularly concerning when children are pressured to excel, as they may not understand the repercussions of their actions, which could lead to stress-related health issues in their adolescent and adult years.\nIn conclusion, competition is essential for effective education to a certain extent, as it motivates students to do better in their studies and aids them in squeezing out their potential. However, too much competition can prompt negative outcomes like theappealing to cheating and excess stress, which could ultimately cause students to lose focus on what true education means. Therefore, it is important for educators to find a balance for the right amount of competition, with proper safeguards to prevent an excessively competitive ecosystem."

            "human_gen_truncate": "tivism\", referring to measures that require minimal personal effort and have little practical effect beyond allowing people to derive satisfaction from the feeling that they have contributed. Social media gives people the ability to share information with a great many others, be it details of a certain cause, a viral video highlighting pertinent social issues, or evidence about one'sawareness about the situation \u2013 literally with a click of a button. Lamentably, this power exacerbates the \"]\"slacktivism\" problem as it makes people believe that they helped out on a social cause simply by sharing things over social media, rather than doing something practical. One pertinent example would be the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, meant to raise awareness and funds to aid those afflicted with Lou Gehrig'sdisease (which severely impairs motor activity). In the challenge, participants could choose between making a cash donation or the actual \"ice bucket\" challenge \u2013 and most opted for the latter, believing that it could make as much of a difference as a cash donation, while being more fun. In creating videos of themselves pouring iced water over their heads, people placed high value on their efforts spent and falsely perceive such an act as a substitute for more concrete action such as donating or volunteering to help out victims personally. Regrettably, social media may cause people to overrate their actions and feel that they have done tremendously to help out on certain societal causes when all they have done is post something related to the issue at hand.\nOf course, while a significant proportion of individuals are unwilling to put in concrete action towards social change, there is still a number of people who wish to do more. This is where social media serves as a first step towards greater accomplishments. With its ability to gather a sizeable target audience, in unprecedented magnitudes compared to that of television or newspapers, many more people are now aware of various social causes, which gives much more opportunities to engage people beyond mere understanding. A case in point would be that of Canadian Craig Kielburger, the founder of \"Free the Children\" (an organization that helps build schools worldwide). Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who \"liked\" the organisation'sFacebook page, only 2,000 committed to a trip overseas to help the cause. Even so, Kielburger was in praise of social media, stating that it \"opens the megaphone so much wider\u2026 when you finally look at that spectrum, we\"ve got more people who are finally making that journey\". Kielburger'sexample highlights the effectiveness of social media as a pilot for actions towards social change.\nAll in all, many cases have demonstrated the power of a single click when said click is accompanied by similar clicks from a great many other individuals. While a significant proportion of individuals passively receive and pass on information over social media, a sizeable them are willing to do more than just spread news. As such, social media has indeed attained its intention of being a catalyst of social change, whatever its scale.",

However, platforms like Twitter and Instagram have made it possible for individuals to share personal experiences and advocate for their rights. For example, survivors of sexual assault have used the #MeToo hashtag to share their stories and highlight the pervasiveness of sexual violence.\n\nDespite its advantages, social media activism has its limitations. One of the critiques of social media activism is that it can lead to slacktivism, where people participate in online activism without taking concrete actions in the real world. For instance, individuals may share hashtags or post photos in support of a cause without actually contributing to it. This has led to criticism that social media activism is a performative form of activism that does not lead to actual change.\n\nMoreover, social media activism faces the challenge of filtering out the noise and ensuring that the right messages are being amplified. Due to the sheer volume of content on social media, it can be difficult to differentiate between genuine activism and superficial activism. There are cases where fake accounts and bots have been created to spread false information and disrupt genuine activism.\n\nIn conclusion, social media activism has proven to be a powerful tool for raising awareness, mobilizing people and giving marginalized groups a platform to voice their concerns. While there are limitations such as slacktivism and information overload, it should not detract from the potential that social media activism has in bringing about change. As long as people are aware of social media's limitations and take concrete actions to bring about change in the real world, social media activism can be effective in driving social change, creating a more just and equal society.",

It is the notion that social media activism induces people to take the easier route of \"liking\" a post or signing an online petition, instead of taking concrete action in the physical world. As Dr. Pamela Rutledge, director of the Media Psychology Research Center notes, \"a like doesn't change conditions on the ground, but it can create a network effect of millions of likes, which can lead to exposure, which can lead to influence.\" In that respect, it can be argued that social media has the power to influence a person's thinking or even sway the opinion of society at large on issues. In fact, this sway may even be increased given that social media's innate power to selectively display content to a user through algorithms can craft a certain narrative or highlight certain issues as more important vis-a-vis others. Even as detractors may argue that social media activism is ineffective because it may create this phenomenon of slacktivism, it still appears that social media activism has the potential to mobilise people to a cause that they would otherwise have hitherto been ignorant about.\nUltimately, while activism through social media has its pros and cons, it would be incorrect to claim that it is ineffective. The power of social media to quickly and broadly spread messages to millions of people, combined with the unique opportunity to provide an accessible voice for marginalised individuals make social media an effective tool for activism. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise that social media should not be seen as a replacement for physical activism and helping the cause in the real world remains crucial. Ultimately, the effectiveness of social media activism should be seen as an extension of traditional activism, one that has the potential to bring about tangible change in society that would have otherwise been difficult to achieve.",

Moreover, social media activism may also be criticised for its potential to create an \"echo chamber\" effect, where individuals are only exposed to viewpoints that they are already inclined to agree with, which further polarises opinion among groups. This may be detrimental to affecting real change, as there needs to be engagement with and outreach to those that disagree with one's viewpoint in order to move towards compromise and resolution of issues. Nevertheless, some argue that even if slacktivism does exist, the potential reach and impact of social media activism cannot be dismissed, as seen in the example of Shawn Ahmed, where his use of social media generated tangible results for the village. \n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the effectiveness of social media activism is dependent on several factors. While detractors may argue that the potential for slacktivism and echo chambers may dilute the impact of social media activism, the outreach of social media cannot be ignored. The power of social media to reach millions across the world, raise awareness and incentivise individuals towards concrete action, demonstrated in the success of Shawn Ahmed's efforts. Therefore, social media activism, when executed with the right intentions, message and outreach strategies can be highly effective in inciting change and promoting social justice.",
                "tivism\" which is defined as the act of liking, sharing or retweeting a cause without necessarily committing to any action or further involvement. Critics argue that it is not enough for an individual just to share a post on social media platforms; they must take more active steps and be physically involved. While this notion of slacktivism may hold some weight, I hold the view that this is a narrow-minded stance. It cannot be denied that social media has been used to bring forth tangible results that would not have been possible without social media activism. Take, for example, the Arab Spring revolutions in which social media was pivotal in gathering people into action and toppling totalitarian regimes; or the #MeToo campaign which brought worldwide attention to the issue of sexual harassment and sexual assault. These movements gained substantial momentum through social media activism, despite some users' inaction. Moreover, social media activism has a ripple effect. As awareness grows on social media, individuals are stimulated to seek out more information on issues and become involved on a larger scale, which cannot be dismissed as inaction. Ultimately, the success of social media activism can be seen in the resulting concrete change projects, which is proof that social media has the potential to accomplish much more than just superficial temporary trends.\nIn conclusion, social media activism's effectiveness is almost unquestionable, as it is an extremely efficient medium to convey information and incentivize individuals to help out, achieve results and bring awareness to pressing matters. However, it is important to acknowledge the issue of slacktivism, but this should not detract from the numerous examples of social media sparking action and achieving tangible results. It would be unwise to underestimate the resounding effects of social media which allow us to transcend physical boundaries, unite with like-minded people and work towards a better world.",
                "tivism\", to describe individuals who engage in minimalistic clicks like \"liking\" a post or \"retweeting\" a hashtag without actually providing concrete aid to any cause. However, this problem is significantly overstated, as it neglects the fact that social media activism generally functions as a catalyst for physical participation. Individuals inspired through social media may not directly participate in physical protests on the streets, but they may contribute their resources, or engage in indirect supportive activities that further the cause, such as spreading information to friends and family members whom they may persuade to take action as well. Further, the exponential spread of information and ideas through social media creates a sense of cohesiveness and concomitantly, a sense of accountability whereby individuals feel that their actions or inaction will be noted by a larger audience. This is an effective incentive for individuals to participate in activism efforts that may eventually have meaningful results, like pressure on governments to adopt better social welfare policies or inducing corporations to take on more socially responsible policies. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are doubts of the effectiveness of social media activism, it has clearly played and will continue to play an important role as a mobiliser for social change. With the ability to convey information and inspire individuals to participate and take action, there is no doubt that social media activism is a viable and effective form of activism in today's digitally-driven world.",
                "tivism\", indicating that individuals who participate in activism on social media channels may only do so passively, without truly grasping the depth of the situation and without leaving their homes. After all, it is easy to simply share a post, like a status, or retweet a tweet without truly making a difference to the world. However, this view is only a partial aspect of the broader picture since it disregards the fact that social media activism has been effective in catalysing positive actions beyond the platform it is circulated on. For instance, following the savage murder of George Floyd, #BlackLivesMatter trended worldwide across social media platforms. While some detractors accused the hashtag trend to be purely symbolic and performative, a slew of concrete actions arose from this social media trend. Corporates, music labels, film studios, and sports franchises donated millions of dollars towards organisations and initiatives fighting racial inequality, among other actions like community protests and reform initiatives. The hashtag trend played a vital role in spreading awareness and moving towards wider support for anti-racism activism. While it alone did not change the world, it served as a useful platform to begin a larger conversation that fostered effective change.\nIn conclusion, while social media activism may have its drawbacks, its outcomes have proved to be effective, helping to create a wider audience and generate awareness on issues that may have been previously regarded as being ignored. Thus, while it might not act as the solution to the problem at hand, social media serves instead as a powerful tool, effectively mobilising the public, and starting the conversation. It is definitely clear that the benefits outweigh the negatives, proving to us that social media activism is a positive movement that can change and inspire the world.",
                "tivism\", and refers to the act of individuals clicking \"like\" or \"share\" on posts that promote social change without taking any real, concrete action towards the cause. While this is certainly a valid concern, it is important to note that social media activism is not solely predicated upon virtual actions. Rather, social media serves as a catalyst to incite physical actions to occur. For instance, during the Arab Spring, social media played a crucial role in organizing a multitude of physical sit-ins and protests. Social media can also serve as an effective fundraising tool that helps to raise money for a particular cause. The \"ice bucket challenge\", for example, was a viral campaign that took place in the summer of 2014 and involved individuals posting videos of themselves having ice water dumped on their heads, with the aim of raising money for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) research. Over the course of the challenge, over $115 million was raised worldwide for the said research, proving that with its potential for massive outreach, social media can indeed facilitate tangible results for social change.\nIn conclusion, social media activism can indeed be effective in promoting social change as it possesses the ability to reach a vast audience, making it an advantageous vehicle through which to promote a certain cause or bring attention to a social issue. While concerns of slacktivism may limit the effectiveness of social media activism, it should be acknowledged that social media also serves as a catalyst for tangible, physical actions such as fundraising and the organization of protests.",
                "tivism\", and refers to the situation where individuals simply click a \"like\" button or share a post without contributing anything of tangible value toward the cause. These detractors argue that the lack of physical action committed to effect change ultimately renders all efforts through social media as practically ineffective. While there is certainly some truth to these claims, it does not lessen the impact of social media as a tool for social change. In fact, social media can be an effective gateway for individuals to get involved in social issues. Many individuals who discover social issues through social media often take the extra step to become more involved, and eventually participate in other forms of activism. Take for example the \"Ice Bucket Challenge\" that went viral on Facebook in 2014. While some criticised the movement as being simply \"slacktivism\", it resulted in millions of dollars in donations toward research for a cure of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These donations were made not only by those who clicked the \"like\" button or shared the post but also those who actually took the challenge by dumping buckets of ice on themselves while making donations as well. This is proof that even if the \"slacktivism\" effect may occur in social media activism, those who support the social issue can still translate the mere online support into actual physical participation. Consequently, social media activism makes it easier for individuals to affiliate with social movements and join marches, protests, and other physical forms of protests, contributing to social change in a more practical and tangible way.\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly those who doubt the effectiveness of social media activism, it is clear that social media can serve as an effective tool for social activism and have a positive impact on social issues. By reaching a massive global audience, social media has the power to create awareness of, and concern toward, socially pressing issues. While it may be true that online support may not lead to physical action, it cannot be denied that social media is a powerful catalyst for social advocacy and also an effective gateway that leads to individuals becoming more involved in social activism in general.",
                "tivism\", which refers to the tendency of people to only participate in superficial or non-committal activism online through simple tasks like liking or sharing a post, signing an online petition, or changing their profile picture to support a certain cause without actually taking real-world action. This phenomenon can result in the dilution of the effectiveness of social media activism as it only really results in a virtual echo chamber with no concrete action being taken. Moreover, since social media is largely unregulated, social media activism can also be impacted by fake news and propaganda that can come from individuals and organisations with malign intentions, reducing its credibility as a means of promoting social change. However, I believe that these problems are not exclusive to social media activism but are applicable to any form of activism, both digital and physical. To dismiss the effectiveness of social media activism, simply because of its potential for the \"slacktivist\" culture that it may foster or due to issues of personal agenda setting, is unreasonable. Social media still allows for real-world impact, and the existence of \"slacktivist\" tendencies does not necessarily render activism attempts futile.\nOverall, the efficacy of social media activism is ultimately subjective, and the effectiveness of such types of activism would depend on the nature of the cause and a myriad of other factors that contribute to social change. However, the role that social media plays in activism is undeniable, and the potential it holds in driving advocacy for a cause is noteworthy.",
                "tivism\", implying that social media activism may be a passive form of activism that encourages virtual participation over actual action. Critics argue that clicking on a \"like\" button or signing an online petition does not equate to tangible results, as such actions require little to no effort from the participator. However, this criticism rings hollow, as it ignores the fact that these actions can still prompt concrete changes. For example, the online campaign by the animal rights group, PETA, against the use of fur saw results when advertisers and designers began to drop their use of fur in their products, influenced by the increasing demand of consumers who listened to the campaigns. The campaign started on Twitter with the trending hashtag #MakeFurHistory, and grew into a movement that reached governments, celebrities and the public -- all through social media. Such activism initiatives on social media have caught the attention of politicians, governments and corporates, who now pay attention to such activities on social media when devising new policies. Additionally, social media has facilitated coordination and organization among supporters, allowing them to share crowdfunding campaigns, organise rallies and public meetings, thereby rallying more support behind causes.\n\nIn conclusion, it can be seen that social media activism is an effective tool for activism, as it has the power to spread information and begin a chain reaction towards social change. Despite criticisms of \"slacktivism,\" social media activism has been able to bring attention to various social causes and prompt a significant number of people to care enough about them to contribute, donate, or organise into groups to fight for change. With the ability to garner an international audience and rally real support toward a cause, social media activism has proven to be a viable means of taking meaningful action.",
                "tivism\", which refers to the minimal effort expended when clicking the \"Like\" or \"Share\" button on social media platforms. This minimal effort does not translate into concrete action towards the cause advocated by the activism effort. Critics argue that social media activists tend to prioritize sharing information about an issue over actually helping solve it, which undermines the effectiveness of activism done through social media. Nevertheless, while this may be true to some extent, it is important to acknowledge that social media does play a significant role in raising awareness and igniting discussion around social issues. The increased visibility of these social issues also contributes to their being held accountable and addressed by individuals and institutions in positions of power, thereby making social media activism a worthwhile effort.\n\nIn conclusion, it cannot be denied that social media activism has transformed the way we perceive and undertake activism. While it has its shortcomings, the ability of social media to reach out to a large audience and inspire them to act upon issues they may not have been aware of before makes it an effective and valuable tool for social change."

However, in societies where academic performance is prized, schoolchildren are paying a heavy price. While Singapore has been largely successful in global education rankings, constantly ranking one of the top 5 nations globally, at the same time students in Singapore are reporting symptoms of anxiety and stress related to school as early as primary school, and there have been extreme cases where pupils have been driven to suicide. Youths often face long days at school, hours of homework, and extra classes, which are having an impact on mental wellbeing. A recent report by OECD found that overall, the nation'spupils reported higher levels of anxiety than average. In Japan, 659 Japanese aged 20 or under died by their own hand in 2019, which was an increase of 60 from the year before. In China, children as young as five are pushed hard in sporting arenas and studies. Even in Singapore, toddlers as young as eight months old are attending lessons and enrichment classes.\nAt the other end of the demographic spectrum, \"retirement\" is a word that many look forward to, where one can be happy and stress-free after a lifetime of work. However, in today'ssociety, the elderly are also not as happy as they should be. It is true that the elderly lead more comfortable lives as compared to one or two generations ago. Their children work hard to provide for them and they also are eligible for subsidies from the government. Hence, the elderly are able to spend their retirement years without having to worry much about daily necessities. Yet, in Singapore, the number of elderly people taking their own lives reached a record high in 2017. Some 129 people aged 60 and older committed suicide, despite the total number of suicides declining in the same year. Those who are sick, have little or no family or dependent help and are socially isolated may be more susceptible. This is because most would not want to be a burden to others as most adult children lead busy lives and may not be able to give as much attention to parents as the elderly need. The social interaction and emotional support they require are not there and therefore, elderly isolation has caused many elderly to feel unhappy and some are even driven to the brink of depression.\nHowever, not all hope is lost, as happiness still can be attained today due to the government'sefforts to raise the level of happiness in the country. In the recent Covid-19 outbreak, the government implemented social distancing to help Singapore cope with reducing the spread of the virus. However, social distancing has been hard on many, especially the vulnerable and the elderly. Hence, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) has deployed volunteers to help this segment of society in many ways such as picking up their groceries and accompanying them for hospital appointments. These volunteers call the elderly citizens once every week to check in on them, and these elderly often quote that it is good to have someone to chat with them. This shows that the government has done much to provide the elderly in Singapore with companionship and assistance, ensuring that their well-being is being looked after in their retirement years.\nIn the final analysis, we may face many problems in today'sworld, with rising costs of living as well as the presence of many conflicts in the world. The stress and pressure of society acting on people can result in them not being happy, and even the benefits we have today may actually be a source of sadness. However, we do have a choice, to be satisfied with what we have. Despite the problems we face, we can choose to be happy.

The 2019 World Happiness Report highlighted that all regions in the world, except for North America, have shown a decline in happiness levels. The report also pointed out that social support, trust in government and a sense of personal freedom are crucial factors that contribute to happiness.

            "human_gen_truncate": " Hence, this makes the pursuit of the Arts not an option but an integral part of the growth of the people in promoting the emotional wellbeing of individuals in a stressful and demanding world.\nAt the same time, the increasingly apathetic culture of men and the diminishing role of religion in many people'slives have also disrupted our moral compass. In truth, the Arts are now increasingly recognized for its soft power and ability to reach out to matters of the heart and shaping our moral beliefs and teaching us new things. The Arts have always been respected for its profundity and its ability to provoke and stimulate one in unleashing one'smoral values such as compassion, grace, forgiveness, humane, humility and so forth. For instance, the intellectually-stimulating art piece of the \"Age of Innocence\" painting which subsequently founded the novel itself does provoke thoughts among readers in defining their definition of innocence and forces them to reconsider the various aspects behind morality with that of social acceptability. In addition, new dramas such as \"Mrs Warren'sProfession\" by George Bernard Shaw written in the late Victorian period seeks to confront the traditional perceptions and attitudes towards prostitution by portraying the protagonist'smother as one who resorted to it not by choice but by circumstance, causing us to sympathize with her and acknowledging the ills of our capitalist system. The Arts is therefore an effective tool in contributing to the moralistic and ethical development of people in society and engineering strong notions of values and culture, which in some ways is also reflective of our way of life. Thus, the moral qualities that the Arts brings make it not an option but an integral part of the growth of the people in shaping one'smoral discernment.\nIn addition, the role of the Arts in our exercise of our freedom of speech in this increasingly pluralistic world is imperative in us arguing for the need of the Arts in our daily lives in expressing our right and view to things. Through the ability to exercise our freedom of speech we are able to bring about new changes in improving the lives of others. The Arts, which can take place in different forms such as government feedback channels like the \"Daily Talks\" which flames Trump and his policies or even citizenry platforms such as REACH forums in Singapore allows for greater participation in society which promotes a more inclusive and integrated society in fostering stronger national bonds and unity among fellow citizens. These channels of the Arts or even in local films such as \"Ah Boys to Men\" by renowned local producer Jack Neo also seeks to express his personal thoughts of what every Singaporean man will have to experience in National Service, which is vital in reinforcing the cultural identity and national belonging to one'snative country and calls for society with greater social cohesion in it. Yet, while the Arts allow for the freedom of expression, it should be recognized that this should be conducted along with personal discretion in promoting social cohesion. In the established reporting of the Charlie Hebdo incident, the social satirical magazine that mocked the prophet Mohammad experienced severe backlash for its inappropriateness and insensitivity to Islam. Hence, the Arts while on the pretext of preserving and enabling freedom of expression should also be closely regulated in order to not endanger social cohesion and promote internal strife. Thus, the room for freedom of expression, if carefully regulated, makes the pursuit of the arts not an option but an integral part in the growth of the people.\nSince time immemorial, the Arts have always been regarded as one that was secondary to that of meeting the basic needs as iterated under Maslow'shierarchy of needs. However, in an increasingly affluent and stressful world, the need for the Arts has become vital and important among people across the world due to the benefits bestowed upon the emotional, moral and the sense of national belonging in an individual.",

Through this critical thinking process, individuals gain a better understanding of their own beliefs and values and learn to appreciate diverse perspectives. This perspective broadening is critical to enhancing communication, creating understanding, and promoting empathy in a diverse society.\n\nThe 21st century is characterized by a rapidly changing socio-economic landscape, and with the onset of technological advancements and digitalization, there is a growing need to inculcate creativity, adaptability, and invention in individuals. The Arts provide individuals with an opportunity to think creatively, fostering innovation, and developing ideas outside the box that can be applied across different aspects of society. The pursuit of artistic expression plays a critical role in making individuals well-rounded beings that can tackle real-world challenges in novel ways.\n\nIn conclusion, The Arts are essential to personal development, intellectual growth, and societal progress. They have the potential to elicit critical thinking and self-awareness and facilitate the development of creativity and innovation, essential skills needed in today's dynamic society. Therefore, The pursuit of The Arts should not be relegated to an option but should be an integral part of human growth and development.

Artistic expressions are often avenues through which individuals can convey their messages or awareness of social issues to society. Be it through film, music, literature, painting, or sculpture, the Arts have played an influential role in raising awareness of matters such as the plight of the marginalized communities, issues of gender inequality, sexuality, and political oppression. These matters are crucial in navigating the moral compass of individuals in society. Through artistic expressions, these issues can be addressed through thought-provoking pieces that seek to scrutinize and examine these social issues critically, and this helps shape how individuals view and approach such matters in society. For example, the recent Singaporean film \"A Land Imagined\" brought attention to the plight of migrant workers in Singapore and their often-overlooked contributions to the economy. The film raised awareness and provided a platform for discussion, thereby encouraging individuals to form a critical stance on migrant workers' conditions in Singapore. The Arts are hence crucial in shaping the moral and ethical standards of the people.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the Arts is no longer an option but instead an integral part of the growth of people. The Arts play a critical role in providing for our emotional and mental well-being, developing our moral and ethical standards, and offering a source of catharsis and relief from societal stresses.

                "In addition to the emotional and psychological benefits, the Arts also play a significant role in nurturing the moral stance of mankind. The Arts offer a platform for individuals to examine societal norms and issues such as socio-economic inequality, religious and cultural discrimination, and other social ills. Not surprisingly, the Arts have thus played a critical role in pushing for social reforms in the past, playing a large role in the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, or the Women's Suffrage movement in the UK. More recently, movies like Pan's Labyrinth, Moneyball and Argo among others have offered strong socio-political messages that have become talking points around the world. In Singapore, the Arts have played a significant role in raising awareness on important social issues such as meritocracy, inclusivity, and social mobility, not just among the masses but policymakers as well. The Arts are critical to fostering and nurturing the moral tenet of society, something that is essential as economic prosperity can only take a country so far without the compassion, empathy and social awareness to generate sustainable growth.\nIn conclusion, therefore, the pursuit of the Arts is no longer a mere option but a critical requirement to the growth of people. The Arts offer an invaluable way of dealing with the emotional and psychological stresses of the modern world, acting as a source of catharsis that alleviates many of the mental pressures of modern society. Additionally, the Arts offer a Trojan Horse for social reform and progress through the imparting of moral tenets and awareness on societal issues that cannot be achieved through other platforms such as STEM. The Arts are, therefore, necessary in achieving sustainable growth for a society, the realization of the full potential of mankind, and provide a much-desired human touch to the progress that many rightly desire in this competitive and fast-paced world.",

The Arts act as a beacon of inspiration, motivating people to make a difference, and strive towards goodness and excellence. It also provides a platform for people to express their thoughts and ideas boldly, without fear of judgment or suppression. For instance, the Arts have been used as a vehicle to stimulate conversations about social issues like racism, sexism, and inequality, thereby spreading awareness and mobilizing people towards a positive change. Hence, the Arts serve as a powerful tool, capable of shaping people's perception of the world and inspiring them to make a meaningful difference.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the Arts should be viewed as an integral part of the growth of people. The Arts provide a room of escape in this stressful world, contributing to emotional and mental well-being, as well as shaping the moral stance of mankind and acting as a platform for expression. The notion that the Arts are a frivolous pursuit with no practical implication is an unfounded statement that downplays the significance of art in society. The Arts have, and will continue to play a crucial role in the development of society, and we must recognize its significance and strive towards fostering an environment that prioritizes the Arts in all its manifestations.",

In Singapore's inclusive and diverse society, it is vital for people to be able to understand and appreciate other cultures, beliefs and ideas that are different from their own. The Arts plays a critical role in facilitating this process. For example, literature, which is a form of art, exposes people to different perspectives, cultures and ways of living, thereby enabling them to have a better understanding and acceptance of these differences. Theatre productions also deal with issues, problems and dilemmas that mirror our own society, thereby invoking people to be more reflective and empathetic towards people living through these realities. In this way, the Arts play a critical role in broadening the individual's moral and philosophical thinking and enabling them to interact more efficiently and effectively in a diverse and pluralistic world.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the Arts is no longer an option but an integral part to the growth of people, as it enhances the emotional, moral and educational aspects of individuals, thereby enabling them to be better adapted and diversified in an evolving and challenging world. Hence, it is critical for people in Singapore and globally, to embrace the Arts, play an active role in its development and ensure its continuance and proliferation for generations to come.",
                "Furthermore, the Arts also play a critical role in developing the moral stance of human beings. As individuals, we are often influenced by many factors around us that have a significant impact on our moral and ethical values. Thus, the Arts which is often sensationalized, highlights and brings to light many social, cultural, and economic issues that plague not just Singapore but also the wider world. The Arts thus serve as a platform for individuals and audiences to confront and engage with the issues that are affecting society. For instance, the recent Malaysian comedy hit movie \"Polis Evo\" tackles themes of corruption and graft, exposing societal ills and moral failings, thereby bettering the human moral conscience in the process. Through grappling with societal issues, Singaporeans are provoked to think critically and deeply about their values and the values of their society. It galvanizes them towards standing for what they believe\u201d and taking a proactive stance towards moral issues that plague our society.\nTherefore, it is evident that the Arts are not just a mere luxury that individuals could do without. Rather, the Arts are integral to the lives of people, providing the essential balance in the emotion, mental, and moral well-being of people. As Singapore propels itself through rapid economic development, it is vital that policymakers, corporations, and individuals do not overlook the significance of the Arts in our lives. Hence, the Arts should continue to be pursued fervently as an integral part of the growth of individuals.",

The Arts serve as an essential means of enriching an individual's soul and promoting the interconnectedness between different individuals. In essence, the Arts are a reflection of the people and society as a whole, and by providing individuals with a holistic view of different cultures and perspectives, the Arts contribute significantly to the building of a person\u2019s moral compass. The Arts teach individuals to empathize with others and to better understand their emotions and perspectives. As such, the Arts are critical in shaping an individual's moral stance and contribute in molding them into compassionate and humane beings who appreciate and value the diversity of the human experience.\nLastly, the Arts also provoke thoughts towards social issues and spark conversations about matters that are of concern to society. The Arts provide an avenue for individuals to express themselves fully in matters that affect them and the people around them. In this way, the Arts act as a watchdog for society and empower individuals to speak up against injustices. It is no coincidence that many profound works of literature and art have had a significant impact on social and political movements throughout history. The Arts thus contribute in equipping individuals with the tools necessary to effect meaningful positive change in society.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the pursuit of the Arts is an integral part of the growth of the people. The Arts provide emotional and moral nourishment, promote the interconnectedness between people and societies, and provoke thoughts on social issues that are of significance to society as a whole. As Singapore continues to develop and progress, the government, organizations, and society at large should continue to prioritize the Arts and invest in them accordingly, for the betterment of the people.",
                "Moreover, the Arts are also crucial in the moral and educational development of individuals. The Arts not only provide individuals with a platform of unrestricted expression, but also enable people to better understand the world around them. Artistic performances, such as theatre, music or dance performances are not just about presenting the audience with entertainment. They are also an effective means of provoking thoughts towards social issues. They enable audiences to better understand society and the world we live in, by providing them with a different perspective to critically analyze and reflect upon. For example, the recent theatre production of \"The LKY Musical\" showcased to Singaporeans the struggles and challenges faced by Singapore's founding father. The production provided audiences with a different perspective towards how far Singapore has come and how grateful we should be for the hard work that was put in by our founding fathers. The Arts, therefore, have the power to inspire, shape and mould the beholder's perception while also acting as a source of education towards moral and societal issues. \n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the Arts is an essential need in promoting the psychological and emotional well-being, developing the moral stance of mankind and provoking thoughts towards social issues within individuals. While it may seem insignificant to individuals in the face of modern uncertainties, it is clear that the Arts have grown more pertinent in Singaporeans' lives especially in promoting the much-needed intangible aspects of human health. Hence, the pursuit of the Arts is undoubtedly an integral part of the growth of people.",
                "Furthermore, the Arts are also integral in developing the moral stance of individuals through the messages and themes that they convey. The Arts are not only about entertainment or the exhibition of great skill and talent. Many great works of Art, such as literature or films explore the deep-seated issues of human existence and morality. Moreover, some works of Art challenge the moral values and norms that are entrenched in societies, often leading to social change. For instance, the movie \"The Vow\" that exalts the power of true love, has inspired several people to rekindle their love and re-accept their partners. This is an excellent illustration of the impact Arts have had not only on the individual level but also community-wide. Therefore, the Arts play a critical role in shaping not only the character but also the perceptions and attitudes of individuals.\nThe Arts are also significant in provoking thoughts towards social issues. Art can be used to represent people, places, and ideas in a way that challenges long-held beliefs and stereotypes. This is because Art has no constraints on what it can express, and thus it can provide us with a more unobstructed view and reflection of life itself. For instance, Theater is an excellent way of capturing the social ills, and many great playwrights use Theater to criticize society and draw attention to injustices. The Arts can, therefore, be viewed as essential in helping people better understand themselves, the society they live in and their place in it.\nIn conclusion, the Arts contribute significantly to the emotional, moral, and intellectual development of individuals. The Arts have the potential to uplift, change and transform individuals, thereby, enhancing society as a whole. Therefore, we should not see the Arts as a mere option but as an integral part to the growth of people. It is only when we embrace the importance of the Arts that we can fully appreciate its transformative power, the privilege of having a perspective on different societal issues and the enormous influence it has on the quality of our lives.",
                "Furthermore, the Arts are essential in cultivating the moral and social betterment of individuals, which is as crucial as physical and emotional health. The Arts provide a medium of unrestricted expression for individuals to voice out their views, which could lead to the creation of more socially conscious individuals. Art is able to offer limitless ways of interpreting social issues through visual representations, performances or even music, encouraging people to question and discuss sensitive topics that are often regarded as taboo and could be used to effect social change. The Arts thus act as a critical tool towards the propagation of various social issues and challenging the point of view of the masses to reinforce the significance of social responsibility amongst individuals.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of the Arts should not be considered mere entertainment but as something that contributes to the holistic development of individuals, be it in terms of emotional, intellectual or moral growth. The Arts is a crucial part that should not be neglected in the development of individuals as it does not merely provide individuals with an avenue that serves as a relief from societal pressure but also promotes the cultivation of better social values. It is of utmost significance that society invests in the Arts to ensure that humans do not degenerate into mere machines that are only driven by the economic prospects of the world.",
                "In addition to promoting emotional and psychological well-being, the Arts also aid in the social and moral development of individuals. The Arts help individuals actualize their creativity and cultivate social skill sets that aid in their development of a more emphatic world view. Whether it be through theatre, music, literature, dance or visual arts, the Arts provide individuals with avenues to interact with people from all walks of life thus promoting social cohesion and enhancing their cultural awareness. The Arts hence encourage people to take part in projects and initiatives that have global or societal relevance such as charity drives, social activism against societal injustice and cultural exchange programs. For instance, arts festivals such as Singapore's Night Festival and Chingay Parade, provide an opportunity for individuals to interact with locals and foreigners alike and better appreciate the rich cultural diversity that exists in the world. As such, the Arts foster growth and development that is not only centered on the individual but also on the wider society.\nIn conclusion, I argue that the pursuit of the Arts is not an option but an integral part of the growth of people. The Arts are essential in fostering the emotional and psychological well-being of individuals, encouraging social interaction and developing moral and social consciousness that is paramount in the development of a holistic society. Contrary to the notion that the Arts offer little practical value in the face of economic growth in this day and age, their value to our world and our society should no longer be marginalized."

            "prompt": "ARE PEOPLE MORE WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES TODAY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "ay have resulted in uprisings and protests \u2013 done with the aim to propagate social causes. The use of social media platforms to spread political beliefs has seen the overthrow of two presidents, Hosni Murbarak and Morsi from the Egyptian government since the Arab Spring. Hence, the power of social media in championing social causes is undeniable which has led to people becoming more willing to sacrifice their lives for their causes because their sacrifices are now, at the very least, seen by the public eye. Another example would be the demonstrations that begin in Ecuador in 2019. When the government announced that it was taking public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this change led to a sharp rise in petrol prices, which many said they could not afford. Indigenous groups feared that the measure would result in increased costs for public transport and food, and that their rural communities would be hardest hit. Protesters blocked highways, stormed parliament and clashed with security forces as they demanded an end to austerity and the return of fuel subsidies. The government backed down after days of mass protests and the action came to an end. From these examples, it is clear that rising expectations that people have in ruling governments have led to increased willingness among people to make sacrifices for their causes today.\nMoreover, I agree with the view that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today because they are subjected to feelings of unjust given that they may not be entitled to certain benefits or merit goods in the country. These feelings of unfairness are further exacerbated when governments of other countries are able to provide the citizens with what they want and need, thus leading to a higher quality of life. An example to illustrate this is Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani school pupil and education activist, who is known for her activism for rights to education and for women, especially in the Swat Valley, where the Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Despite an assassination attempt to kill Yousafzai and her father by the Taliban, she continues to advocate for rights of women to education, and even spoke at the United Nations to call for worldwide access to education. Yousafzai'ssacrifice of her safety \u2013 _as shown by how the Taliban attempted to assassinate her \u2013 enabled her to further her cause to promote education for women. It was done with the aim to eradicate violation of women'sright, where a lack of provision of education to women has resulted in the unfair and inhumane treatment towards women. Another person who has made sacrifices to stand up strongly for what she believes in is 17-year-old Greta Thunberg. Thunberg began a global movement by skipping school: starting in August 2018, she spent her days camped out in front of the Swedish Parliament, holding a sign painted in black letters on a white background that read: \"School Strike for Climate Change\". In the time since, she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history. This shows the strength in Thunberg'sbelief in environmental preservation, and how she truly believes that change must happen in the world, such that she is willing to make sacrifices to inspire people to share her vision. Therefore, feelings of unjust have resulted in activists such as Malala being willing in making sacrifices which they deem to be for a worthy cause.\nIn essence, while some people may argue that people today make sacrifices because of ulterior motives that they may have such as gaining international popularity and not to simply promote their causes, my stand is that people today are more willing to make sacrifices because of a genuine need to promote their causes. The influence of celebrity culture, rising expectations of ruling governments and feelings of unfairness felt by people would further enhance their willingness to effect societal change. Therefore, it is justifiable to argue that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " issues. The recent wave of social justice movements and the significant participation of people worldwide reflect this trend, and there is no denying that people are more willing to make sacrifices today to address social issues that affect the world collectively.\n\nHowever, it is vital to acknowledge that the concept of sacrifice is subjective as it is heavily influenced by individual circumstances, socio-economic status, and cultural norms. Some people are willing to make significant sacrifices for a cause they believe in, whereas others may not share the same level of enthusiasm. This difference in attitude and aptitude towards sacrifice transcends culture, generation, or geography.\n\nFurthermore, the progressive nature of various societies and communities plays an essential role in shaping people's attitudes towards sacrifice. In some societies, being part of a community means making numerous sacrifices for the greater good. In such cases, the adults in the community would set an example of their levels of sacrifice, which the younger generation would follow. However, it is worth noting that this stereotype of younger people \"lacking a sense of community\" is not necessarily accurate. Younger generations are more attuned to global issues and are willing to contribute towards systemic change, but they may not follow the same modes of sacrifice that were seen in previous generations. \n\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to paint all people of a certain generation, or society with the same brush, regarding their willingness to make sacrifices. It is undeniable that societal progress, technological advancements, and global awareness have impacted daily life significantly, and our attitudes towards sacrifice have changed accordingly. However, each person's approach to sacrifice is highly individualistic, influenced by their beliefs, values, and social circumstances. Nonetheless, we can safely say that some issues transcend national, cultural, or generational borders, and people are more willing to make sacrifices today for causes they deem significant.",
            "human_gen_text": [
                "ay has also fuelled more willingness to make sacrifices for causes. People expect more from their governments today, whether it is in terms of social welfare policies or environmental protection policies. In order to push their governments to meet these expectations, people are more willing to sacrifice their time and resources to make their voices heard. For example, the recent global environmental movement, Extinction Rebellion, has gained momentum in advocating for more aggressive action against climate change. The movement is known for their civil disobedience tactics, including blocking roads and causing disruption to highlight the urgency of the climate crisis. Many individuals who support this movement are willing to sacrifice their own convenience and risk arrest to call for more significant action from their governments in tackling climate change. The movement has been successful in drawing attention to their cause, and many major cities around the world have declared climate emergencies in response to their demands. Overall, the expectation for more action from governments has motivated many individuals to make sacrifices for their causes.\nLastly, people are also more willing to make sacrifices today due to a sense of unfairness and unavailability of merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. People may feel that they are entitled to certain benefits or resources, and if these are not available to them, they may be more willing to make sacrifices to obtain them. For instance, in the case of healthcare, some individuals may feel that they are entitled to comprehensive healthcare coverage, and if this is not available in their own country, they may be willing to travel to other countries for treatment. In order to do so, they may have to make financial sacrifices or endure long waiting times, but they do so because they feel that they are entitled to these benefits. Similarly, some individuals may be willing to make sacrifices in order to obtain education opportunities that are not available in their own countries. For example, students who are unable to obtain scholarships within their own country may be willing to study abroad and make sacrifices such as leaving their homes and families to do so.\nIn conclusion, while there may be individuals who make sacrifices for their causes in order to gain fame and fortune, I believe that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations from governments, and a sense of entitlement to certain benefits or resources. This is a positive development, as it shows that individuals are willing to take action to create change and make a difference in society.",
                "ay may have also contributed to the increased willingness of people to make sacrifices for their causes. In the past, people may not have had as many avenues to voice their concerns and make changes as they do now. With the advent of social media and more democratic societies, people have greater access to express their opinions and make demands. As a result, people are more willing to stand up for their causes by making sacrifices because they know that they have more power to make a change today. This is evident in the youth-led climate strikes that have been happening globally. Young people have been sacrificing their time and education to attend these strikes, demanding that their governments take more drastic action to tackle climate change. They are showing a willingness to make sacrifices for their cause because they feel that their future is at risk, and they want their governments to take concrete action to mitigate the effects of climate change.\nLastly, people may also be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. For instance, healthcare is considered a basic need for one's survival. However, some people may not have access to healthcare or may have to pay exorbitant fees for it. This feeling of injustice may drive people to make sacrifices, such as crowdfunding for someone's medical bills or volunteering at a healthcare organisation, to ensure that everyone has access to quality healthcare. The same can be said for meritorious students who do not receive the same opportunities as others due to their socioeconomic status. Many people are willing to make sacrifices to advocate for a fairer education system that provides equal opportunities for all students.\nIn conclusion, while there may be people who make sacrifices for their causes with selfish intentions, it is clear that there is also a growing number of people who are willing to make sacrifices for their causes. Celebrities are using their fame to make a difference, people have higher expectations of their governments, and feelings of injustice are driving people to make sacrifices for causes they believe in. Ultimately, it is up to the individual to decide if they want to make sacrifices for their cause and how they want to go about doing so.",
                "ay also lead to greater willingness to make sacrifices for causes. Individuals are increasingly holding governments accountable for meeting societal needs such as public healthcare, affordable housing and education. This is especially seen in countries such as the United States, where the coronavirus pandemic has exposed the government's failure to provide adequate healthcare and support for its citizens. In response, healthcare workers have risked their lives to care for the sick, while citizens have made donations and volunteered their time and resources to support those in need. The Black Lives Matter campaign is another example of how citizens have taken matters into their own hands, by protesting and actively pushing for police reform. This shows how people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes, as they refuse to sit back and wait for governments to act.\nLastly, there is also the feeling of unfairness when individuals are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. For instance, in the recent haze crisis in Southeast Asia caused by forest fires in Indonesia, affected countries such as Singapore and Malaysia expressed anger at Indonesia's perceived lack of effort to mitigate the crisis. There were also discussions about the possibility of seeking compensation from Indonesia. This illustrates how individuals are more willing to take action and make sacrifices for their causes when they feel a sense of injustice.\nIn conclusion, it can be seen that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today. While there may be individuals who exploit causes for personal gain, celebrities are tapping on their popularity to champion their causes and individuals are increasingly holding governments accountable for societal needs. The feeling of unfairness when individuals are not entitled to merit goods or benefits is also a motivating factor for individuals to make sacrifices for their causes.",
                "ay have led to a greater willingness to make sacrifices for causes. In today's world, people have a heightened awareness of the social and environmental issues that plague the world. Citizens of developed countries expect their governments to take action to address these issues. In fact, some may even view it as a government's responsibility to effect change in society. Therefore, when citizens perceive their governments to be lax in addressing these issues, they may be more inclined to take matters into their own hands and make sacrifices to champion their causes. The Climate Strike movement, which began in 2018 with Greta Thunberg, an environmental activist from Sweden, saw millions of people around the world join her in striking and walking out of schools and workplaces to demand immediate political action to combat climate change. The movement was a bold statement of the power of citizens in collective action to bring about change and highlights how people today are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes in demanding their governments to take actions.\nLastly, the feeling of unfairness or lack of entitlement to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries motivates people to make sacrifices for their causes. The European migrant crisis serves as an example of how feelings of indignation at being denied merit goods could drive people to make sacrifices for their causes. Countries in Europe had been called upon to host refugees fleeing Syria and other war-torn countries. Although many European countries were willing to contribute, some others were not as accommodating, fearing that refugees would pose a security threat or burden on their economy. In retaliation, activists in Britain, France, Germany and Sweden have organised various demonstrations, gruelling charity runs, and other events that raise awareness of the conditions of the refugees that had been denied entry into their countries. Many of these people are aware that they are taking risks and making sacrifices to support these refugees, but they feel that this is the least they can do for fellow human beings and that their actions would inspire their governments to change their attitudes towards the refugees.\n\nIn conclusion, there are instances where people are willing to make \"sacrifices\" for ulterior motives such as fame and fortune. However, many people today are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes. This is evident in the way celebrities are tapping on their popularity to propagate their causes, the higher expectations people have in their governments today, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries.",
                "ay have also propelled people to become more willing to make sacrifices for their causes. When governments do not meet the expectations of the people, citizens may feel that they have to take matters into their own hands, choosing to make sacrifices in order to affect change themselves. A good example of this can be seen in the case of climate change. Many governments around the world have been criticised for their lack of action and urgency in addressing the issue of climate change. This has led to a growing number of individuals, particularly the younger generations, taking it upon themselves to make sacrifices in order to fight climate change. For instance, young people have been protesting, organising strikes, and even going on hunger strikes to raise awareness about the urgency of the issue. They have also been changing their personal habits such as reducing meat consumption and using eco-friendly products to reduce their carbon footprint. These actions not only demonstrate their willingness to make sacrifices for their cause, but also show how they are taking responsibility for ensuring a better future for themselves and future generations.\nLastly, people may also be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to the widespread feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. When people see that other countries are providing their citizens with certain benefits or merit goods, they may feel that they too should be entitled to these benefits, and may be willing to make sacrifices in order to attain them. For example, people who live in countries with poor healthcare systems may be willing to make sacrifices to campaign for universal healthcare, after seeing how other countries with universal healthcare systems are benefiting from them. This is evident in countries like the United States of America, where the lack of universal healthcare has led to widespread protests, with many citizens highlighting the negative impacts of not having access to affordable healthcare. Thus, this serves as an indication that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to their desire for fairness and equal opportunities.\nIn conclusion, while there may be instances where some people make \"sacrifices\" for their causes merely for selfish gains, it is evident that there are more people who are willing to make sacrifices today due to the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations of the ruling governments, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. It is the hope that this trend of people being willing to make sacrifices for their causes continues, so as to bring about meaningful change for society.",
                "ay also contributes to the increased willingness of people to make sacrifices for their causes. In the past, people may have believed that they were powerless against their governments, or that it was pointless to speak up. However, in today's age of information and technology, people are more aware of their rights and are able to speak up more easily against injustices. This is partly due to the ease of access to information through the internet and social media platforms. As such, people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes, as they believe that their voices can be heard and their sacrifices can make a difference in effecting change. Furthermore, this increased awareness of rights and expectations has led to an increase in protests and activism, which is a clear demonstration of people's willingness to make sacrifices for their causes.\nLastly, feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries can also account for the increased willingness of people to make sacrifices for their causes today. With the rise of globalization, people are more aware of what other countries have that they do not, and may feel that they are missing out on the benefits of living in a developed country. For instance, in countries where healthcare is not freely available to the public, people may feel that they have to make sacrifices in order to access medical treatment, or may band together to push for the government to provide free healthcare. Similarly, in countries where access to education is limited, people may feel that they have to make sacrifices in order to afford education, or may take to the streets to protest for free education. As such, people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes, as they believe that they are entitled to the same benefits and opportunities as people in other countries.\nIn conclusion, while there may be people who make sacrifices for their causes in order to gain fame and fortune, I believe that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today. This is due to the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments today, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries.",
                "ay could also be a reason why people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes. Governments are expected to provide good governance, education, healthcare, and other basic needs to their citizens. However, if a government fails to provide its citizens with access to these basic needs, it could lead to feelings of unfairness and discontent among the people. For example, in India, the government's policies on mining are causing severe environmental degradation and endangering the lives of indigenous peoples. In response, many Indian activists have gone on hunger strikes, risking their own lives, to bring attention to the government's inaction on the issue. This shows their willingness to make sacrifices for their cause, as the hunger strikes could lead to permanent damage to their health. Therefore, the failure of governments to provide good governance, coupled with high expectations from their citizens, may lead to individuals making sacrifices for their causes.\nIn conclusion, it is arguable that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today. This is due to the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments today and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. However, it is important to note that not all sacrifices are genuine, and there may be ulterior motives behind some acts of sacrifice. Nonetheless, genuine acts of sacrifice for one's cause should be celebrated and encouraged, as they are a testament to an individual's dedication and belief in their cause.",
                "ay also contribute to the willingness of people to make sacrifices for their causes. Citizens expect their governments to be more responsive to their needs and to promote social justice. This can be seen in recent times where there has been an outpouring of frustration and anger against some countries' responses to coronavirus outbreaks, and how they have been managing their economies and societies as a result of the outbreak. Citizens are also more demanding for political reforms, such as more transparency in political governance, and an end to corruption. This increase in expectations also means that people are now willing to make greater sacrifices to achieve these changes. The recent Hong Kong protest movement is a good example. Millions of Hong Kong residents took to the streets to protest against the proposed extradition bill, which would allow Hong Kong citizens to be sent to China for trial. It was an incredible act of courage and determination by the Hong Kong residents, who were willing to risk arrest and imprisonment for their cause. These sacrifices illustrate how people are willing to make sacrifices to achieve social justice, even as their expectations of their governments rise.\nLastly, feelings of unfairness can also contribute to why people are willing to make sacrifices for their causes. In this day and age, information is easily accessible, and people are more aware of the privileges that residents of other countries get to enjoy \u2013 such as universal healthcare, free education and paid parental leave. Citizens feeling envious or shortchanged by their own country's system may therefore feel impelled to push for change and may be willing to make sacrifices for it. An example would be America finally adopting a universal healthcare system. America has one of the highest costs of healthcare, yet millions of Americans lack access to health insurance. The pandemic has necessitated a greater urgency for America to adopt a universal healthcare system and to improve its healthcare facilities in general. Many Americans, such as retirees and lower-income families, would be required to sacrifice a part of their entire life savings to get healthcare. America's lack of universal healthcare just amplifies the significance of America's social inequalities, and even Americans who had previously been opposed to universal healthcare are now willing to support and make sacrifices for change in light of the pandemic. Therefore, this example illustrates how people are willing to make sacrifices for their causes if it means fighting for fairness and equality in their society.\n\nTo sum up, while some people may make sacrifices for their causes to gain personal fame and fortune, there are definitely people who are more willing to make sacrifices today for altruistic purposes. This is possibly due to the increasing influence of celebrity culture, higher expectations of their governments, and feelings of inequity in their communities. As we move forward, it is important to acknowledge those who are willing to make sacrifices and work towards promoting more empathetic and altruistic behavior.",
                "ay have also contributed to the willingness of people to make sacrifices for their causes. With the advent of the internet and social media, it has become easier for people to connect with each other on issues that they care about, whether it be climate change, human rights or income inequality. People are demanding more transparency and accountability from their governments, and are willing to take to the streets or to organize peaceful protests to make their voices heard. An example of this would be the Hong Kong pro-democracy protests, where citizens took to the streets in large numbers to call for greater autonomy from China. Despite facing harsh police brutality and crackdowns, the protesters persisted in their cause, revealing their willingness to put themselves at risk for something they strongly believed in. This not only illustrates people\u2019s willingness to make sacrifices, but their commitment towards seeking change even in times of adversity.\nLastly, feelings of unfairness and the lack of entitlement to merit goods could motivate people to make sacrifices for their causes today. Globalization has made the world more interconnected than ever before, and as a result, people are more aware of the inequalities and disparities in the world. They may feel that they are not entitled to the same benefits or opportunities as people in other countries due to factors such as their nationality, race or socio-economic status. This may inspire them to work towards promoting change by taking action and making sacrifices for their causes. For example, activists working towards climate change may make the decision to adopt a vegetarian or vegan lifestyle, reducing their carbon footprint and making a sacrifice for something they believe in. Similarly, educated individuals may decide to forego high-paying jobs in favor of working for non-profit organizations or charities, using their skills and knowledge to make a difference in society instead of simply pursuing profit for themselves.\nIn conclusion, there are forces that may inspire individuals to make sacrifices for their causes. While some may use these causes as a means to gain fame and fortune, there are those who are genuinely committed to driving change and promoting progress. With social media and other platforms allowing them to leverage their popularity and seek support from others, as well as heightened social awareness and unfairness, it is clear that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today.",

As society progresses, people are looking towards their governments to take care of their needs and promote social justice. James Madison once said, \"Public virtue cannot exist in a nation that is permanently on the brink of starvation.\", highlighting the relationship between the government's actions and the well-being of the people. However, when governments fail to provide for their citizens, people start to take matters into their own hands. In countries with high levels of corruption and ineffective governance, citizens often take to the streets to fight for their rights and causes. An instance to illustrate this would be the Arab Spring which began in 2010, in which a series of anti-government protests, uprisings, and armed rebellions spread throughout the Middle East and North Africa. Citizens fought back against regimes that they believed did not represent their interests. During these protests, many citizens were willing to make sacrifices, risking their lives to vocalize their discontent. Therefore, it is possible to argue that when citizens believe that their governments are not doing enough, they are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes to bring about change.\nLastly, people may be more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today due to feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries. In today's highly globalized world, people can see the benefits that other countries provide for their citizens. This becomes a problem when their own governments are unable or unwilling to provide similar benefits. For instance, in countries with inadequate or limited healthcare resources, citizens may feel that they are being denied access to basic healthcare that is provided by other countries. This can result in people feeling that they need to fight harder for their right to healthcare. In such cases, people are willing to make sacrifices for their causes, even if it means putting their health and safety at risk. \nIn conclusion, it is a complicated and nuanced question to ask if people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today. While there are some who may make \"sacrifices\" for personal gains, there are also others who are genuinely willing to put themselves on the line for their causes. However, the significance of celebrity culture and social media today, higher expectations that people have in their governments, and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries may indicate that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today."

These are usually dependent on what one considers \"normal\" relative to one'sown background and understanding of the world around him or her. One'scharacter and upbringing also plays a huge role in determining how one views the differences in languages around him. As such, differences in the way people look, act and talk all contribute towards how we discriminate against people. In more extreme cases, the Rohingya crisis is a sad example of how people are discriminated against purely because of their language and background. In August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar'sarmy on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border into Bangladesh. The United Nations has described this as a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\" and ordered the Buddhist-majority country to take measures to protect members of its Rohingya community from genocide. At least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the month after the violence broke out, and as of today, more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled the country and tens of thousands have been killed. From this example, we can clearly see how despite the similarities people may share, such as living in the same country and even similarities in their languages, other differences such as ethnicity can result in massive conflicts which bring about much pain and suffering. This illustrates how speaking the same language does not necessarily leave the world better off as hoped for.\nYet, it cannot be denied that there are advantages to everyone speaking the same language. Having a common language would eliminate the communication barriers that exist between people. Despite the fact that there are many races and ethnicities of people living within Singapore, with each having their own unique language, English remains a common language that unites everyone. This enables the population, especially those born in later generations, to communicate and interact with one another with ease. This has resulted in numerous benefits for society as people are able to come together to make positive changes. Research programmes in tertiary institutes have had teams make breakthrough discoveries in areas such as stem cell research and bioengineering. This would have been much more challenging to accomplish if language barriers existed between members of the teams. This shows the important role that a common language can play as a fundamental tool for effective communication and how it could make the world better off.\nAll in all, I believe that a common language does not necessarily lead to the world being a better place if the collective aim of everyone is not to benefit humanity. It has been asked, \"If we were blind and had no choice, would we still hate each other by the tone of our voice?\" This aptly describes how, in spite of a common language, discrimination and prejudice will exist in society unless we make a conscious effort to accept people for who they are. Language can help to make us more accepting, but how we chose to wield it is another matter.",

Being able to communicate with an individual from another country directly without a language barrier would mean that everyone speaks, understand and relates the same way. This would lead to fewer misunderstandings and disputes, resulting in less tension between countries and their people.\n\nOn the other hand, there are several disadvantages that come with having a universal language. First and foremost, language is an essential part of culture, and having one universal language would mean losing the language diversity that makes up our cultural identities. It would also risk losing the richness that comes with different languages, which encompass the diversity of meanings, grammar, literature, and culture.\n\nSecondly, it would lead to the eradication of dying languages, which would ultimately lead to a loss of language and historical knowledge. The linguistic diversity that exists in the world today is a source of pride, worth preserving to maintain the unique identity that each people bring.\n\nThirdly, establishing a universal language could result in the imposition of a language that would not suit everyone. This may mean that some cultures and people may feel marginalized, and their voices unheard. Thus, the language barrier would be replaced by a dominance of a single language over the rest of the languages spoken across the world.\n\nIn conclusion, the world is currently facing challenges caused by language barriers that have led to misunderstandings, miscommunication, and conflicts among nations. A universal language would be a significant step towards a global community, eliminating language barriers and facilitating better communication, economic prosperity and less tension among people from different countries.

In this way, we can break down barriers and build bridges across different cultures, leading to a more inclusive and well-connected world.\nIn conclusion, while having a common language may seem like an ideal solution to promote communication and unity, the reality is that language plays an important role in shaping our individual and collective identities. Diversity in languages promotes creativity, understanding and tolerance of differences between people.

Hatred and discrimination arise from human nature alone, and not from any inherent feature of languages themselves.\nTo conclude, the world would not be better off if everyone spoke the same language.

Every language tells a unique story about a culture and preserving these languages allows us to learn more about the customs and beliefs of other people.

Those who do not speak the language may be thought of as ignorant or uneducated, which could lead to discrimination and prejudice towards them. Furthermore, if everyone spoke the same language, it may not necessarily mean that misunderstandings and miscommunications will cease to exist. Even within the same language, there are often cultural differences and nuances which may lead to misinterpretations.

This erodes cultural heritage and identity, making it harder for people to pass down their traditions and customs to the next generation.\nIn conclusion, the world would not be better off if everyone spoke the same language. While a common language would reduce language barriers, it would lead to a loss of diversity and individuality, depriving society of its unique colors and creative potential.

People who do not speak English well may have difficulty accessing information and opportunities, leading to greater inequality.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may seem advantageous at first glance to have a single language spoken by everyone, it is important to recognize the value and importance of linguistic diversity and the unique perspectives it brings.

Language diversity allows us to maintain varied cultures, traditions, and values, which enriches society. It also promotes empathy and acceptance of people from different backgrounds, allowing us to learn from and adopt new ideas and practices.

Tourists are often attracted to countries with a diverse cultural heritage. A common language could erode this aspect of the tourism industry and could potentially lead to economic loss. Additionally, countries that have multiple languages spoken often have advantages in communication and negotiations with foreign countries. Knowing and speaking different languages may make it easier in understanding the cultures and mindsets of other countries, thus facilitating trade and diplomatic relations.\n\nIn conclusion, although there are arguments for a common language, preserving the diversity of languages in society has more benefits. Cultures and customs that are tied to a specific language should be valued and appreciated.

This could result in resentment, and even resistance from people who feel their identities are being eroded. \nMoreover, imposing a common language upon people around the globe could be logistically impossible. With more than 7,000 languages spoken in the world, it would be exhausting and time-consuming to try and get everyone to learn a single language. Language is an integral part of an individual's identity and it would be unfair and unrealistic to expect people to abandon their language and culture for the sake of conformity.\nIn conclusion, while having a common language may seem attractive, it is unlikely to achieve a more equitable and inclusive world.

Language and culture help foster unique identities and help us to understand and appreciate the differences between one another.

The promotion of a universal language would, therefore, mean the loss of the uniqueness of language and diversity in self-expression.\n\nFurthermore, the adoption of a universal language would require significant resources and effort in terms of education and training, as the world would need to start from scratch to learn this new language. It could also lead to language privilege, where those who do not speak the universal language may be left behind in terms of education, opportunities, and socio-economic status.\n\nIn conclusion, while a universal language could lead to a more connected and efficient world, it would also mean a loss of diverse cultures and self-expression. Although it may seem like a tempting solution to solve communication-related problems, a more realistic approach might be to develop language education programs that aim to teach and preserve different languages, while also promoting a mindset of cultural diversity and unity.",

            "human_gen_truncate": "ing and video calls have shaped the habits and tendencies of today'syouths and adults, as people become accustomed to the fact that their friends and loved ones are merely a text message or a phone call away, and they often find themselves spending more time with others via electronic devices as opposed to having face-to-face conversation. As Whatsapp and other forms of messaging continue to thrive, many resign to conversing over text rather than making the effort to meet up in person over dinner, or a cup of coffee. Such habits have irrevocably affected our relationships with others and are reflected in the behaviours of our children. It is not uncommon to see quiet, desolate playgrounds in Singapore nowadays, for many children prefer to retire to the comfort of playing with an iPad in an air-conditioned room indoors. Even on public transport, the ever-familiar sight of commuters with earphones plugged in and staring at a glaring smartphone screen never fails to greet passengers daily. Evidently, the fast pace of life has compromised on flourishing social relationships and promoted a society of hermits instead.\nFurthermore, the negative impacts that a fast pace of life has on our mental and physical health are far from negligible. Owing largely to the increased usage of devices and time spent looking at monitors, Singapore sees an outrageously high rate of myopia; we hold the unfortunate title of being world number 1 for the prevalence of myopia in seven to nine-year-olds. Additionally, the rise in the number of fast-food outlets in Singapore such as the popular McDonald'sor Burger King is indubitably a result of Singaporean'sgreater desire for a quick and efficient meal as they hurry to get back to work. These days, many see meals simply as a necessary chore to replenish their energy, rather than something that should be leisurely enjoyed. Such an unhealthy diet contributes to the 1.7 million people in Singapore at risk of obesity-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, and especially in explaining the dramatic rise in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes in recent years. Hence, it is evident that a fast pace of life has worsened the physical health of Singaporeans in more than one aspect. Moreover, the intense work culture is a key factor in explaining the reduced time spent on recreation or leisure activities, causing high-stress levels. People hardly give themselves sufficient time to rest and relax, trying their best to meet exorbitant workloads. According to the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore has seen large increases in cases of depression and anxiety in youths and young adults. Therefore, the decline in health levels of Singaporeans stands as strong evidence for the stand that the pace of life is indeed too fast in Singapore.\nTo end, although I acknowledge that their benefits reaped from economic progress is significant and desirable to all, the ramifications with which a fast pace of life brings to Singaporeans are severe and deep-rooted in their impact. Since Singapore is currently enjoying stable economic growth and progress, I propose that the government take more measures to ensure that the pace of life in Singapore is not too fast in order to prevent trends of declining, increasing stress levels, and ungraciousness are stemmed in the long run. Having said that, one must seek to achieve a balance between tangible and intangible comforts \u2013 in order to achieve, individuals should also seek to review their priorities and adjust their respective pace of life accordingly so as to ensure that it is not too fast and to the detriment of our overall well-being.",

This not only affects productivity in the workforce but also has a significant impact on the individual's mental and emotional well-being.\n\nMoreover, the fast pace of life in Singapore has also led to a decline in the quality of social relationships. As Singaporeans prioritize work and professional success, they tend to neglect their family, friends, and personal relationships. Many individuals find themselves making appointments with friends weeks in advance or struggling to find time to meet their loved ones. This has led to a growing concern about the social well-being and mental health of Singaporeans.\n\nAdditionally, the fast pace of life in Singapore has led to a rise in consumerism. Singaporeans are consistently bombarded with advertisements and promotions, encouraging them to purchase more and consume excessively. In a fast-paced society, material possessions have become a symbol of success and social status, leading to an unhealthy obsession with materialism and consumerism. This culture of consumerism has led to the depletion of natural resources and an increase in waste production.\n\nIn conclusion, the pace of life in Singapore is too fast for its own good. While the fast pace of life brings about many advantages such as efficiency, productivity, and convenience, it also results in negative consequences such as increased stress levels, a decline in quality social relationships, and a rise in consumerism. Thus, it is essential for the government and individuals to take a step back and reevaluate their priorities and values, to strike a balance between work and personal life, and to promote sustainable living and well-being. Only then can Singapore continue to develop as a prosperous and sustainable city-state, while providing a high quality of life for its citizens.",

                "ing, email, and social media, have brought about the prevalence of a 24/7 connected society that never truly disconnects. Hence, individuals have become increasingly less engaged in the face-to-face social interactions that foster meaningful relationships with one another. Such phenomena have resulted in a society that is becoming increasingly individualistic and where social responsibility and graciousness are suffering. Moreover, the detrimental effects of high stress levels and long working hours on the physical and mental health of Singaporeans are becoming more apparent, as illustrated by the alarming rise of chronic diseases and mental health issues such as depression. This is unsurprising given the fact that Singaporeans work some of the longest hours in the world, juggling their daily work and family commitments in an endless cycle of toil. This rapid pace of life thus has wider implications for the society as a whole- it is increasingly becoming fraught with isolation and disease.\nGiven that Singapore is reputed for balancing economic progress with social harmony, it is now imperative that we shift our focus to quality of life as well, and re-examine our exceptional emphasis on efficiency and productivity. A slow pace of life would admittedly threaten our competitiveness, but what we lose in pure output, we could gain in greater work-life balance, reduced stress and fostering stronger social connections. Many countries have successfully achieved both economic development and social welfare without excessively fast-paced lifestyles, and so it is possible for Singapore to strike a similar balance that could result in a stronger, better landscape for all.\nTherefore, whilst economic growth is undoubtedly necessary for Singapore's survival in this competitive globalized world, the pace of life in Singapore has become too fast for its own good. As a society, we must recognize that Singapore is more than just a fast-paced city of efficiency. We must take time to slow down and build a kinder, more compassionate, and more gracious society, one that balances the demands of productivity with quality of life. It is time to shift our focus from economic dominance to the well-being of the country's people.",
                "ing services, ubiquitous social media platforms and round-the-clock online content consumption have brought about the proliferation of a culture in which people are constantly connected. This can be seen in the cementing of a 24/7 economy, with stores and other service provisions scarcely shutting. The culture of \"always-on\" work has carved out a space in the psyche of Singaporeans, causing work to encroach into almost every facet of our lives, with employees not hesitating to bring their tasks home or work well into the night. Coupled with the nation's high cost of living, which propels fear of job loss and job insecurity, 'busy' has become a ubiquitous badge of honor, where people take pride in their packed schedules. Overworked, multitasking Singaporeans barely have time for themselves or to foster meaningful relationships. It is not unheard of for Singapore's teachers to work weekends before returning to school to plan lessons for the next week, putting their work ahead of their personal life. To deal with the accelerating pace of life, the number of Singaporeans seeking psychological help has increased dramatically over the years, with burnout and depression among the ailments diagnosed.\nIn conclusion, while it is important for Singapore to keep up with the times economically and remain competitive globally, it should not come at the expense of its people's well-being. The government should continue to explore means for sustainable growth, including measures to reduce the cultural obsession with efficiency. The society should also recalibrate its value system, such that increased productivity, income and material living standards are no longer put above the importance of work-life balance, graciousness and mental health. Revising work schedules to include more rest periods, enforcing regulations that require stores to close earlier, or imbuing graciousness into the population through intentional efforts at the institutional levels or through 'kindness movement' campaigns that raise public awareness, should be some of the measures adopted by Singaporeans to recalibrate the pace of life -- ensuring that it serves us instead of swamping us.",
                "ing and social media, while initially meant to connect people, have ironically driven people apart from one another. This is seen when people prefer to communicate through their phones rather than face-to-face interactions, sacrificing personal connections and friendships for mere convenience. In addition, the fast pace of life in Singapore has also led to a decline in graciousness and consideration that Singaporeans once held. This was clearly shown in the heated reactions of the public to incidents such as the dispute over reserved seating on public transport. This is a result of the relentless pursuit of monetary gains and efficiency, causing people to overlook the importance of social relationships. Furthermore, the fast pace of life is also known to have negative impacts on the physical and mental health of Singaporeans. Long working hours coupled with the stress of deadlines and high expectations from employers have led to soaring rates of burnout and depression among Singaporean workers. The government has introduced policies such as the \"Work Right\" initiative to counteract this issue, but critics argue that more needs to be done to curb the fast pace of life in Singapore so that Singaporeans can lead healthier and happier lives.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be easy to argue that the fast pace of life in Singapore is necessary for its economic growth and competitiveness in the global market, we cannot ignore the significant negative impacts that it has on Singaporeans' social relationships and overall well-being. Therefore, it is imperative that Singaporeans work towards striking a balance between economic growth and quality of life, and adapt a more holistic view on what truly matters.",

However, this has resulted in social relationships being sacrificed due to the convenience of staying connected with one another through technology instead of face-to-face communication. Singaporeans have become increasingly detached from one another, plagued by the loneliness and isolation that come with work-life balance issues. The fast pace of life also leaves little time for leisure activities or simply spending time with loved ones, leading to a lack of meaningful connections between people. This has resulted in a decline in graciousness and mutual respect for one another, causing social harmony to suffer in Singapore. \nMoreover, the fast pace of life has taken a toll on Singaporeans' health, with increased stress levels being a common issue for most. A fast-paced lifestyle typically involves a jam-packed schedule, leaving little to no room for rest or relaxation. Long working hours and an intense work culture are prevalent, leading to burnout and heightened levels of stress. An unhealthy lifestyle which includes a lack of sleep, exercise and nutritious diets can lead to various health problems such as obesity, hypertension, and heart disease.\nIn conclusion, while the fast pace of life in Singapore has led to desirable economic outcomes, I firmly believe that it is detrimental to the health and social harmony of Singaporeans. The government should therefore take steps to strike a balance between economic development and the well-being of its people, through measures such as flexible working hours, work-life balance initiatives, and frequent public holidays to encourage leisure activities and rest.

While some argue that social media allows us to connect and network with others from around the world, it can paradoxically contribute to alienation and isolation from those around us in real life. Furthermore, a fast pace of life that prioritises productivity often leaves little time for meaningful social relationships, which are crucial in fostering a cohesive and harmonious community. Additionally, the stress of a fast-paced life can also lead to a host of health problems, both mental and physical. The prevalence of mental health issues such as anxiety and burnout have been on the rise in Singapore in recent years, further highlighting the need to re-evaluate the pace of Singaporean society.\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of economic growth is important, it should not be done at the expense of social relationships and individual well-being. The Singapore government should aim to strike a balance between productivity and maintaining a healthy pace of life by advocating for work-life balance, supporting mental health initiatives and promoting social connectedness.

With the ubiquity of smartphones and other forms of technology, people have become accustomed to getting things done almost immediately, often at the expense of face-to-face bonding. This has culminated in a society that is suited more to fast communication and superficial acquaintance than authentic companionship. Moreover, the pressure to keep up with the fast pace of life has led to many Singaporeans neglecting their health and well-being, as they strive to meet the demands of the world around them. Statistics have shown that Singaporeans are suffering from higher levels of stress than ever before, with many experiencing a variety of physical and mental health issues. Clearly, the pace of life in Singapore is too fast for its own good.\nIn conclusion, while the emphasis on efficiency has allowed Singapore to develop economically to a significant extent, the negative impacts of such a fast pace of life on Singaporeans' graciousness, health, and interpersonal relationships cannot be ignored. A concerted effort is needed to promote the importance of balance, to ensure that the welfare of individuals is not sacrificed in the pursuit of economic growth.

This leads to insufficient opportunities for people to form deeper, more meaningful connections with others, as people begin to prioritise their work and other obligations instead of family and friends. Additionally, elevated levels of stress and anxiety ensues from the constant pressure to be efficient and productive, as Singaporeans find themselves burnt out and emotionally drained. This can manifest in the form of heightened cases of mental health issues such as burnouts and depression, which are becoming increasingly common in Singapore.\nIn conclusion, while the benefits of efficiency and productivity that result from Singapore's fast pace of life are undeniable, it is imperative to take a step back and consider the detrimental impact it has on Singaporeans. Attempting to maintain our current progress is a double-edged sword, as it risks the erosion of our social fabric and the well-being of our people.

The convenience of modern, automated technology has made it easy to work long hours every day, leading to emotional burnout, decreasing job satisfaction, and diminishing family time for many Singaporeans. The fast pace of life in Singapore has resulted in a vicious cycle that often leaves Singaporeans stressed out, constantly working and feeling emotionally burnt out.\nMoreover, the need for efficient living has come at a cost to the nation's physical health. Singaporeans have to juggle multiple roles daily - work, family, and personal obligations - leading to the neglect of physical health and overall wellbeing. Many Singaporeans have given up on a healthy diet or regular exercise, choosing to rely on fast food and other unhealthy food choices at the expense of their physical health. The fast pace of life in Singapore has led to a work culture that does not value rest and downtime, which is essential in allowing individuals to recharge mentally and physically.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the current pace of life in Singapore is too fast for its own good. While it has enabled Singapore to achieve significant economic progress and maintain global relevance, it has come at the expense of the social wellbeing of Singaporeans.

This phenomenon is particularly noticeable amongst younger generations who have grown up with technology, and has led to a decline in graciousness in society. Additionally, the fast pace of life has also led to many Singaporeans neglecting their health, as people find it difficult to find time, or allocate sufficient attention to leading a healthy lifestyle, such as fitting in an exercise routine or consuming healthy meals. As a result, Singaporeans are increasingly struggling with health problems, ranging from physical ailments such as obesity to mental issues such as depression and anxiety, which in turn, may affect our productivity and economy.\nIn conclusion, while the pace of life in Singapore has undeniably brought about economic prosperity and global recognition, it is important to examine the full extent of its impacts on Singaporeans as a whole. Undoubtedly, there are costs that accompany such an unrelenting pace of life, especially in areas concerning graciousness, health and mental well-being.

Additionally, the increased pace of life has led to negative health impacts such as chronic stress, which can lead to various mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. Many studies have shown that chronic stress can be traced back to Singapore's fast-paced lifestyle, which involves working long hours and a high level of competition. Therefore, it is essential to establish a proper work-life balance that promotes mental and physical health, with less emphasis on competitiveness and productivity.\nIn conclusion, while there are arguments for maintaining the current pace of life in Singapore, it is essential to recognise that it has several negative ramifications on the graciousness, health and stress levels of Singaporeans. The government should prioritise establishing a proper work-life balance and encouraging social interactions to prevent the erosion of social relationships and mental wellbeing.

For many, if they receive awards, not only are they put in the spotlight, but the hard work they put in to achieve what they did is thoroughly recognised. When Michael Phelps achieved the award of having the most number of gold medals in the history of the Olympics, he became both a legend and an icon. He could immediately retire as a result, travel the world, and still make money to lead a comfortable life with his title of most prized Olympian. Similarly, Usain Bolt's100-metre record made him the target of the advertising teams of most successful sports brands and led to the creation of a line of sport shoes attached to his name. His signature \"lightning\" pose became a highly impersonated pose by athletes around the world and he continues to inspire many others with his talent and personality. Prizes and awards are thus useful in helping artists and athletes boost their outreach and their careers away from their sports and their main lines of work. They allow athletes to establish fan bases, providing them with the validation and recognition they need. Prize and award ceremonies are also commonly screened live with millions of viewers watching, allowing them to have a great impact on not only the celebrities and athletes but their audience as well.\nHowever, prizes and awards may also in turn create a materialistic society in which the prizes and awards are sought instead of the achievement and recognition that come from them. Individuals might as a result only be willing to contribute to society for something in return, and may even resort to underhanded means to achieve what they want, opening prize and award systems to abuse. According to a 2008 scientific record, published retractions in scientific journals have increased around 1,200% over the past decade, even though the number of published papers has gone up by only 44%. Around half of these retractions are suspected cases of misconduct. Furthermore, scientists may only focus on populist domains in which there are prizes to be won, instead of domains of research that might benefit minority communities greatly, or even hidden discoveries that may benefit society greatly. Similarly, sportsmen may lose sight of the true meaning of sportsmanship in the pursuit of these awards. Lance Armstrong, a former legend was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after being found guilty of using steroids to improve his performance during the races. Excessive competition and emphasis of prizes and awards might result in individuals disregarding things achievements that might not come with rewards, causing society to evolve into one that is only individualistic, and focused on material self-interests.\nAs Jake Colsen once said, \"The ones who win usually don\"t need a prize.\" Though prizes and awards are undoubtedly valued in our society, it is important more so for us to be able to see beyond these material accolades of our achievements. Our identities should be continuously shaped and defined not only by our material achievements but our values as well. That is, keeping our eyes beyond the prize, instead of merely on it.",

Similarly, awards for artists who create thought-provoking work help to bring attention to art that challenges our norms and beliefs.\n\nDespite the benefits of these awards and prizes, there are criticisms of them as well. One of the most common criticisms is that they can create unhealthy competition and foster an environment of individualism. In some cases, the desire to win an award or prize can become all-consuming, leading individuals to prioritize winning over their personal values and the well-being of others. This can be particularly true for students who may engage in unethical practices like cheating or cutting corners to win academic prizes.\n\nAnother criticism is that awards and prizes can be limited in their scope. For example, awards for academic excellence are often based on standardized tests that fail to measure holistic abilities such as creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving. Similarly, art competitions can often be judged based on subjective criteria rather than objective merit, leaving some artists feeling overlooked and undervalued.\n\nIn conclusion, awards and prizes serve a useful purpose as a way to recognize and reward outstanding achievements and contributions. They motivate individuals to strive for excellence, boost morale, and provide public acknowledgment. While there may be criticisms of awards and prizes, it is important to remember that they are not an end in themselves but rather a means of recognizing and promoting excellence in various fields. We should celebrate the individuals who win these awards while also acknowledging the importance of collaboration and community in achieving excellence.",

Winning an Oscar allows actors and filmmakers to gain publicity and be given more opportunities, such as getting offered lead roles or being entrusted with more creative control in future film projects. It also sets a standard for aspiring actors and filmmakers to look up to, motivating them to work hard to achieve such an honourable recognition. Similarly, in sports, awards such as the Ballon d'Or and the Olympic Gold Medal create a sense of accomplishment and pride, inspiring individuals to work hard in their athletic pursuits. Those who win awards and prizes are seen by many as role models in their field, whose hard work and dedication should be emulated.\n\nHowever, it is important to recognise that the overuse of awards and prizes may lead to a value system that places emphasis solely on winning and achieving. This could create a materialistic society in which only success and personal gain are valued. Prizes and awards offer a just recognition to those who strive and do exceptionally well, but they should not become the sole motivator for people to do their work. People should not be focused solely on winning and accolades, but on developing a passion for their work and doing what they love. As the saying goes, \u201cThe journey is more important than the destination.\u201d\n\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards serve a useful purpose in recognizing hard work and dedication towards excellence. They inspire individuals to strive for their best, encourage one to reach their full potential, and set a standard of excellence for others to follow. However, it is essential to keep in mind that overvaluing awards and prizes may lead to a materialistic society in which personal gain is the main priority, and the true value of excellence is lost.",
                "dedication to their craft. These recognitions help to establish an individual as a leader in their respective industry, which can create a sense of pride for the nation or group that they represent. Take for example national sportsmen in events such as the Olympics, who represent their respective countries. When a sportsman or woman wins an Olympic Gold medal for their nation, the whole country takes pride and celebrates their achievement. It is as if every citizen has achieved it, everyone is happy and motivated to perform at their best to make their country proud. The same applies to the movie and music industry, where individuals who have won Oscars, Grammys and other prestigious awards have been able to influence others that look up to them, and have inspired them to excel in their respective crafts. Overall, prizes and awards serve to recognise outstanding individuals and inspire others, inspiring them to achieve greatness and be the best that they can be.\nHowever, it's important to note that while it's good to have awards and prizes as a driving force, the goal of seeking these rewards should not be the only motivation one has for working hard. Overvaluing these materialistic gains could create a highly competitive and even stressful society, where individuals might be driven only by the desire to win to the extent they forget about the process of learning or the significance of teamwork and collaboration, both of which being important values instilled during our educational years. In such a society, people may end up feeling burnt out, as they work towards every achievement. It is vital that society continues to value effort, hard work and dedication, not just the finish line. As a result, schools and organisations have an essential role in ensuring that the journey to the top should matter as much as arriving at the destination, even more so for students who are still developing career paths and interest areas. Students need to know that prizes and awards are a bonus for their dedication and motivation in undertaking certain challenges, not the only target they should work towards.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards have significant value and purpose in society. They recognise exceptional performance, inspire individuals and groups to perform better, and create a certain level of prestige. However, in order for prizes and awards to continue serving their purpose, they must also be viewed in a broad perspective that emphasises the importance of effort, collaboration, and learning. Prizes and awards should not be the only target of our work and motivation, but should serve as an acknowledgement for our contributions and achievements.",

The awards inspire many to push themselves harder, ultimately, and become better in their respective fields. Additionally, prize-giving ceremonies captivate a larger audience, generating more publicity and awareness for the field \u2013 which promotes even more hard work \u2013 as well as provides a platform for the winners to share their thoughts and contributions in that field further. Case in point, in Singapore, the National Youth Awards are presented every year to recognize youths who have contributed significantly to their communities through their leadership and project initiatives. The award not only creates awareness of the contributions of these individuals, but also motivates other youths to take up initiatives of their own. \n\nHowever, there is a flipside to the prize culture. The overemphasis on awards and recognition might lead people to focus only on the prize, ignoring the crucial aspect of the effort and the process. Such an attitude can lead to negatives such as unhealthy competition, cheating, and a lack of team cooperation \u2013 just as we hear about bribery scandals and doping cases in sports. Besides that, those who do not receive awards are likely to feel less valued and overlooked, leading to negative psychological effects such as anxiety and low self-esteem. This might eventually result in a negative impact on society and education, such as demotivation to work hard and cohesiveness. Therefore, we must keep in mind that awards and prizes bring significant benefits to society but have their limitations and potential drawbacks. \n\nTo conclude, awards and prizes have their usefulness in enriching and motivating individuals and the society as a whole. These recognitions help further research and promote the culture of excellence. However, when the prizes become the end goal rather than the means, it defeats the purpose of creating a better and more innovative society. Ultimately, it is up to us to strike a balance to maximise the benefits of prizes and awards while also maintaining a healthy perspective on the values of hard work and team effort.",

Many individuals look up to famous athletes and actors, and their achievements which are celebrated via awards like the Oscars, Grammys, and the Olympics inspire and motivate many to pursue their dreams and work hard to achieve them. This glorification inspires many to work hard, and always strive for excellence. Similarly, awards offered by universities have proven to motivate enrolment and research at these institutions. The prestige of having won an award in research is an added motivator to many academics because of the credibility and reputation such accolades confer to them and their work.\nHowever, while awards and prizes have a positive effect on society, there is also the risk of creating a materialistic culture that pushes individuals to seek only monetary or physical rewards, and this could bring some negative effects. The main focus of an individual's passion and hard work should be in their field and the enjoyment gained while doing so. The mad rush to obtain awards and prizes could cause individuals to overlook other positive aspects of their fields such as personal growth, social interactions, and the strengthening of relationships between groups and individuals all working together in the quest for the greater good. Furthermore, the mass focus on medals and grand accolades rather than the essence of the work itself could turn to superficiality eventually devaluing the importance of the work done, and its contribution to society could come under much scrutiny.\nIn conclusion, while there are moments in which the effect of awards and prizes may be questionable, I believe that they are an important tool that motivates, inspires and recognises individual successes. The impact of such rewards and accolades goes far beyond the monetary value they confer; they create inspiration, social connections and motivation leading to the broader social benefits. Ultimately, the key to the impact of prizes and awards lies not on the honours themselves, but the skill of those who organise them, and the quality of those who receive them.",

From Grammy Awards to Olympic medals, these acknowledgments highlight the best of the best, and paying homage to those who are remarkable and talented in their respective fields creates a gateway to inspire others to pursue the same goals.  Michael Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time, with 28 medals to his name, became an inspiration for a generation of swimmers, making uncommon feats look realistic and achievable to those with aspirations for the same level of success. Furthermore, teamwork and group projects could be rewarded, which encourages teamwork and collaboration, leading to superior results and outcomes. This could be seen in the Formula One Centre of Excellence in Oxfordshire, where over 280 engineers have combined efforts to collectively win more than 1000 races, including 12 driver and ten constructors' world championships. This collective recognition validates their tireless work and ultimately promotes the entire team's morale, creating an atmosphere of growth.\nHowever, we need to balance the benefits of rewards and acknowledge that excessive emphasis on prizes might result in a society focused solely on them. As a result, personal growth and intrinsic motivation to become better might be disregarded, and the path to reach the prize is at times lost. In Singapore, a society where the competition is steep, students could perceive certain prizes and awards as a necessity and not a supplement to their journey, causing many students to neglect their life skills and character development. This creates a preference for only pursuing activities that provide rewards instead of activities that add value to society, resulting in a society that becomes obsessed with the materialistic and loses sight of what truly matters.\nTo conclude, prizes and awards have several advantages, which extend beyond financial incentives. When appropriately-administered, they inspire, motivate, and validate people's hard work, and at times push them to exceed their limits and achieve great things. Nonetheless, we must be cautious of not over-emphasising awards and prizes, which might result in a society that is solely driven by materialism.",

These awards play a pivotal role in the promotion of creative expression, and they inspire many aspiring artists to pursue their passions and dreams. Watching favourite performers win awards, young individuals nurture a self-belief that they, too, can attain such heights of excellence with their own hard work, talent and persistence. The same is true for sports personalities who are awarded the highest sporting honours in the form of a gold medal, world cup trophy, or Olympic championship. Awards and prizes are an acknowledgement of an outstanding individual's efforts, and they serve as a motivator for others to follow similar paths of excellence.\nIn conclusion, I believe that awards and prizes serve a very useful purpose in recognising and rewarding people for their achievements. They inspire and motivate people to strive for excellence, and provide a sense of accomplishment to those who work hard. However, we must keep in mind that an overemphasis on awards may lead to a materialistic society that focuses only on individual success and personal gain. A balanced approach, where achievements are acknowledged and celebrated in a healthy manner, is necessary for awards and prizes to be truly effective in motivating excellence.",
                "determination to continue pursuing their crafts. For instance, the Academy Awards or Oscars, one of the world's most distinguished film award ceremonies, recognise the best film performances of the year. Winning this prestigious award is a dream come true for actors, directors, and producers, as their work is recognised on a global scale, and it provides them with career-changing opportunities such as better pay, more significant roles and boosts their publicity. Some people even say that the Oscars are like a barometer of what great films should be, inspiring filmmakers and actors to aim for even loftier heights. Just as in sports, athletes are constantly motivated to work hard and qualify for championships, cup finals, and other competition finals, where they can compete and demonstrate their athletic prowess and skill in order to achieve glory, prestige, and recognition.\nHowever, the excessive emphasis and overvaluation of awards sometimes cause an entire shift in the reasons for why someone strives to perform a task. In such cases, competitions can become all about winning the accolade rather than enjoying the process or the actual work and therein lies the problem of 'too much of a good thing'. When the quest for recognition and awards becomes the sole purpose of an individual or group, they could risk overlooking the joy of the process, the beauty and all the invaluable lessons learned along the way. In the field of education, instead of the process of learning being enjoyable and life-changing, a two-dimensional educational society governed by strategies that serve only to achieve good scores in national exams and other academic contests emerge, encouraging less creativity in the students, and making the art of learning less meaningful and enjoyable. As a result, the potential for the exploration of fresh, groundbreaking ideas is stifled, and society loses the untapped potential of these ideas that could serve the greater good.\nIn conclusion, despite the potential risks of overvaluing awards and prizes, one cannot ignore their usefulness in celebrating outstanding people's achievements and inspiring others to pursue their own dreams. Awards and prizes encourage the feeling that hard work is appreciated and is not in vain, and that we can make a difference in our communities. I believe that awards and prizes have a real and genuine impact on a society's motivations towards hard work and perseverance and provide lasting benefits that deserve recognition and celebration.",

For example, The Academy Awards \u2013 commonly known as the Oscars \u2013 is the most prestigious award in the film industry, and it inspires many people to try and make great films. The awards show brings people from all over the world together, and many aspiring filmmakers use it as a target to work towards. Similarly, the World Cup is the most prominent award in the sporting world, with teams and fans alike striving to win it every four years. The recognition that comes with winning such awards is incredibly motivating, and it is no coincidence that many of the greatest athletes and filmmakers the world has ever seen have won these prestigious awards.\n\nHowever, one downside of prizes and awards is that their over-emphasis can lead to a society that focuses too much on the attainment of rewards and prizes. The main objective of learning and research is often clouded by the lure of money and fame. In many cases, the objective of the research is solely to attain the prize, rather than to make a meaningful and lasting contribution to society. It is up to the individual to recognise that the fulfilment of success and happiness goes far beyond the attainment of prizes and awards.\n\nIn conclusion, awards and prizes serve a useful purpose in recognising and motivating individuals and groups that excel in various fields. They drive research and discoveries, create new opportunities, and inspire new heights to be achieved. However, it is important to remember that prizes and awards should not be the ultimate objective of one's journey.

The Academy Awards, or more popularly known as the Oscars, which recognises excellence in film by acknowledging the best films, actors, and behind-the-scenes workers, has inspired millions of people to aspire to work in these fields. It is this recognition through prizes and awards that made us remember Jack Nicholson in \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" or Meryl Streep in \"Sophie's Choice,\" and cemented their place as legends in the industry. Similarly, in sports, awards such as the Ballon d'Or, the Olympic medals, and the FIFA World Cup Trophy, are associated with extreme hard work and dedication, representing the highest levels of achievement and inspiring athletes to push their limits and become the best in the world. Just as we look up to sporting legends like Usain Bolt, Lionel Messi, and Michael Phelps, prizes and awards make sure we remember them, and inspire our youth to work hard and excel in these respective fields.\nHowever, the overvaluation of prizes and awards can have negative effects as well. In a society that places too much importance on the accumulation of prizes and awards, people may become motivated primarily by the desire for recognition rather than by a genuine passion for the work they do. It is when the goal becomes only recognition, the attempt at being seen by society as successful, that the true purpose of awards and prizes are defeated. This could lead to a materialistic society with a skewed sense of values, where we simply focus on achieving fame and money for something that might not even be wholesome or impactful.\nIn conclusion, while we recognise that there might be some negative impacts that could come from the overvaluation or materialisation of awards and prizes, the usefulness of prizes and awards in recognising excellence, incentivising progress, inspiring future generations, and motivating people to work hard towards their goals, cannot be denied. Awards and prizes are much more than just a piece of metal or paper, they are a celebration of the recognition of hard work and talents, something that we as individuals and society should always strive for.",

Winning an Oscar is considered the highest honour an actor can achieve, and as a result, it is coveted by many people. The Oscars,in turn, serve as a benchmark for producers and directors to measure the quality of the films they create, giving the film industry a guidepost to which to aspire. Similarly, the Olympic Games, or most sports-related competitions, award gold medals to the top athletes, instilling a sense of pride, honour, and a sense of achievement for both the participants and their respective countries. After all, it is the strong desire to win medals that pushes many athletes to train hard, sometimes even to the point of exhaustion, yet ultimately creating excellent moments of sweat, blood and tears for their respective countries. In summary, the recognition of talent through awards and prize is a remarkable way to give credit to those who excel in their areas of specialisation, that is, they serve a useful and inspirational purpose for motivation.\nHowever, it should also be recognised that an overemphasis on awards and prizes might create an unhealthy,materialistic culture, where an individual's worth is determined by the number of awards and crests attained. Whilst the value of appreciation and recognition is important, it should never replace or overshadow an individual's work ethic, ability, character, or their overall contribution to society. Ultimately, the attainment of awards and prizes should not be the sole metric of measuring one's contribution to society.\nIn conclusion, prizes and awards serve a useful purpose in recognising and rewarding the deserving, motivating both present and future participants to strive towards excellence, thus yielding a society that is continuously striving for betterment.

            "human_gen_truncate": "from 1955 until his assasination. He advanced civil rights through nonviolence, inspired by his Christian beliefs and nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. However, apart from his deep religious and moral beliefs, less appreciated and acknowledged is the courage of his convictions. King was nearly killed when he was stabbed by an assailant while on a book tour, and was arrested numerous times as he led marches and other demonstrations. He lived a great deal of his life in the face of ugly crowds, yet, King'sbeliefs and courage prevailed. It must be acknowledged that he was human, flawed and no doubt he was scared. However, his humanity never overcame his commitment to a higher purpose and in his own brave, nonviolent way, he showed courage. King'scourage gave others strength, and inspired many others to have the same goal of ending racial injustice. Therefore, this shows how moral courage can be expressed to end injustice, and is undoubtedly virtuous in fighting for positive change in society.\nHowever, we must also recognize that courage may not always be virtuous \u2013 it may bring about devastating consequences like the imposition on people'slives, destitution and military aggression. As seen in Adolf Hitler'sExpansionist Policy in WWII to set up his ideal world, he singlehandedly orchestrated the deaths of six million Jews during the Holocaust in the pursuit of his vision. His power was absolute and unchallenged, and showed courage and fierce determination in executing his plans. He was convicted in his desire for absolute power, even resorting to underhanded means for political ascension \u2013 he and his Gestapo (the German secret police) burnt down the Reichstag in order for Hitler to initiate a state of Emergency and seize both the power of the Chancellor and the President and install himself as the absolute dictator, the Fuhrer. It took courage for Hitler to pursue this dream for absolute dominion so relentlessly, especially in the face of such mounting global opposition and adversity. Despite the threat of military aggression against his country and the ultimate threat of a world war, he remained resolute. However, such a dream as he wished to be fulfilled was tainted and distorted, and as the saying goes, \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". In this instance, his courage was abused and brought unimaginable pain and suffering to vast numbers of people \u2013 such courage can never, in any sense, be considered virtuous.\nSimilarly, courage should not be regarded as a virtue when such courage is utilised to pursue what one thinks is the right course of action against general consensus and the greater good of all. Courage in this sense can be made manifest in one man'sassumed delusional struggle against the broader concerns of society, a self-initiated renegade cause that brings destruction and uncertainty in its wake. Such an example is of the parallels of both Doctor Stockmann from the play, \"Enemy of the People\", by Henrik Ibsen, and the true story of Erin Brockovich. In both cases, both Brockovich and Stockmann discovered discrepancies in the water supply that led them to deduce, with conviction, that the water sources were poisoned. Hence, they sought to challenge the authorities, albeit with insufficient evidence, compromising and jeopardising the livelihoods of many of whom had jobs dependent on the water supply and its management. Despite the evident repercussions their perception of the truth might have imposed on the innocents, they nevertheless went ahead with their quest for supposed justice, disregarding the injustice that they would exact on the people. Hence, in this sense, courage is seen as an instrument of a selfish quest for a personal belief, rather than an expression of a noble virtue.\nOscar Wilde quipped, \"Society does not exist, it is a mere concept. The real world consists of only individuals.\" This statement can be seen as true when we realize that there is no realistic standardisation and no coagulation of the separate individuals of society into one condensed body. Since courage is an instrument exacted and controlled by the individual, the perception of courage and the effects of courageous acts are bound to vary greatly as the individual lends a portion of his multi-dimensional character to the expression of courage. Hence there can be no clear-cut designation of courage as a pure virtue, as it does not exist in mono-dimensions. Courage can be positive, bestowing blessings upon others, and can be a virtue, or it can be a curse \u2013 depending on what objectives it lends itself to.",

Acting with courage does not necessarily absolve one of moral responsibility.\n\nCourage may also have different consequences for different people. For someone who is privileged and has a safety net, taking a risky action may be a smaller sacrifice than for someone who has more to lose. In this case, the idea of courage may be skewed and somewhat unachievable for those who do not have social or economic privilege. Courage may be considered a virtue for those who have access to support and resources to help them mitigate the risk of their actions.\n\nHowever, it is undeniable that there are situations where courage is necessary and even virtuous. For example, standing up for one's beliefs in the face of opposition or discrimination requires courage and can have a positive impact. People who use their courage to advocate for social issues like climate change or human rights often inspire others to take action as well. In situations where the stakes are high, courage can make a significant difference in one's ability to overcome adversity.\n\nIn conclusion, the concept of courage is not simple or straightforward. While it is often considered to be a virtue, it is not always necessary or virtuous to act with courage in every situation. Rather, it is important to consider the context, consequences, and ethics of one's actions in deciding whether to act bravely. Courage, although admirable, cannot exist without a moral and ethical framework to guide it.",

He was even willing to be imprisoned for his beliefs. Through his courageous acts, Dr. King changed the course of history, leaving behind a legacy that remains resonant till today as a powerful reminder of the possibilities that reside within each and every one of us, if only we choose to embrace courage.\nIn conclusion, courage is a multifaceted term that can be seen from different perspectives. While some would argue that courage is not always a virtue, I would maintain that courage can indeed be considered a virtue when exhibited in certain contexts. In the pursuit of individual identity, moral and physical courage can be seen as virtuous if used to initiate change while fostering tolerance and acceptance. Courage is a precious gift, and it is up to us to decide when to exercise it, and how to use it for the betterment of society.",

His dignified and courageous approach in the face of fierce opposition earned him the Nobel Peace Prize. Indeed, he had the courage to stand up for the rights of his people, and his legacy as a courageous and virtuous leader lives on today.\nHowever, we must acknowledge that courage in itself is not always a virtue. It can be exacted in the form of folly or suppression, and can lead to negative consequences. For example, a terrorist who commits acts of violence in the name of their beliefs could also be seen as courageous, but their actions have no virtuous value whatsoever. Thus, it can be argued that courage is only a virtue when it is used for good, morality, and righteousness.\nIn conclusion, we can see that courage can be viewed as a virtue in certain situations, such as physical bravery or moral courage. However, it can only be a virtue when combined with wisdom and morality, and when used for the betterment of society and humanitarian causes. It is truly something that should be respected and upheld as a core virtue for all humankind.",

His non-violent approach and his great ideals of equality and justice have inspired people all over the world to stand up for what they believe in, even in the face of great adversity. His courage was a virtuous act, one that brought about change, created social revolution, and an end to oppression and intolerance.\nIn conclusion, it is true that courage can be manifested in various forms, for different reasons, and hence can have both positive and negative outcomes. Therefore, courage cannot be considered as necessarily a virtue by itself. However, when it is exercised for the good of humanity, as in the form of physical courage in times of conflict, indomitable resilience in the quest for individual identity, and moral courage in fighting for change, then it is a virtue. Courage is indeed a trait that can inspire others to create social revolution, achieve greater goals, and bring about a better and more just world. As we continue to hold courage in high esteem, it is important to note that it is only through the combination of virtues such as courage, knowledge, wisdom and opinion, we can truly make a positive difference in the world.",

He initiated and took part in peaceful demonstrations to fight for equality and justice for African Americans in a society plagued by deep-seated racism. In his famous speech \"I Have a Dream\", he boldly visualised a future of shared brotherhood where people were judged by the content of their character rather than the colour of their skin. Martin Luther King Jr.'s courage under fire galvanised a movement that forced society to confront and strive for true equality. These selfless acts of courage are the very embodiment of moral virtue, with the potential to bring out the best in humanity and transform our world for the better.\nHowever, one cannot ignore the fact that courage may also lead to negative consequences when not grounded in knowledge, wisdom and opinion. Without proper understanding or when driven solely by personal interest, unbridled courage can turn into recklessness and exhibition of false bravado. For instance, the delusions that drove the recent Capitol Hill riots in the United States show how misguided courage can spiral into violence and disorder, and how vitriol can be substituted for honour. The real question becomes whether or not courage can be considered a virtue in such instances. Courage may be necessary for individual survival at times, but it must always be grounded in ethical and moral imperatives. Courage without purpose and direction can lead to disaster, hence, it is not a virtue in and of itself.\nTo conclude, although courage is not necessarily a virtue in all circumstances, it has the potential to be virtuous when accompanied by knowledge, wisdom and opinion. The positive impact of courageous acts in history and society cannot be understated. However, when courage is misguided, it can lead to disastrous and negative outcomes. Ultimately, only when courage is directed towards a higher moral purpose, can it truly be seen as a virtue that uplifts humanity and inspires us to be our best selves.",

His courageous acts, such as the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the March on Washington, have become integral elements of American history and an example of how a positive moral force can change outdated social systems. Therefore, moral courage should be viewed as one of the most virtuous acts of courage, in the sense that it changes both individuals and society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, is courage necessarily a virtue? The answer is not straightforward, as courage can have both positive and negative consequences. However, when courage is combined with knowledge, wisdom and good judgement, it can become a virtue that empowers both individuals and society, as seen through examples of physical, individualistic and moral courage.

Physical courage can be a virtue in the face of external threats, whilst individualistic courage is a virtue in the quest for individual identity and the breaking of societal norms. Moral courage can be a virtue in fighting for change and risking embarrassment rather than tolerate injustice.

His unwavering moral courage ultimately resulted in the passing of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, creating an indelible impact on American society for generations to come. Both Mother Teresa and Martin Luther King Jr. demonstrated that moral courage takes a different form than physical courage, but is no less virtuous. In fact, it can be argued that moral courage is more difficult than physical courage, as it involves standing up for one's beliefs regardless of the potential backlash or ostracism.\n\nIn conclusion, courage can be viewed as a virtue only when it is combined with knowledge, wisdom and opinion. It is not enough to simply be brave in the face of danger or opposition \u2013 one must use their courage to create a positive impact on society. Individuals like the French resistance group, Vincent Van Gogh, Pablo Picasso, Mother Teresa, and Martin Luther King Jr. were all virtuous in their displays of courage because they used it to bring about positive change.

Courage in the eyes of a misguided individual may lead to disastrous consequences. A prime example is the 9/11 terrorist attack on the Twin Towers in New York City. The terrorists who executed the plan had a misguided courage \u2013 the courage to pursue their unjust cause even after considering the consequences of their extremist activities. The results were disastrous, causing immense harm and an outright ripple effect of pain which has persisted for years, causing immense pain and suffering to countless innocent individuals. The courage to hurt and destroy has never been, and will never be, virtuous.\nIn conclusion, courage can undoubtedly be viewed as a virtue, but only in the right context. The courage that is channeled and centered towards virtuous acts will bring about positive change in the world. It is this courage that must be rooted in wisdom and knowledge of the world rather than an unreasonable idealism as it has the potential to unify and strengthen millions of people across the world.

His contribution to society has been invaluable; he represents true courage, where courage is utilised in the fight against injustice in the society. His courage and virtue had a significant and positive impact on society and has inspired countless generations since his time.\nIn conclusion, courage, when displayed as a virtue, is most praiseworthy when it is coupled with knowledge, wisdom and vision - the famous Aristotle said \"courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees all others.\" Therefore, it is important that when we exhibit courage, we also ensure that it is aligned with our values and principles, and contributes positively to our society and the world as a whole.

            "human_gen_truncate": "many American students, deemed as a fixture in American consciousness for many decades due to its examination of racial injustice. This shows how novels are able to both educate students on the struggles faced by certain segments of society, as well as to model for students how they can stand up and speak out against injustice. This would undoubtedly improve one'ssocial skills in terms of how they empathise and how they relate to other individuals. Hence, this shows how works of fiction still hold an important place in society, in addressing pertinent issues in the world and empowering individuals to eradicate these problems.\nIn addition, a commonly cited reason that parents encourage children to read from a young age is that reading novels improves creativity. By reading more books, children would be able to expose themselves to new and more information. This would develop creativity in children, allowing them to come up with more innovative ideas. Through the interesting characters as well as creative story plots that are woven together intrinsically by authors, this develops a child'sability to think imaginatively. As compared to spending time playing video games and surfing the Internet, reading books is an activity that forces the reader to ditch distractions and focus. It is this said focus that acts as a catalyst for an increase in creativity. This is because books are a window to the world \u2013 allowing a glimpse into cultures past, present and future, as interpreted by their authors and filtered through our own imaginations. Children who read novels from a young age would be able to discover an amazing amount of information, especially at a young age when they are more impressionable. The more children know, the more they will be able to share, ultimately shaping them to become better conversationalists, quicker thinkers and better problem solvers in the future.\nHowever, just as with all things, novels do have a negative side to them that hold no value in bettering one'slife. In order for us to reap the benefits of reading novels, we as readers need to be selective in what we choose to read. There are close to 130 million books in the world, and it would be naive to assume that all novels hold an equal value to an individual. While there are novels that stimulate one'sintellect and improve creativity, there also exist novels that encourage morally unsound values. An example would be the genre of erotic novels. Novels such as \"Twilight\" by Stephenie Meyer, or E. L. Jame's\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" certainly would not hold any value in bettering one'slife. This is because these books do not focus on inculcating the right values in its readers, but instead promote the culture of pre-marital sex, which may not coincide with the values that readers have been taught. Hence, one would probably not gain any of the abovementioned benefits if one chooses to read books that are of no significant value.Thus, one can see that rather than generalize whether novels are a waste of time, it is far better to scrutinize each novel individually. Some novels tend to have more educational value; others, moral value, and it is up to readers to be discerning and seek out books of quality, not just chick-lit romance novels that teach us little and can be justified as \"a waste of time\" as the question suggests..

This shows how values are equally as important as academic credentials in helping one secure a job, as well as to thrive in the workforce. Since the primary responsibility of schools is to prepare students for the workforce, they should also prepare students to deal with situations that will test their resilience and character in the future.\nIn addition, the goals of the education system globally are to meet the emotional needs and aid in the emotional development of the child as stated in Article 29 of the United Nations Charter on the Rights to an Education. This shows that governments and world leaders recognize the vital role that schools play in nurturing a child. Several countries have already put in place measures to help a child develop to his fullest potential by ensuring that the emotional needs are met by conducting programmes to teach children values and develop their character. In 2012, the Singapore government introduced the Edusave Character Award, and every year since it was introduced, rewards have been given to the students who have demonstrated excellent character and are role models for their peers. This further helps to emphasize the point that schools are not merely places to accrue knowledge, but are also places for holistic development. Some students view their teachers as \"second parents\" and do approach them for advice with difficulties they face beyond their academic work. Teachers, in this sense, are responsible for guiding their students in the right direction and urging them to make the best possible decisions in the future.\nHowever, some point out that the current education system is already over-laden with too many activities and programmes, and schools should not be made to bear the sole responsibility of imparting values to a child as well. Many would argue that it is the role of the parents to do so. I believe that parents do hold a great influence over their child and should work together with the schools in order to impart good values to their children. Teachers today already have much on their plate, to cope with not just teaching, but other administrative duties as well. Given they have so many students in one class to manage, it would also not be reasonable or realistic to expect a teacher to be responsible for so many students at a time. Moreover, parents are the main caregivers in a child'slife, and studies have shown that parents prove to have the most significant influence on shaping a child'sdevelopment and character in their growing years. Hence, parents should also be taking an active role in ensuring that students have sound morals.\nIn conclusion, schools should teach values as well as knowledge in order to complement what children learn at home and prepare them for future challenges. Certain scenarios that children encounter in school are similar to what one would expect in the workforce, albeit on a smaller scale and with fewer consequences. Teaching students how to cope with these challenges will go a long way in preparing them for the future and helping them reach their full potential.",

By incorporating values that engender compassion and empathy, students can better understand the feelings of people around them. For example, a student who is taught the value of \"care\" would be more likely to show concern for someone who is having a bad day. In this way, values encourage students to develop emotional intelligence, which is necessary to succeed in society.\n\nLastly, values provide a foundation for a well-rounded education. While knowledge is essential in professions like medicine, engineering, or law, values are just as important. Success in life does not necessarily depend on one's intellect alone but also on one's ability to interact with others and be a good team player. Simply put, values are crucial to personal growth and self-awareness.\n\nSome may argue that values should be taught at home instead of schools. While it is true that parents play the most significant role in molding their child's character, schools can reinforce the values taught at home. Schools provide a platform for a more comprehensive approach to teaching values. It exposes students to different perspectives, allows them to engage in debate and discussion, and teaches them that diverse opinions and beliefs are respected while building a moral compass that only they can adhere to.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that schools should not only teach knowledge but values as well. Integrating values into the curriculum encourages students to become responsible adults, fosters a sense of social responsibility, builds emotional intelligence, and creates a foundation for personal growth.

For example, if students are taught the importance of environmental sustainability, they are more likely to make a conscious effort to reduce their carbon footprint. Such actions will not only benefit the community at large but will also create a ripple effect that can have further benefits in the future.\nIn conclusion, knowledge alone cannot bring about complete success. It is important that schools also teach values, so that students are guided in making the right decisions and actions in life.

This is because co-curricular activities allow for the students to pick up new skills, interact with one another and learn to work as a team. These are all values that will carry them far beyond educational life.\n\nIn conclusion, schools need to teach values alongside knowledge as it creates an environment for students to be successful beyond their academic pursuits.

It is, therefore, paramount for schools to provide a conducive environment for students by teaching them good values so that they can be good people and citizens in society.\nIn conclusion, while the purpose of education entails teaching knowledge, teaching values should also be a part of the curriculum. The importance of teaching values in schools cannot be overstated. Students should be guided to make informed decisions based on sound beliefs and values. Moreover, a sound value system opens up opportunities in the workforce and it also creates a better learning environment for everyone.

            "prompt": "HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE THAT MODERN LIFE IS PLAGUED BY FEAR AND INSECURITY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "fe of modern man. At the societal level, rapid urbanization has resulted in a much more stressful pace of life with high-rise living causing people to feel more and more isolated in an increasingly impersonal world. The rise of online communications may have made our lives more convenient, yet it has also created a yawning gap between virtual reality and \"real\", physical, human interaction. The social malaise can also be felt in institutions such as marriage which has become more tenuous: marriage is less and less viewed as a sacred union between two people but more and more as a contract that can now be easily and conveniently terminated. At the same time, what used to be condemned as sins or crimes \u2013 abortion, homosexuality, children born out of wedlock \u2013 are now perceived as manifestations of an alternative lifestyle. With moral values in a shifting state of perpetual flux, it is no wonder that in the modern world we live in today, we are faced with greater uncertainty in our social lives.\nYet, it would be a mistake to focus merely on the negative aspects of modern society that evoke fear and insecurity, while neglecting those areas of our modern world that offer us enhanced security and reassurance. One area where this can be seen is the increased ease of life facilitated by modernization, where higher standards of living are achieved through a combination of the technological advancements and economic growth that we experience in our modern society. No doubt these may also generate a measure of fear and insecurity as discussed above, however we must also acknowledge that the greater convenience and comfort they bring through improved facilities and amenities have contributed to the well-being of our modern life. At the same time, the increased connectivity that we experience in our modern world can also bring about a stronger sense of community \u2013 both in real life and online \u2013 which can translate into easier access to overcome life'sdifficulties through counselling services and support groups from all over the world. This can in turn lead to a greater sense of assurance and stability in today'sworld.\nMoreover, it can also be argued that a measure of fear and insecurity can be desirable in our modern world as this serves to make us more vigilant and take precautionary measures to alleviate future ills. For instance, in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami of 2004, fears of similar future devastation drove many governments to set up advanced tsunami warning systems in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which brought much assurance to peoples living in coastal areas in these regions. Another example was the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 which caused widespread global panic and fear, yet following this incident, governments and hospitals started to implement tighter quarantine and monitoring procedures. This consequently contributed to more stability and less panic amongst medical personnel and the public when similar viruses such as H1N1 and avian flu struck in the following years. Hence to a certain extent, it can be said that fear and insecurity in our modern society may not always be something to avoid or be plagued with.\nIn essence, there is no denying that our modern world contains much to be fearful and insecure about as the daily newspapers continue to herald new threats, unprecedented challenges and previously-undiscovered risks. Yet, as the title of a recent book \u2013 \"Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?\" \u2013 implies, we have to be careful not to be overly pessimistic of the world we live in, or else we may become paralyzed and plagued by fear to the point that we fail to appreciate there is also much in our modern world that provides us with joy, safety and security.",

This, in turn, can lead to societal problems such as xenophobia, racism, and prejudice.\n\nMoreover, fear and insecurity can harm the economy. When people are constantly worried about their safety and security, they are less likely to spend money on discretionary items, leading to a decrease in consumer spending. It can also lead to a decrease in travel and tourism, which could further damage the economy, as these industries contribute significantly to global GDP. \n\nIn light of this, it is imperative that we explore solutions to mitigate the negative impact of fear and insecurity. One way to do this is by increasing communication and transparency amongst authorities and citizens. By providing clear and concise information about potential threats and the measures being taken to counter them, authorities can reduce public panic and alleviate anxiety. Additionally, investing in technology that can prevent cybercrime and protect personal information can also help alleviate the fears of individuals.\n\nEducation about these different threats and how to protect oneself against them is also crucial. By teaching people how to take the necessary precautions and identify potential threats, they can feel more empowered to take control of their own security and therefore have reduced levels of fear and insecurity. In essence, increased information and preparedness can help equip people with the necessary tools to deal with and manage various risks, ultimately reducing feelings of panic and fear.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that modern life is, unfortunately, plagued by fear and insecurity. We have seen that the rise of terrorism, cybercrime, and economic instability has created a constant state of anxiety and fear in the minds of individuals. This has serious implications for on both individuals and society, including poor decision making and potentially xenophobic societal behaviour. Despite this, various steps can be taken to reduce these negative effects, including increased transparency and education. By taking these steps, we can hope to promote a more secure and confident society.",

With the advent of social media and technology, there is a growing trend of cyberbullying, identity theft, and other forms of online harassment that have permeated the lives of many. The constant need to be connected online has also resulted in feelings of FOMO (fear of missing out), as individuals fear that they are not keeping up with their peers and missing out on important events in their lives. This has led to feelings of insecurity and anxiety, as individuals are constantly bombarded with unrealistic expectations and comparisons that can be damaging to their mental health and well-being.\nHowever, despite all these factors contributing to a sense of fear and insecurity in modern life, we should also acknowledge the many advancements and benefits that have come with modernity. The development of vaccines and medical treatments, the increased access to education and information, and the greater equality and diversity that exists in many societies are just a few of the positives that we should not overlook.\nIn conclusion, while I do agree that modern life is beset by many fears and insecurities, we must also acknowledge that we have made significant progress in many areas and should not be paralyzed by our anxiety.

The ubiquity of the internet and social media has also made it easier for individuals to be exposed to unwanted attention or harassment from anonymous online users, thus increasing the sense of insecurity and vulnerability for some.\nHowever, while it is true that the modern world has its fair share of fear and insecurity, we cannot ignore the other side of the coin. For all the new threats and risks that have emerged, there has also been a dramatic increase in the quantity and quality of safety measures that have been implemented to protect citizens from these risks. The development of surveillance cameras, strict border controls, stringent safety regulations and emergency response protocols all serve to reassure us that we are as well-protected as we have ever been. Furthermore, the contemporary world has also enabled us to experience more interconnectedness and diversity than ever before, with greater opportunities for international cooperation and mutual understanding. This has helped to ease tensions and dispel anxieties in some areas of the world where these were once the norm.\nIn conclusion, while there is no denying that modern life can be characterized by fear and insecurity, it would be too simplistic to present it as being totally plagued by them. Our fears are largely a product of our own success in creating a world that has become both more complex and more interconnected. However, for all the uncertainties and anxieties that the modern world presents us with, we need to take comfort in the fact that we have also been successful in creating a range of safeguards and countermeasures to protect ourselves from them.

With society's emphasis on success and achievement, individuals are often made to feel that their self-worth is contingent on their material wealth, grades and social status. This has led to a society that is plagued by an underlying sense of inadequacy and the fear of not measuring up to societal expectations. Whether it is the fear of failure in exams, fear of not meeting work targets or fear of not being accepted by one's peers, these anxieties can lead to physiological symptoms such as migraines, insomnia and depression.\nHowever, amidst the seemingly bleak and pessimistic picture that has been painted of modern society, we must not overlook the fact that modern society has also brought about many positive developments that have led to greater security and progress. Technological advancements in areas like medical science have led to breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases that were once considered incurable. The creation of international organizations such as the World Health Organization and the United Nations has brought about stability and cooperation among nations and peoples. In addition, improved surveillance systems, communication networks and transportation systems have also contributed to a sense of safety and orderliness in many parts of the world.\nIn conclusion, while it cannot be denied that modern life has presented us with a plethora of new fears and risks, it is important that we also recognize that modern society has brought about significant advancements and benefits that have contributed to greater security and stability.

By doing so, people can feel a sense of belonging and support, which can help to alleviate their fears.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that modern life is indeed constrained by fear and insecurity due to the numerous threats that exist in today's world.

This can be detrimental to social cohesion and may even lead to social unrest.\n\nSo, what can be done to alleviate the issue of fear and insecurity in modern life? Firstly, it is important for governments and international organizations to take steps to mitigate the causes of these fears. This can be done through measures such as increased security and surveillance to combat terrorism, stringent laws and regulations against cybercrime, and implementing strong economic policies to stabilize the economy. Secondly, individuals can take steps to reduce their own fears by being properly informed about the dangers that exist and taking precautionary measures, such as investing in personal security measures, insurance, and contingency planning.\n\nIn conclusion, while modern life has brought about many benefits, it cannot be denied that it has also brought about new forms of fear and insecurity. Terrorism, cybercrime, and economic instability are just some of the factors that have led to this phenomenon. The consequences of such fears are dire, and they can affect both individuals and society. However, with concerted efforts from governments and individuals, steps can be taken to reduce these fears and ensure a safer and more secure future."

            "human_gen_truncate": "gs. In fact, according to Phillip Morris, author of \"Peer Pressure and Smoking\", teenagers who had at least three friends who practiced underage smoking were ten times more likely to follow suit than those who did not. Moreover, data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicates that many more juvenile crimes are committed in groups as compared to adult crimes. This shows that juvenile delinquency can be attributed to the pressure teenagers face from their friends, as at that age, an individual'sthought pattern can be easily molded, and hence individuals are more easily involved in delinquent acts as a teenager. Teenagers may feel that he or she will be alone if they do not follow their peers, and this fear of isolation drives them to be part of a peer group, who might be indulging in negative activities. Therefore, other than child neglect, delinquency in juveniles could also happen due to the herd mentality and peer pressure faced.\nConversely, rather than negligence, parents can go the other extreme and spoil their children. As a result, even though they are involved in their children'slives, they fail to act as disciplinarians and therefore cannot keep their children in line. For instance, Hollywood actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie'schildren are notorious for bad behaviour, such as setting fire to leaves outdoors or being violent with fellow schoolchildren. This is often attributed by sources to the couple'scaring tendencies, particularly to the children they adopted. Moreover, with the vast amount of freedom granted, coupled with the abundance of material possessions and money these parents grant their children easily, children thus have more opportunities to mix with bad company and commit acts of felony. Therefore, although negligent parents can be the cause of juvenile delinquency, parents can also be over-caring and not have the heart to correct their children when necessary, leading to children lacking self-discipline.\nFurthermore, while parental negligence is a significant factor contributing to juvenile delinquency, it comes hand-in-hand with how children react to the lack of attention from their parents. While there is evidence proving that parental negligence does lead to higher instances of juvenile delinquency, there are children who faced child neglect growing up, but have not gotten into trouble with the law growing up, and were even able to attain success in life. It is true that children learn discipline and independence through the lack of support received from their parents, as they are also being corrected by other influences such as guardians or teachers, and it ultimately comes down to the attitude and tenacity of the child. Many celebrities such as Jamie Foxx, Kelly Clarkson and Adele were neglected by their parents at a young age and even throughout their teenage years. However, due to their spirit of resilience and strength, they chose to pick themselves up and fight hard for their dreams, despite the absence of their parents. This therefore allowed them to achieve success, and even motivated them to stay away from trouble. Therefore, whether children fall into the trap of juvenile delinquency depends on the attitude and resilience that they possess.\nUltimately, delinquency can certainly be attributed to parental negligence due to a parent'shuge role in a child'slife as his or her sole provider and source of support, as well as the root reason of a child'sneed for parental love. However, it must also be acknowledged that juvenile delinquency is caused by the interplay of factors ranging from peer pressure faced by youths, to the act of parents spoiling their children. Different cases of juvenile delinquency stem from different causes, but it is certain that a parent'srole in a child'slife cannot be replaced. Hence, I would agree that the most important factor for delinquency is the negligence of a child by his or her parents.",

Other factors such as peer pressure, poverty, and mental health issues also contribute to juvenile delinquency. Peer pressure, for instance, is a significant factor that influences adolescent behavior. Adolescents who associate with delinquent peers are more likely to engage in criminal activities (Schofield, 2018). Poverty, on the other hand, is linked to poor social and economic outcomes, which increase the likelihood of children engaging in delinquent activities. Additionally, mental health issues such as depression and anxiety can make children more vulnerable to negative influences, which can lead to delinquent behavior.\n\nAnother factor to consider when examining the relationship between parental negligence and juvenile delinquency is the impact of parental incarceration. Children whose parents are incarcerated are more likely to experience parental neglect and lack of supervision, which can lead to delinquency (Dong and Krohn, 2016). Moreover, the trauma of parental incarceration can cause emotional and behavioral problems that contribute to juvenile delinquency.\n\nIn conclusion, parental negligence is a significant factor contributing to the rise of juvenile delinquency. Children who experience parental neglect are more likely to engage in deviant behaviors, such as drug use and involvement in gangs. However, while parental negligence is one of the significant factors contributing to juvenile delinquency, it is not necessarily the most significant. Other factors such as peer pressure, poverty, and mental health issues also contribute to juvenile delinquency.

Similarly, those who suffer from mental illness may not be aware of the consequences of their actions, leading to delinquency.\nIn conclusion, while parental negligence is the most significant factor contributing to rising juvenile delinquency, it cannot be the only factor attributed to this issue. Peer pressure, poverty, lack of education and mental illness are all factors that can push teenagers towards delinquency.

Parents play a vital role in shaping the behavior, values and attitudes of their children from a young age, and a lack of parental guidance can have a detrimental impact.

However, this is not to say that other factors such as peer pressure and mental health issues do not play a part in teenage delinquency. Parents must provide emotional and physical support for their children as they grow up, while also ensuring that they guide their children in making the right decisions. It is only with proper attention and love that children can grow up positively and avoid negative influences that can lead them down the path of delinquency. Ultimately, it takes a community to raise a child, and families cannot be solely responsible for their child's development. Schools, community centres and religious organisations should work hand in hand with parents to provide the best support and guidance possible for teenagers, reducing the likelihood of them becoming delinquents.",

A child's upbringing plays a vital role in shaping his or her behavior and the lack of proper parenting can have long-lasting negative effects. Parents must, therefore, take the time to guide and support their children, providing them with the necessary love and care so that they can become responsible, well-adjusted teenagers and, eventually, successful adults.

In such cases, parental negligence might not be the main factor contributing to delinquency, but it can exacerbate the issue if the parents are not attentive or supportive of their child's coping mechanisms.\nIn conclusion, while parental negligence is undoubtedly the most significant factor contributing to rising juvenile delinquency, other factors such as peer pressure and stress may also contribute to this issue. However, it is essential that parents take an active role in nurturing their children and providing them with the needed emotional and physical support they require.

Parents play a crucial role in the development of their children; however, with increased workloads and busy lifestyles, many parents have neglected their duties in providing adequate emotional and physical support for their children. Without proper guidance and a positive role model, teenagers may be easily swayed by external influences and may turn to delinquent behaviours.

This can lead to truancy, substance abuse or even criminal behaviour.\nIn conclusion, while parental negligence is the most significant factor contributing to rising juvenile delinquency, it is not the only factor to be considered. It is important for parents to recognize the importance of their role in raising their children and play an active part in shaping their child'scharacter. At the same time, society must also recognise the pressures that teenagers face and work towards providing them with a healthy environment that promotes positive development. There must also be more support and resources available for families who need assistance in raising their children.

However, some Singaporeans were unhappy about it. This puts Singapore'sgovernment in a tight spot because they could lose popularity and thus lose its governance over Singapore. Of course, that would be destabilizing to the country if it were to become reality. Hence a good government would have to recognise the fact that the people'ssupport is important. They must be able to reach out to people and allow them to understand the benefits of their policies. In this sense, Singapore has managed to fulfil this through platforms such as \"Our Singapore Conversations\" where individuals give feedback and also learn more about current policies. This ensures that people do not feel alienated from the government'sdecisions and the government would be able to remain in control. Therefore, a good government must not only have the courage to make unpopular decisions but also be able to remain in power through good communications with the people.\nNevertheless, being stubborn in making unpopular decisions could end up harming citizens instead. This can occur when governments are ignorant of the current situation or if the government is corrupt. An ignorant government may mistake the possible merits of the decision or they could underestimate the costs of the decision. These policies are more often than not opposed by citizens of the country. In such situations, having the courage to implement the policy despite strong opposition can lead to undesirable outcomes for the country. To illustrate this, Brazil won the bid to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, the victory was not celebrated by many. With many parts of the country undeveloped and social services uncared for, many Brazilians were not keen on the idea of spending billions of dollars on huge soccer stadiums that would serve no other purpose other than hosting the World Cup. As such, the disgruntled members of the public took to the streets and carried out massive protests, hampering the preparations and infrastructure building for the World Cup. Although the government justified its spending by citing the huge tourism revenue and the boosting of Brazil'simage, much of their claims were overly optimistic. Multiple economic studies have shown that hosting major sporting events have more often than not led to more social problems and negative economic benefits. People'sstandard of living might deteriorate because of the huge debt the government might incur. In such scenarios, courage and confidence are often baseless and detrimental to society. The incompetence of the government led to failure and the people suffering as an unfortunate consequence. Hence, having the courage to make unpopular decisions might not be the mark of a good government if such unpopular decisions are clearly detrimental to the society.\nAll in all, a good government has to have the foresight and courage to make decisions that are beneficial and necessary for the country regardless of how unpopular it may be. It should also be astute enough to ensure its citizens still pledge support to it. Only through this way can the government implement policies that will benefit the nation in the long run.

As such, Singapore'scultural identity as a nation with people of diverse ethnicities living in harmony needs to rely much on the shared knowledge of past events.\nIn the chase for modernity and instantaneity, many Singaporeans believe that holding on to the past is sentimental to the point of being impractical. They would rather Singapore be defined by where we are going, not where we came from. Sadly, such a perspective is self-defeating. Without retrospect, there can be no progress, nor purpose. After all, the past offers us valuable lessons and ideas that can help us progress and prevent us from repeating the mistakes we made in the past. One famous example would be how Singapore learnt its lesson from the Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 that was sparked by tension due to the traditions of one race not being respected by the law. Thus, with such knowledge of the past, Singapore has managed to prevent race-related strife from brewing through adequate public education and respect for all races in legislation. This shows that with an understanding of the past comes a better understanding of how Singapore should manage the present and future generations in order to create an environment that allows holistic progress.\nYet another reason that a sense of history is so crucial to Singapore'sfuture is because a sense of history is not something static or unable to adapt with the times. Rather, it serves as a guide to prevent us from straying too far from the desired status quo for peace, harmony and progress. For example, after the horrifying terror events of September 11 and the Bali bombings of 2004, the peace in multi-religious Singapore became extremely fragile. This was when ministers such as then-senior minister Lee Kuan Yew reminded the country of how precious peace between ethnic groups was, and how Singapore needs to be resilient and not stray off from the mutual respect each and every ethnicity had for each other. Therefore, it was through an understanding and reverence for the past that Singapore has managed to solve the most pressing issues of its modern self.\nHence, for Singapore, or any country for that matter, to sustainably progress and succeed in the future, a shared sense of history is crucial, if not necessary. It stops us from repeating past mistakes, teaches us to handle current issues and bonds the country through the shared identity forged in the past.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ld war in the near future. Despite Iran'sclaims that its atomic bomb research is peaceful, Israel disapproves of the United Nation'snuclear watchdog decision to withhold reports of suspicions that Iran researched on how to make an atomic bomb \u2013 a potential hazard to Iran'sneighbouring countries \u2013 for reasons of diplomatic sensitivity. It is understandable for Israel, which is the only nation in the Middle East comprising Jews, to feel threatened with its Islamic neighbouring countries possessing nuclear weaponry. For Israel, this will be the proverbial \"straw that breaks the camel'sback\" and a world war may likely be triggered if Israel is pressurized to attack countries in the Middle East in the name of \"self-defence\". Therefore, the prospect of a future world war in the near future can be entertained or even, acknowledged with serious consideration, due to the greater risks of global destruction posed by the development of nuclear weapons.\nFurthermore, the ultimate reason that sparks a world war \u2013 the desire for power \u2013 has remained unchanged throughout the years. Like the Cold War, which broke out between the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc in a futile attempt to gain more geopolitical power, who is to say that another world war will not break out in the near future whereby countries attempt to monopolise global influence? Although there are regional and international policies implemented today that are serving their purpose in allocating resources in a fair and equitable manner, there are, however, exceptions where countries are not content with their lot. The innate desire of countries to dominate power, coupled with the global issue of resource depletion, increases the possibility that a world war may break out in the near future as countries engage in a desperate struggle for resources. A recent event that has been dubbed as a potential world war event is the China-Japan conflict due to Japan'sacquisition of the Senkaku islands. While Japan claims that the disputed lands were vacant before 1895, China argues that it owned the islands before 1895 based on ancient Chinese texts and maps which show that the Chinese regarded the islands as theirs. In other words, Japan'sseizure of the islands violated China'srights. But ultimately, is it not the desire to gain more power from the acquisition of lands the sole reason for the disputes between countries? In addition, with the ability of countries to lend, or remove, support to countries in conflict today due to the growing interdependence of countries, there is a possibility of a future world war if many countries are involved in the same conflict. Saying that the possibility of a world war in the future cannot be entertained is thus na\u00efve taking into consideration that the desire for power of countries has remained largely unchanged throughout the years.\nWhile some may argue that economic sanctions imposed can deter a future world war event, the truth is that there are ways to circumvent these as there will always be other states to supply and provide supplies and markets. In recent times, economic sanctions, rather than military force, are often employed in a crisis to interrupt commercial relations and weaken the economy, and by extension, the military potential of the country being sanctioned. Sanctions buy time, allowing adversaries to consider the repercussions of countries acting on a moment of impulse to trigger a world war. This ultimately deters a future world war event from occurring. However, sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving this primary aim. Despite imposing economic sanctions on Russia by countries like Germany and the United States because of its aggressive actions in Crimea to hamper trade and cripple its economy, there are other countries such as China, who are willing to supply and trade its goods with Russia. Russia is still able to get by, even with the meagre source of income from trade with only a few trading countries. Worse, sanctions may sometimes provoke the victim country instead to retaliate in other ways, possibly by resorting to military violence. Therefore, the possibility of a world war in the near future can be entertained for the fact that economic sanctions \u2013 one of the factors commonly used to prevent a world war from occurring \u2013 is actually proven to be largely ineffective.\nTo conclude, it may seem that the chances of a world war occurring in the near future are becoming smaller because in today, more and more countries are increasingly interdependent on one another for trade and other relations. However, the possibility of a world war occurring in the near future must still be entertained.",

As climate change accelerates, resource scarcity may become a flashpoint for conflicts, particularly among countries facing severe ecological or economic challenges.\n\nMoreover, a potential world war may also be triggered by political misunderstandings and distrust. Miscommunication or miscalculation among countries, coupled with a lack of diplomatic channels, may lead to tensions and ultimately a full-blown conflict.\n\nDespite the possibility of a world war, there are steps that can be taken to prevent it. First and foremost, it is crucial to reinforce international institutions and norms that promote cooperation and peaceful settlements of conflicts. Countries should work towards strengthening existing institutions like the United Nations and the World Trade Organization and establish new ones to address emerging challenges like cybersecurity and climate change.\n\nFurthermore, countries should prioritize diplomacy and dialogue over confrontation and coercion. States need to engage in meaningful dialogue with their rivals and work towards building consensus and understanding. Confidence-building measures like arms control and military-to-military communication can reduce the risk of miscommunication and miscalculation.\n\nLastly, countries must tackle the root causes of conflicts and instability, including poverty, inequality, and authoritarianism. Addressing these factors can reduce the risk of violent conflict and promote a more stable and peaceful international system.\n\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be entirely dismissed. The current global political landscape is marked by several factors that may lead to conflicts and escalate into a larger and more destructive conflict.

Moreover, terrorists may obtain nuclear weapons and use them to inflict destruction and chaos on a global scale. Such uncertainty makes the possibility of a world war worth considering.\nFurthermore, the desire of countries to dominate others is a factor that increases the likelihood of a world war occurring in the near future. Countries often engage in activities such as espionage and cyber warfare to gain advantage over others. Such activities give rise to a sense of insecurity and mistrust, leading to the possibility of a conflict between countries. The quest for dominance may also lead to the formation of alliances among countries for strategic purposes. These alliances may be seen as threatening by other countries, leading to a larger conflict involving more countries, which is characteristic of a world war.\nLastly, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring cannot be ignored. Sanctions have been employed as a tool to prevent countries from engaging in hostile activities towards other countries. However, the effectiveness of sanctions is limited as they often hurt innocent civilians more than the intended target. The inability of sanctions to achieve their goals may lead to a country resorting to more drastic measures, including the use of military force, leading to a wider conflict involving multiple countries.\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that the possibility of a world war in the near future is not a far-fetched idea. The development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate, the failure of sanctions, and the limitations of soft power are all factors that may contribute to a global conflict. It is therefore crucial for countries to continue engaging in efforts to establish peaceful relations with other countries and work towards resolving conflicts through peaceful means rather than resorting to war.",
                "ld war. The Cold War is a prime example of how the arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union resulted in heightened tensions and a global standoff of military and ideological power. A miscalculation from either side could have resulted in a catastrophic loss of life and the destruction of vast areas of land, and if we take into account the fact that nuclear weapons are now more advanced than ever before, the consequences of a world war could be even more disastrous than in previous conflicts.\nMoreover, the pursuit of global domination is another factor that makes the possibility of a world war in the future possible. The thirst for power has long been a motivation for countries to engage in conflicts, and the current global climate is no different. China\u2019s aggressive approach towards asserting its claims in the South China Sea, for example, risks triggering a conflict that could easily escalate into a wider confrontation between other nations. Furthermore, the rise of nationalist, isolationist governments around the world, such as the United States under the Trump administration, could lead to increased global tensions as countries put their own interests first, often at the expense of other countries. This \u201cmy country first\u201d mentality only serves to further the divide between countries and could lead to a dangerous and unpredictable global environment.\nFinally, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring is a sobering reminder that conflict may be inevitable. Despite the use of sanctions and diplomacy to resolve conflicts, history has shown that countries are often willing to engage in conflict when their vital interests are at stake. The failure of sanctions to prevent the Iraq War in 2003, for example, highlights the limitations of diplomacy and shows that countries are not always willing to compromise and seek peaceful solutions to avoid conflict.\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be entirely discounted, despite the efforts of countries to pursue soft power and avoid conflict. The development of nuclear weapons, the pursuit of global domination, and the failure of sanctions to prevent conflict all serve as reminders that the prospect of a world war is a very real danger. It is imperative that countries work together to promote peace and stability in the world, and to place diplomacy and compromise at the forefront of their efforts to prevent conflict.",
                "ld war. Furthermore, the ill-disciplinary acts of nuclear weapon states - which have failed to comply with international agreements to reduce the number of nuclear warheads - heightens the probability that a world war may happen. North Korea, for instance, has conducted several intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) tests which have not only violated United Nations (UN) Security Council resolutions but also escalated tensions both regionally and globally. Their actions had prompted other countries to increase their military forces, and led to the destabilization of relationships between countries. It is therefore evident that nuclear arms remain a major concern in the quest for global peace, and that the risk of a world war is high if countries do not take measures to reduce, let alone eliminate, these arms.\nFinally, the desire of countries to dominate others is a clear assertion that a world war can still happen in the near future. This desire, which is often manifested in their military policies, undermines the peaceful coexistence of nation-states and stokes up animosity amongst them.When one country's desire for supremacy is not checked, it spurs retaliatory actions from other countries. This can escalate into a worldwide conflict if there is little room for dialogue and compromise. An example would be China's territorial disputes in the South China Sea, where it has been expanding its territory by building artificial islands and militarising them. This move has not only sparked off tensions with neighbouring countries, but has led to the involvement of major military powers such as the United States. When China refuses to adhere to the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which favors other countries' claims in the region, it demonstrates that the possibility of a world war is still lurking in the shadows.\nIn conclusion, while the emergence of soft power as a tool to reduce external conflicts is no doubt necessary, it cannot overlook the fact that a world war can still be entertained. Nuclear arms, the desire to dominate and the inefficacy of sanctions serve as stern reminders that the world is still a volatile place. It is thus important for nation-states to pursue diplomacy as a means of resolving external conflicts, instead of relying on aggressive military policies. Only when countries are willing to recognize each other's strengths and weaknesses, and compromise and cooperate with each other, can the world move towards a more peaceful global community, and prevent the terrible prospect of a world war from becoming a reality.",
                "ld war. The recent missile tests by North Korea, for instance, have caused widespread alarm among Asian-Pacific nations, compelling the US to provide them with more security guarantees in return for their loyalty. The action of North Korea highlights the fact that the relative stability in the international system has been threatened, and that the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be ignored.\nFurthermore, the desire of countries to dominate presents another risk factor leading to the possibility of a global conflict in the near future. In many instances, countries have pursued a policy of aggressive expansionism to enhance their hegemony over other countries. The Greek scholar Thucydides once observed that \"the strong do what they have the power to do and the weak accept what they have to accept\". The implications of such actions is that the stronger states tend to bully weaker states and this may lead to global tensions escalating to a point where a military conflict may break out. For example, China's recent assertiveness in the South China Sea is worrying as it threatens the sovereignty of smaller countries such as the Philippines, which may be compelled to respond viciously, thus possibly triggering a conflict. The reality is that such policies toward annexation only serve as a recipe for military conflict. This once again brings us to the probability of conflicts arising between countries and a world war becoming a possibility.\nFinally, the failure of sanctions to prevent conflict from occurring can also be considered as an indicator that the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be ignored. Sanctions have been a popular means of imposing collective pressure on countries that violate international norms. However, the effectiveness of sanctions in reducing the conflicts between nations has been reduced, and they have resulted in greater hostility between countries. In some cases, sanctions have backfired on countries, which have responded by adopting more aggressive policies, thereby increasing the risk of conflict. For example, the recent imposition of sanctions by the US on Iran have only increased Iran's determination to pursue its nuclear programme, further fueling hostility between the two nations and leading to the possibility of a future war.\nIn conclusion, while the world is currently trending toward soft power as a means of conflict resolution, it is still apparent that other factors continue to prop up the probability of a world war happening in the near future. The existence of nuclear weapons, coupled with countries' desires for domination, suggests that conflict is a possibility. In the face of such grim prospects, it is the responsibility of all nations to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts and avoid getting embroiled in a world war, which would only result in mutual destruction and, ultimately, failure to achieve lasting peace and prosperity.",
                "ld war. For instance, the ongoing tension between North Korea and the United States has been escalating due to North Korea's nuclear weapons program. Recently, North Korea has demonstrated its nuclear capabilities by testing several intercontinental ballistic missiles, which has been met with stern opposition from the international community. Such a situation indicates the increasing possibility of a world war in the near future as countries would be wary of any perceived threat and would retaliate to protect their national interests.\nFurthermore, countries' desires to dominate and assert their power over others may lead to a world war. In fact, the story of the world has been one of power struggles that often result in violent conflicts. Human history is replete with examples of expansion efforts and conflicts between nations such as Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan in the 20th century. In modern times, China's rapid economic growth has fuelled its desire to assert its power and influence globally, leading to their ongoing territorial disputes with its neighbours. In such a scenario, countries may go to war to impose their dominance and influence on other nations leading to a catastrophic world war.\nLastly, the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring is a possibility that cannot be ignored. Sanctions are often used as a diplomatic tool for countries to pressure another country to change its behaviour. However, it is common for countries to resent such impositions and resist the sanctions imposed against them. For instance, when the international community imposed sanctions on Iraq in the 1990s, the Iraqi people suffered greatly from the humanitarian crisis that ensued. Moreover, the sanctions were not successful in altering the policies of the Iraqi government in question. Sanctions could, therefore, lead to an increase in tensions between countries, which could lead to an outbreak of a world war in the future.\nIn conclusion, while the notion of soft power as a means of resolving conflicts is plausible, it is not an ultimate solution to preventing a world war from occurring. The risks from nuclear weapons research, countries' desires to assert and dominate each other, and the failure of sanctions put the world in a precarious situation. Therefore, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be ignored, and countries must work towards fostering stronger diplomatic relations to prevent such an occurrence. ",
                "ld war. The countries with nuclear capabilities will often try to flex their muscles, leading to an increased likelihood of an all-out war. For instance, the conflict between the United States and North Korea escalated when North Korea tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). This led to the United States imposing an economic boycott, which can lead to further hostilities between the two countries. The fear of an accidental nuclear strike or the use of nuclear weapons as a last resort also contributes to the likelihood of a world war. It suggests that the considerations for nuclear disarmament should be a priority globally, in a bid to prevent a world war from occurring.\nAnother contributing factor to the likelihood of a world war is the ambition of some countries to dominate, economically and socially. Russia and China are two countries that have shown the will to dominate not only their regions but also the world as a whole. Russia's annexation of Crimea and its support for separatist rebels in Ukraine, coupled with China's claims over territories in the South China Sea demonstrate the willingness of these countries to establish their dominance and influence in the world. These moves can trigger a domino effect, leading to more countries expanding their spheres of influence, in an attempt to counterbalance the emerging superpowers. When the balance of power is threatened, aggression and war become the natural responses. Therefore, it is reasonable for us to harbour thoughts of a world war occurring in the near future if these countries continue to pursue their expansionist goals.\nLastly, the failure of sanctions to prevent war is another reason to entertain the possibility of a world war. Sanctions \u2013 an economic tool used to force countries into changing their behaviourand abandon their hostile actions have not always been successful in preventing wars. For instance, sanctions were imposed on Iraq in the early 1990s, when it defied United Nations resolutions by invading Kuwait. However, the prolonged sanctions had the opposite effect, leading to resentment and a greater aversion for the United States, eventually leading to the Iraq War in 2003. Similarly, in the case of Iran, sanctions have not achieved the desired outcome of halting its nuclear program. The failure of sanctions to coerce Iran and North Korea to abandon their nuclear research has led to further instability and aggression in their respective regions, increasing the likelihood of a world war.\nIn conclusion, it is justified to entertain the possibility of a world war in the near future due to the development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate, the failure of sanctions, and the exploitation of soft power. Therefore, countries should revisit and enforce arms control, negotiate to reduce tensions, and continue striving for peaceful solutions.",
                "ld war. For instance, North Korea's quest to establish a nuclear arsenal has sparked widespread fears about the possibility of an impending war, given the regime's open threats to attack neighbouring countries like South Korea and Japan. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) aimed to discourage the spread of nuclear weapons and regulate the peaceful use of nuclear technologies. However, some countries like North Korea have disregarded these regulations, hence threatening the peace and stability of the global community. The failure of the NPT to prevent countries from developing nuclear weapons is thus a sign that the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be ruled out.\nMoreover, the desire of countries to dominate and expand their territories is another factor that increases the possibility of a world war. Countries with expansionist agendas may use force to capture territories belonging to other countries, hence triggering a war. The ongoing conflict in Ukraine, for instance, is a result of Russia's ambitions to annex Crimea and assert its dominance in the region. Russia's expansionist intentions have increased tensions between it and Ukraine, and may have severe implications for the stability of Europe, if the conflict escalates to a larger conflict involving other countries. Other countries, such as China, have also been accused of using force to expand their territories in the South China Sea, a move that has ignited tensions with neighbouring countries such as Vietnam and the Philippines. With such disputes arising frequently, the chances of a world war cannot be completely dismissed.\nIn conclusion, while the trend towards soft power may reduce tensions, it cannot be viewed as a panacea towards preventing a world war from happening, due to its subjective nature. The development of nuclear weapons and the failure of the NPT to prevent their spread, in addition to the desire of countries to dominate and expand their territories, all lend support to the possibility of a world war in the near future. It is thus imperative for countries to remain vigilant and to engage in diplomacy as a means of resolving disputes, to prevent such a possibility from becoming a reality.",
                "ld war. The rising tensions between the US and North Korea, for instance, due to the fear of North Korea's nuclear capabilities, highlight the dangers of nuclear weapons research and its ability to potentially spark a world war. The possession and development of nuclear weapons by countries, especially those with volatile leaders, make the possibility of a world war in the near future a realistic concern that cannot be ignored.\nFurthermore, the desire of countries to dominate may lead to the emergence of a world war. Competition for resources such as oil, water and land may cause countries to engage in conflict. The conflict over resources in the South China Sea is an example of how countries may engage in a struggle for dominance and access to resources. In addition, when powerful countries use their influence to take advantage of weaker countries, tension and hostility may arise, and smaller countries might become pawns in their game of dominance. As a result, the greed of countries can lead to potential conflicts and spark a world war in the future.\nLastly, sanctions, which is touted as a peaceful method to deter countries from aggression, may not always work and may instead lead to the emergence of conflicts that could escalate to a world war. Sanctions that are not cooperative and instead seek to inflict harm on a country's economy can lead to retaliation and the rising of hostility towards a country. The example of North Korea, which has been under various sanctions from the United Nations, highlight the failure of sanctions to deter its nuclear weapons program and its hostile stance towards the world. Instead, sanctions have only worsened the situation and made the possibility of a world war more probable.\nIn conclusion, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be dismissed due to the various factors mentioned. The failure of soft power, the development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate, and the inefficacy of sanctions illustrate that the possibility of a world war in the future is still a real and sobering concern. It is critical, therefore, for countries to work together to prevent any potential conflicts from escalating, and to focus on building a strong framework of peace and cooperation that would ensure stability and prosperity for the world.",
                "ld war. North Korea is an example of a country that has been actively developing nuclear weapons despite numerous sanctions from the international community. Their pursuit of nuclear weapons has threatened the peace and stability in the region and has led to heightened tensions between North Korea and its neighbours, South Korea and Japan. It remains a possibility, therefore, that the development of nuclear weapons research may pave the way for a world war to occur should one of these countries use nuclear weapons as a form of aggression.\nMoreover, the desire of countries to dominate continues to fuel the possibility of a world war in the future. Countries' motives to establish power and dominance over others may cause them to act unscrupulously. This desire to dominate is exemplified in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East. Countries such as Saudi Arabia and Iran have been involved in a proxy war in Yemen, and their rivalries have further destabilised the region. The involvement of major countries such as the United States and Russia has only served to exacerbate the situation. The situation in the Middle East is a reminder that the possibility of a world war cannot be ruled out as long as countries continue to pursue their own interests at the expense of others.\nLastly, sanctions have failed to prevent conflicts from escalating into world wars in the past. The United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. The sanctions caused significant damage to the Iraqi economy and led to high levels of suffering among the Iraqi people. Despite this, Iraq refused to comply with the demands of the international community, leading to the Gulf War in 1991. This serves as a reminder that if countries are unwilling to comply with sanctions, conflict may escalate, leading to a world war.\nIn conclusion, although soft power may reduce tensions between countries, the development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate, and the failure of sanctions to prevent conflicts from escalating into world wars cannot be ignored. These factors reveal that the possibility of a world war cannot be entirely ruled out and should be entertained. Hence, countries must work hand-in-hand to identify and resolve potential issues before they escalate into a global conflict.",
                "ld war. The recent intrusions of North Korea in its nuclear weapons research, defying international sanctions, show how dangerous nuclear weaponry can be in the hands of unpredictable regimes. The possession of nuclear weapons raises the stakes, a situation that can become a dangerous game of chicken \u2013 similar to the Cold War era. When countries feel threatened and risks outweigh benefits, leaders are more likely to use their last resort \u2013 nuclear attack \u2013 which could lead to global devastation. It is undeniable that nuclear weapons are a real concern to the world, they must be effectively managed, and loopholes and gaps must be addressed to prevent the outbreak of a potential world war.\nFurthermore, the desire of countries to dominate is another threat that may cause a world war to occur. As history has shown, countries tend to compete against one another in terms of economy, resources or territorial claims. This competition's result has led to a long list of wars throughout history. Nowadays, countries continue to compete for regional and global superiority. China, for example, has been strongly claiming its vast maritime historical territory in the East and South China Sea, which has been met with backlash from its neighbours.The United States is still a major power and continues to be assertive in maintaining its influence over economic and political policies of other countries. These aggressive actions increase the likelihood of conflicts and the potential for global war. Despite a plethora of international law and diplomacy to solve territorial disputes, countries need to restrain from asserting their influence as doing so will only taint their international reputation and increase their vulnerability to retaliatory warfare.\nLastly, the failure of sanctions has led to the possibility of a world war in the future. Imposing sanctions is often cited as a peaceful way to bring nations to heel, to gradually force compliance with international standards, and to prevent the outbreak of conflict. Yet, despite the efforts of the international community to impose crippling sanctions on countries, they have not achieved the desired results. Iran, for example, continued its nuclear development in the face of crippling economic sanctions, pushing the envelope before the signing of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in 2015. Sanctions also resulted in the North Korean regime becoming more belligerent in its nuclear weapons program. Such attempts show that sanctions are merely a band-aid solution; they often lead to a tit-for-tat response that could eventually result in the escalation of violence. If economic and diplomatic sanctions are indeed effective, countries would have no reason to be involved in a world war. The inability of the international community to devise an effective way to handle these issues is alarming, and the possibility of a world war in the future cannot be discounted.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that while soft power may help reduce conflicts and tensions, it may not be enough to prevent a world war in the future due to the failure of sanctions, the irresistible allure of nuclear weapons, nationalistic desires for dominance and the inevitable competition that comes along with it to gain an upper hand. As citizens of the world, we need to be vigilant and demand that our elected leaders put diplomacy first and concentrate on peaceful resolutions rather than aggressive tactics. Being proactive in keeping peace by promoting dialogue, creating alliances and diplomatic channels is the best counter to the possibility of a world war. The best recognition would be to carry out concrete action towards promoting peace rather than merely entertaining the thought of a world war."

            "prompt": "IS THERE STILL PRIVACY IN TODAY\"S WORLD ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NEED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "d about their privacy, governments around the world have also realised their onus to set up laws to protect the privacy of their citizens. In this day and age where technology allows personal information to be easily accessed by others, many nations worldwide have agreed that privacy is a right that should be granted to all people and that individuals should be allowed by law to defend this right. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations since 1966, has an article that protects privacy, which states that \"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence\". It also grants everyone the right to be protected by law against any such interference. As such, this treaty acknowledges that there should be regulations set in place to defend the personal information of individuals. To date, 168 states have agreed to the treaty, and have in turn established their own legislations to protect the privacy of their citizens. In Singapore, for instance, the Protection of Private Data Act was enforced in 2013 for this very purpose. It can be seen that privacy still exists in today'sworld with the protection of personal information through the help of laws and regulations set up by governments.\nMoreover, in an increasingly democratic world, the political privacy of ordinary citizens is especially important in ensuring fair and unbiased voting so that they are protected against intimidation by electoral candidates. As more and more nations begin to adopt the voting system in government elections, political privacy is an increasingly pertinent right for all citizens, as candidates voted into parliament are expected to serve all citizens equally, without any bias towards those in favour of them or discrimination against people who voted against them. This is only possible if the choices of individual voters are kept secret. A case in point would be my society, Singapore, where polling stations for elections are set up with individual booths where voters are given their own space to mark their ballot paper. One is also advised to keep his vote a secret. This is also the case for many countries worldwide. Hence, privacy still exists as citizens are able to keep their political choices secret and unknown by other people.\nAll in all, despite privacy being a lawful right and having various means to protect it, it is an undeniable reality that people enjoy less privacy today than in the past, with technology that can potentially allow personal information to be disclosed to various organisations clandestinely, even if for grounds such as national security. That said, it is too extreme to assert that privacy no longer exists in today'sworld even if it is increasingly harder to achieve.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "y may well be a luxury in some cases.\n\nIt can then be argued that access to our data for the sake of national security does infringe our fundamental human rights on privacy. The long term impact of such collections can lead to issues such as identity theft, invasion of personal privacy, and abuse of power. There is no better example of this than the headlines surrounding various State-sponsored cyber-attacks which exposed the personal data of thousands of citizens resulting in thefts and subsequent future breaches.\n\nFurthermore, the vulnerability of data to cyber-attacks is of great significance. A breach of data results in citizen's information being out in the open, not only to governments but to malicious hackers and criminal organizations as well - posing a double threat to national security. The risk is higher if the data is not correctly safeguarded; therefore, it's imperative to address the challenges of cybersecurity while regulating privacy issues.\n\nNonetheless, arguments can be made in support of the loss of privacy. The government's actions to prioritize national security over privacy rights are understandable, especially when it comes to matters that threaten the peace and security of the country. This need to safeguard one's nation trumps individual needs since national security issues are at the forefront of governments' actions, rather than individual needs. Thus, national security is paramount against privacy concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of privacy today must take into account not just the benefits but the inherent vulnerabilities that come with it. The world as we know it is developing too fast, and there exist threats that could undermine our very freedom and liberty. It is however necessary for Governments to have an ethical approach to balancing these concerns, with measures in place to prevent abuse of power while upholding privacy principles. A system that provides privacy while still allowing for effective law enforcement is possible. Therefore, it would require social responsibility on the part of individuals, corporations, governments, and societies worldwide to work collaboratively to find that balance and provide solutions that wouldn't compromise the right to privacy in any significant way.",

                "d about their privacy, there are still many instances where privacy remains protected. For example, in politics, there is political privacy where politicians and government officials have the right to keep certain matters confidential to protect the interests of the public and the state. A good example of this is when classified information is kept secret to prevent information leakage that could compromise national security. Additionally, laws have also been instituted in many countries to safeguard the privacy rights of citizens. For example, in Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) was established in 2012 to govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations in the private sector. The PDPA is designed to give individuals greater control over their personal data and to protect them from potential data breaches and misuse of their information. Therefore, it is clear that in such cases, privacy is still respected and protected.\nIn conclusion, as much as privacy has become a debatable issue in today's society, it is a matter of balancing personal rights and societal benefits. While the need for national security is important, privacy should not be completely sacrificed in the process. Rather, there is a need for a more efficient and effective system that would ensure that the government's efforts do not deprive people of their privacy. More importantly, there should be laws to ensure that privacy is respected and protected in all instances where it is necessary. As such, it is erroneous to claim that there is no more privacy in today'sworld.",
                "d about their privacy, it is important that privacy is not completely forsaken. For instance, political privacy is still maintained, as any leaks of delicate information or personal opinions can affect the image and credibility of any political figure, leading to disruptive consequences including loss of support and votes. An example in point is the former United States President, Bill Clinton, whose controversial sex scandal almost led to his impeachment. The laws and regulations that protect individuals' privacy rights also have an important role to play as well. With people desiring to keep their personal and financial information confidential, and employers and companies expected to act as trustworthy managers of such information, the increasing use of Personal Data Protection (PDP) laws around the world enablethe preservation of privacy in the workings of society. For instance, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) offers individuals the right to amend, transfer and delete their personal data, as well as obligating organisations to seek consent before collecting an individual's data. It also demands that companies take especial care of sensitive data such as religion, race and political affiliation, which may be targeted to create social and political divides. All these legal provisions ensure that privacy in the modern world is not given up altogether.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that personalprivacy is being challenged in the interests of national security, it is not accurate to claim that there is no more privacy in today'sworld. Although there is a greater need for governments and organisations to access personal data for issues of security, privacy laws do exist which help to safeguard personal information, and there are still instances where privacy is maintained, like in the realm of politics. It is therefore crucial that a balance be struck between privacy and security so that individuals have their personal information protected, whilst at the same time ensuring an adequate level of intelligence and security to enable a safe and prosperous society.",
                "d about their privacy, there still exist certain instances where privacy is held in high regard. For instance, there is political privacy where politicians are permitted to have private actions away from the public. This is especially vital for those who may be caught in scandals that could ruin a politician's image and career. Additionally, there are laws and policies to protect individuals' privacy rights in various countries. Singapore, for example, has the Personal Data Protection Act, which governs the use of personal data by organisations, ensuring that individuals' personal information is reasonably protected. Similarly, the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation strictly regulates the collection, storage and use of individuals' personal information. This demonstrates that privacy is inevitably valued and protected in various aspects of society.\nIn conclusion, while technology has reduced privacy in some areas of modern life, I firmly believe that privacy still exists in today'sworld. Even though the need for national security may be used as grounds for intruding into people'sprivacy, there are still other spheres of society where privacy remains of utmost importance. Therefore, even though privacy may be limited in certain aspects, it is still a fundamental right protected by laws and regulations.",
                "d about their personal information being compromised, there are still instances where privacy is essential. Political privacy stands out as one key area. For example, when individuals participate in elections, they would naturally expect their voting preferences to be kept confidential. Doing so aids in preventing voter manipulation and coercion by parties, and encourages the expression of opinions without fear of being targeted. Additionally, many countries have laws that protect privacy rights of citizens. In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) protects citizens' personal data privacy by requiring entities to obtain explicit consent before collecting and storing data. It also provides consumers certain rights to access and delete their data. The US also has the Privacy Act that safeguards personal data held by federal agencies, while the Personal Data Protection Law in Singapore seeks to protect individuals' personal data held by private entities. All these examples attest that privacy still exists to a great extent.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that privacy may sometimes have to be sacrificed for the sake of national security, it is erroneous to claim that there is no more privacy in today's world. There are still various areas where privacy is necessary and protected by laws. Privacy and security can coexist, as long as there are appropriate measures in place to ensure that the necessary exchange of information is carried out in an ethical and legal manner.The challenge is to ensure that the balance between personal privacy and national security is maintained, while respecting individual rights.",
                "d about privacy, there are still avenues where individuals can exercise their right to privacy. One such avenue is political privacy. Politicians around the world are still able to keep certain personal information away from the public eye. For instance, despite the frequent opposition to him, Donald Trump managed to keep his tax records undisclosed for many years. There are also laws in place to protect citizens' privacy rights. For example, in Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act requires organisations to obtain consent before collecting or disclosing personal information. Additionally, individuals are allowed to request organisations to delete their personal information from their database. This has allowed Singaporeans to take greater control over their personal information and enhance their privacy rights.\nIn conclusion, while the need for national security may require governments to intrude into citizens'privacy, it is untrue to say that there is no more privacy in today's world. In situations where personal information is being collected for counterterrorism, privacy is indeed being encroached upon, but there are also instances where people, especially politicians, are still able to keep their personal information away from the public eye. Additionally, there are laws in place to protect citizens' privacy rights, allowing for greater control over their personal data. Therefore, instead of completely sacrificing privacy in pursuit of national security, a balance between the two should be struck to ensure enhanced security without compromising personal rights.",
                "d about their privacy, there are still instances where privacy remains highly valued and protected. Political privacy, for instance, remains an important aspect of privacy. Leaders of a country need privacy to engage in diplomatic discussions and negotiate treaties with other countries. Secrecy is required to avoid unnecessary interference and public opposition. Any leaks of private information could cause incalculable damage to international relations. In addition, there are laws designed to protect the privacy rights of citizens. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enacted by the European Union protects the privacy of EU citizens by preventing companies from collecting, processing, and storing their personal data without their knowledge or consent. In Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is a similar legal framework to protect the privacy of individuals. Hence, it is evident that privacy still exists in several domains such as politics and personal data protection.\nIn conclusion, while the need for national security has compelled governments to collect and analyse information on citizens, privacy still exists in crucial domains of society. As much as it is important to ensure national security for the safety of citizens, it is equally important to protect individual privacy. With the legal frameworks that exist, there is still a chance to preserve privacy for citizens. Nevertheless, the issue of privacy will continue to remain increasingly complex and will require businesses and governments to evolve continually to balance the need to protect the privacy of citizens and enhance security measures.",
                "d about their personal rights, there are still many instances where privacy still exists. Political privacy is one example. Political privacy is the ability to keep one's political views and affiliations private from others. Even in societies where political freedoms are limited, people feel a sense of privacy in sharing their political views with like-minded individuals. The recent Hong Kong protests are a clear example where privacy has been maintained by individuals despite the government's attempts to curb their freedom of expression. In addition, many countries have laws that protect individuals' privacy rights, such as the Personal Data Protection Act in Singapore that requires organisations to obtain clear consent before collecting and using personal information. Individuals also have the right to access their own personal data under this Act. These laws serve as a safeguard to maintain privacy in an increasingly data-driven world.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that there are increasing demands on the need to intrude into privacy in today's world for the sake of national security, it is erroneous to claim that there is no more privacy at all. Rather, there are still instances where individuals are able to maintain their privacy such as in political privacy and with legislation designed to protect individual privacy rights. The intrinsic human need for privacy as a basic personal right must always be preserved while balancing the needs of national security and safety.",
                "d about their privacy, there are still some instances where privacy can be preserved. One notable case of political privacy was the release of a private conversation between the Russian Ambassador to the US and former US National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. This conversation was only leaked out to the media after Flynn's resignation and created a furor as to whether the conversation had been illegally recorded or not. Similarly, privacy rights for citizens are safeguarded through several laws such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which was implemented by the European Union in 2018. The GDPR sets out rules governing personal data that is collected by organisations, companies and institutions for purposes of processing or transferring data outside the EU. The GDPR has given citizens the power to access their personal information or request that it be deleted. This has given them some measure of control over the use of their personal data and has ensured that some level of privacy is maintained.\nIn conclusion, while it may seem that privacy is a rapidly disappearing concept in today's world, there remains some instances where it can still be preserved. However, national security is a pressing issue, given the current times, and at times, personal privacy may need to be sacrificed for the greater good. That said, it is important for governments to find a balance between protecting their citizens from harm and preserving personal privacy rights, so that there is no undue intrusion into the private lives of individuals.",
                "d about digital privacy, it is important to note that privacy still exists in several other areas. For instance, there is the right to political privacy which allows individuals to vote for their preferred political candidates without any interference or influence. This ensures that individuals do not face any intimidation or reprisal from those who oppose their choices. Additionally, societal views and values can also affect one'sprivacy. Examples include individual choices such as those associated with religion and sexuality. As a result, governments have created laws that protect an individual's privacy rights and ensure that they are not infringed upon. In Singapore, the Personal Data Protection Act ensures that organisations that collect personal data abide by the rules of data protection and prevents the sharing of an individual\u2019s data without their consent. Such regulations and policies thus ensure that privacy remains an essential human right and it is not entirely lost in today's world.\nIn conclusion, the issue of privacy is one that is increasingly growing in significance in today's world. While governments are expected to ensure national security, their efforts should also make an allowance for individual privacy rights through the adoption of measures that ensure balance between both. It is, therefore, imperative that individuals become aware of their privacy rights and understand how their personal information can be used under different circumstances. Only through this awareness can we ensure that a balance is struck between privacy and national security, and that privacy will continue to exist in today's world.",
                "d about their personal information being at risk, there are still instances where privacy is respected and protected. One example is the concept of political privacy which refers to the protection of an individual's political beliefs, opinions and affiliations from being exposed and used against them. Political privacy is essential for democratic nations as it allows individuals the freedom to express their views without fear of repercussions or discrimination. For example, in Singapore, the Political Donations Act requires political parties to maintain the confidentiality of their donors. This law protects donors' privacy by preventing their political contributions from being publicly disclosed and used to disadvantage them.\nAnother way in which privacy is still being protected is through laws such as the Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) which regulates the collection, use and disclosure of personal data by organisations. The PDPA grants individuals the right to access and correct their personal data, as well as to withdraw consent for their data to be used or disclosed. The act also imposes penalties and fines on organisations that breach its provisions. Such laws serve to safeguard individuals' privacy rights and ensure that their personal data is not used for purposes they did not consent to.\nIn conclusion, while the need for national security has led to intrusions into personal privacy, it is erroneous to claim that privacy no longer exists in today's world. There are still instances where privacy is respected and protected, such as in political privacy and laws to safeguard privacy rights. Protecting privacy in an increasingly digitised world is a challenge that requires a balance between national security and individual rights. Ultimately, it is up to society to determine the extent to which privacy can be encroached upon for the greater good, while ensuring that individuals' rights are not unduly infringed upon."

It is possible to achieve both privacy and national security if carried out ethically and cautiously. Therefore, there must be effective oversight mechanisms to regulate the handling of private data. This includes implementing laws that restrict unlawful access and usage of personal data by government institutions or private corporations without the citizen's consent. There must also be transparency in the collection, storage, and sharing of personal data, with active participation from the citizens, to ensure that they can trust the government's measures.\n\nIn conclusion, in today's world, national security and privacy are two concepts that are often at odds. While national security is important and necessary, it should not be achieved at the expense of privacy rights.

These entities routinely collect personal data, and often misuse them for their own purposes, like targeted marketing and ads. Recently, the Cambridge Analytica scandal in which Facebook user data was collected and used to influence the 2016 US presidential election, opened the eyes of the public to how easily personal data can be exploited for nefarious purposes.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of privacy is a complex one in today's world. The need for national security and public health measures has inevitably led to some infringements on our privacy rights. While governments must take necessary steps to safeguard their citizens, they also have a responsibility to ensure that their citizens' rights to privacy are not entirely overridden. A balance between protecting individual freedoms and safeguarding national or public interests must be struck, and the ethical usage of citizen's data should be central to this approach.",

            "prompt": "\"FOREIGN AID DOES NOT SOLVE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.\" TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS A FAIR VIEWPOINT?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "whole, whether foreign aid works thus lies in whether they are funding a country with strong institutions with potential for growth, or feeding one that is corrupted. David Cameron said that it is not really about the quantity of aid but rather what he terms as the \"golden thread\", which is whether the country has stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law and transparent information. It is when these institutions are in place, that the dollars can make sense.\nNonetheless, donor countries also have the responsibility to consider carefully how they disburse their aid. Unfortunately, the pattern of giving has been one of fragmentation. Donor countries want to seem as generous as possible, so they give to many countries, but in small amounts. This leads to aid coming from more directions but in smaller amounts. In 2013, the average project funded by aid was worth $1.9 million in 2013, down from $5.3 million in 2000. In Mozambique, it has 27 donors in the field of health alone, but some countries each give less than $1 million. This kind of fragmentation reduces the efficiency of aid, because they require civil servants to manage and oversee, increasing the amount of bureaucracy while having less economies of scale in terms of impact.\nAnother problem with foreign aid is also how donor countries decide to give. Long term problems require long term aid, but countries often fluctuate in their level of support, withdrawing support just when developing countries begin to gain traction. Researchers have found that donors tend to prefer short term projects with measurable results, a demand which aid agencies are thus inclined to meet. Thus, aid has been largely successful in building schools, infrastructure, which are tangible with straightforward benefits and timeline. However, they are not able to build strong institutions, which as discussed previously are more important.\nLastly, aid is often conditional, with donor countries threatening to withdraw them if their demands are not met. Aid is after all, not as altruistic and humanitarian as it is made out to be. Developed countries use aid to promote their interests and ideologies. For example, the UK gives more aid to Pakistan, Syria, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Afghanistan, countries which are not the poorest, but rather where the UK wishes to influence politically whether because they have a dictator or where radical Islam is taking root. Other than political ideology, developed countries also use aid to benefit themselves economically, in the form of tied aid, where aid is used to purchase items from the giving country itself. For example, close to 80% of the US Agency for International Development'scontracts and grants go directly to American firms. Sometimes, aid is given as loans, which only leads to debt accumulation. Thus, aid can reproduce existing inequalities between countries instead of helping them solve long-term problems.\nTo sum up, there are many barriers in the real world which have led to foreign aid not being able to solve long term problems. This is primarily because they are not the key to solving them, but rather a possible resource to do so. In order to solve long term problems, there is indeed, no single panacea or silver bullet.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "in unachieved.\n\nAdditionally, foreign aid can destabilize the domestic market of a recipient country, making it difficult for local businesses to thrive. For instance, foreign aid could lead to the saturation of the local market with subsidized goods from other countries, leading to the collapse of local businesses that cannot compete with the lower prices. These local businesses need to grow to succeed, but with foreign intervention, they have very little room for development and innovation. \n\nAnother challenge of foreign aid is the risk of it being lost to corruption. In many cases, foreign aid ends up in the hands of governments and bureaucrats, rather than the intended recipients. In some cases, the funds are diverted to personal bank accounts overseas, leaving those in need without assistance. The remarkable lack of accountability can lead to a vicious cycle, where governments and bureaucrats become reliant on foreign aid, and the people that are supposed to receive these funds remain stuck in poverty.\n\nLastly, foreign aid programs often fail to incorporate the cultural and social traditions of the communities that they target. In many cases, these programs are designed by external entities without any understanding of the cultural differences, social networks, and leadership structures of the people they are trying to help. Consequently, these intervention programs may be rejected, which can lead to the underutilization of the aid. Even if the program is utilized, it may not address the social and cultural problems of the community, rendering it ineffective in the long run. \n\nIn conclusion, the idea that foreign aid is not a long-term solution to poverty is valid to some extent. While it can provide immediate relief, stimulate economic growth, and promote development, it can also foster dependency culture, disrupt the domestic market, erode governance standards, and fail to incorporate the cultural-sensitive approach needed in addressing social issues. Therefore, for foreign aid to be effective, it should be designed carefully to provide targeted assistance, foster self-reliance instead of dependency, provide accountability, and be culturally sensitive.",

One potential reason why foreign aid may struggle to be effective has to do with the way it is utilised and managed in the countries of destination. Corruption, bureaucracy, and mismanagement can all hinder the effective distribution of aid, reducing its impact. Moreover, aid can sometimes be given with strings attached or be subject to conditionalities, such as requiring countries to adhere to certain policies or practices. This can lead to a divergence in priorities between the donor countries and the recipient countries, ultimately reducing its effectiveness.\n\nIn conclusion, while foreign aid has been successful in some cases, it is not a panacea for all development issues. The effectiveness of foreign aid in solving long-term problems is contingent upon a range of factors, including distribution, management, and intent. Ultimately, foreign aid should be seen as a complement to, rather than a replacement for, other development efforts, such as trade and investment.",

Countries such as Ghana and Burkina Faso received large foreign financial flows in the 1990s, and their economic growth improved in the following years. Moreover, aid has been able to help countries during emergency situations such as natural disasters, where timely aid has been the difference between life and death for many.\nOverall, it is a fair view to say that foreign aid does not always solve long-term problems, and in some cases, it may even do more harm than good. However, there are many factors at play, and ultimately, aid is not a one-size-fits-all solution. A more nuanced approach to aid giving, which takes into account the needs of the recipient country, is likely to be more effective in solving long-term problems. Nevertheless, it is important to continue to provide aid, as it remains an essential tool to help those in need, improve quality of life, and contribute to global prosperity.",

Governments can channel the aid towards areas that are not necessarily the most pressing, effective or efficient. Additionally, corruption and waste have been known to plague the distribution of aid, rendering it ineffective. In this sense, it would be unfair to completely dismiss aid as a solution to long term problems. Ultimately, it is important to note that foreign aid is not a panacea for all of the world's problems. There are many factors that influence a country's development, including its own policies and the international economic and political environment. While foreign aid can be a helpful tool for development, it cannot be relied upon as the sole solution to long term problems. Instead, a comprehensive approach towards development that takes into account the needs and capacities of the recipient country is necessary for true and sustainable progress.",
                "other hand, it must also be noted that foreign aid is often given with good intentions and is much needed by developing countries. Its failure to solve long-term problems could also be attributed to the way the aid is utilised and managed by countries of destination. Corruption is often rampant in developing countries, where huge sums of aid money are often mismanaged or siphoned off by corrupt officials. For instance, Ghana\u2019s chief justice was sacked and 34 other judges investigated in a bribery scandal in 2015. Zimbabwe's first lady even allegedly assaulted a model in South Africa in 2017 while supposedly shopping for luxury goods with aid money. Therefore, while it is easy to criticise foreign aid for its inability to solve long-term problems, recipients of aid also bear some responsibility to ensure that the aid received is well-utilised for the greater good of their countries.\nTo conclude, while there are instances where foreign aid is successful in solving long-term problems, it is undeniable that there are also cases where it has failed due to a variety of reasons such as corruption and mismanagement. In order for foreign aid to be more effective in solving long-term problems, there needs to be a concerted effort from both countries that give and receive aid to ensure that aid is utilised in the best possible manner. Ultimately, developing countries need to take charge of their own development to ensure a sustainable future, with foreign aid acting as a complementing force rather than a substitute.",
                "other hand, it is important to note that the failure of foreign aid to solve long-term problems is not necessarily due to its inherent flaws, but rather due to the systemic issues it faces. Corruption, mismanagement, failed governance and bureaucracy all serve as obstacles to the effective distribution and implementation of aid. For instance, in many cases, recipient countries have diverted aid to other purposes than its intended objectives. It has also been pointed out that the conditions applied to aid have often been too lenient, with no guarantee that the funds will be used effectively. Given these systemic issues, it is clear that simply throwing more money at the problem may not always be effective, and alternative solutions must be sought.\nIn conclusion, the statement \"foreign aid does not solve long-term problems\" is not entirely fair, as there have been instances where it has worked, such as in health-related issues. However, it is true that foreign aid has not been able to solve long-term issues to the extent that it was hoped for. Its effectiveness has been limited, especially when it comes to the development of countries and their economies. The reasons for this are complex and multifaceted, with systemic and governance problems being major stumbling blocks. To make foreign aid work more effectively, we need to address these issues and rethink the way we deliver aid, with greater emphasis on transparency and accountability to ensure that aid reaches those who need it the most.",
                "other hand, there is also the issue of how the aid is managed and utilised by countries of destination. Corruption is a major issue, to the extent that BBC reported that between 20 and 40% of aid is lost to corruption. As a result, the aid does not reach the intended beneficiaries, and the problems it was meant to solve persist. In addition, foreign aid has been criticised for creating a dependency culture, which discourages countries from exerting their own effort to develop their economies and improve the lives of their people. This, in turn, makes it less likely for the long-term issues to be resolved.\n\nIn conclusion, it is fair to say that foreign aid does not always solve long-term problems. While there are cases where it has successfully tackled such issues, there are also instances where aid has either been unproductive or even counterproductive. Factors such as the way aid is managed, corruption, dependency cultures, and intent and pattern of giving all play a crucial role in determining the effectiveness of foreign aid. Therefore, it is imperative for countries and international organisations to evaluate their strategies and methods of offering aid, to ensure that it is being directed towards the right places.",
                "other hand, it is also important to highlight the issue of aid effectiveness. In many cases, aid may not solve long-term problems because of the way it is utilised and managed by the countries of destination. Aid dependency can lead to a lack of accountability and ineffective governance, where countries become reliant on aid rather than working towards self-sufficiency and sustainable growth. Additionally, aid may sometimes come with conditions or be tied to a country's political agenda, which can limit the flexibility of the receiver to use the aid in a way that would benefit their country in the long run.\nIn conclusion, it is fair to say that while foreign aid can solve long-term problems, it is not always successful in doing so. Its effectiveness largely depends on how it is managed and utilised by the countries of destination, as well as the intent and pattern of giving from the countries of origin. Aid can be a valuable resource, but it should be accompanied by efforts towards self-sufficiency and long-term sustainable growth, rather than just a quick fix. Ultimately, it is a complex issue that requires careful consideration and evaluation of the impact of aid on the ground.",
                "other hand, the intended usage and management of aid can also be a determining factor in the success or failure in solving long-term problems. Some countries that receive foreign aid have issues of corruption and mismanagement, leading to aid not reaching its intended beneficiaries. For example, in Nigeria, a country that receives substantial amounts of aid, corruption has seen little progress despite billions being invested. The problem is exacerbated in situations where aid is given without proper consultation with or participation from local communities. This results in projects that do not align with the needs of locals and are prone to failure.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \u201cforeign aid does not solve long-term problems\u201d is partly fair. While foreign aid has helped in solving long-term problems, it is not a guarantee. It requires a lot of factors to play out well to achieve success. Also, the success of foreign aid depends on the cause one is seeking to address and the management of the aid itself. The situation in each country differs, and so does the effectiveness of the foreign aid received. Ultimately, a more holistic approach that factors in the needs and input of local communities is vital in achieving long-term success through foreign aid.",
                "other hand, it is unfair to label all foreign aid as ineffective. The problem lies in the way foreign aid is being managed and utilised by the governments of recipient countries, as well as the intent behind the giving of aid by the countries of origin.

This can create a cycle of dependency, where recipient countries become reliant on foreign aid rather than developing sustainable solutions for their own development problems. Additionally, corruption and mismanagement can result in aid not reaching its intended recipients, or being diverted for other purposes, further hindering long-term development.\n\nTherefore, while it may be unfair to view all foreign aid as ineffective in solving long-term problems, there is certainly a need to review the current system of foreign aid and ensure that aid is being utilised in ways that promote sustainable development. More emphasis could be placed on fostering partnerships and collaborations with recipient countries, ensuring transparency and accountability in the management of aid, and ensuring that aid is being used to address the root causes of development problems rather than just providing short-term relief.

            "human_gen_truncate": ", pressure when imposed on oneself over prolonged periods of time can make one unhappy, as it can lead to both physical toil and mental turmoil. Science has shown that prolonged pressure can lead to symptoms like migraines and headaches which impede functioning, as well as well-being. It has effects on nearly every part of the body, from causing gastrointestinal disorders to endocrine malfunctioning. Unexplained disorders are thus often a result of stress. For example, athletes who are pressured may force themselves to train way harder than they actually want to, making them fatigued and ironically, able to perform less than optimally, setting themselves up for a vicious cycle as they then try to train even harder to make up for it. People may tell themselves that they are never good enough, which in suitable doses makes one work harder. However, if one continually subjects oneself to such criticism whether by themselves or by others, they are setting themselves up for lower self-esteem. The pressure thus causes people to break because regardless of how much they work, they never think they can succeed. This is the basis of the best-selling book \"Secret\", which encourages readers to do the opposite and believe in themselves instead of being overcome by pressure.\nPressure can also cause unhappiness when they make goals the end in itself.  Ultimately, this can even lead them to think of success as something they must have, rather than a desirable goal. The difference between the two is that the former will make people tie their self-worth and their entire world to whether they succeed or not. This is so true for many students who are extremely pressured by expectations arising from themselves, teachers or parents that they must perform well for their exams, believing that any other outcomes are construed as failures. Stories of young children committing suicide after scoring poorly for exams in Singapore are unfortunate examples of how pressure can be toxic.\nFinally, we must also take into consideration the fact that different people have different capacities for pressure. While some enjoy the adrenaline of pressure and perform well under it, others cannot cope with it and break under it. It is thus more important for people to identify for themselves when they are over the optimal threshold, when pressure switches from motivating force to a cause for unhappiness, and then apply strategies that work for them. Different people have different strategies to deal with it: some people will take a break from what they are pressured by, such as by playing recreational sports or engaging in their hobbies while others require the support of family and close ones.\nIn conclusion, whether pressure is a motivating force or a cause for unhappiness depends on why one is experiencing pressure, and how one experiences it.

            "human_gen_truncate": "he government, the Gini coefficient is relatively high at 0.41, suggesting that the efforts of governments alone are insufficient. Besides direct government transfers, governments have to prioritise when devoting resources to agencies helping different social groups, hence making an inclusive society a chimeric fantasy.\nFurthermore, eradicating income inequality and the inequality of opportunities require an overhaul of the capitalist system of Western nations and the global economy, which is simply quixotic and unrealistic. The free movement of labour, goods and capital across national borders along with rapid technological advancement means that technically able, high-skilled workers tend to command higher wages, while low-skilled manual workers are easily displaced by an influx of workers from less developed countries. Inequality has risen drastically across the world, in both developing and developed countries as a result: in Brazil, the top 1% accounts for 25% of national income; in Russia, the income share of the top 1% of the population increased from 4% in 1980 to 20% in 2015. Likewise, in India, that figure rose from 6% in 1982 to 22% in 2013 and in China, it surged from 6% in 1978 to 14% in 2015. Compound this with the fact that the rich tend to pass on financial and social privileges to their offspring, and inequality is entangled with decreasing levels of social mobility. This suggests that attempts to create an inclusive society have to take into account the overarching societal framework which we operate in, and a total overhaul of it seems implausible. Even in countries which adopt alternative models such as communism, there is often skyrocketing inequality as well. Even though communist countries like the Soviet Union managed to reduce income inequality to unprecedented levels, it did so by reducing the size of the pie for everyone, and displacing existing capitalist structures with other hierarchies that disadvantaged the poor and the unfortunate. It appears that in the current context, achieving an inclusive society might just be an ideal, at best.\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that the above arguments rest on the assumption that an inclusive society is desirable; it well may not be, indeed. Many argue that an inclusive society where diversity is celebrated and not resented is a more tolerant, pleasant one to live in, and allows individuals of varied talents to live up to their true potential. If Singapore had not created a space for entrepreneurship, or encouraged its students to deviate from traditional models of success, the likes of Carousell, honestbee and ViSenze would not have existed. That said, however, efforts to make society more inclusive might conflict with the need to be factually accurate. For instance, sporting authorities in the Western world have permitted the participation of transsexual individuals in sporting events, as societies become more progressive and inclusive over time. However, critics often cite the unfair advantage that pre-transition transgender athletes have over biological females, which is ignored when transgender athletes are allowed to participate as females, as an example of \"inclusivity\" being taken to the extreme, to the extent that reality is wilfully distorted.\nBy and large, an inclusive society is desirable and pleasant to live in, as it maximises human potential, if it is created or done in moderation. However, because there are finite resources for an infinite number of social groups clamouring to be included, the reality is that achieving an inclusive society can only remain a pipe dream for now.",

In Greta Thunberg's speech at the United Nations, she rightfully pointed out that the exploitation of minorities and marginalization of the poor is one of the leading contributors to climate change. Employment opportunities provide these marginalized individuals a way to earn a livelihood that is otherwise difficult for them to.\n\nBesides, promoting inclusivity in various aspects of life can enhance social cohesion, thus creating stronger communities. Social cohesion is a state that fosters unity, understanding, and cooperation among different groups in a society. When different groups can come together and work towards a shared goal, it leads to a more conducive environment and better opportunities for everyone. Social cohesion can be enhanced by the government and community leaders by organizing events and initiatives that break down barriers and promote inclusivity. For instance, in Singapore, the government organizes community events such as the National Day celebrations and communal gatherings, which promote social cohesion by bringing people from different backgrounds together to share their cultures and experiences.\n\nDespite the various ways in which an inclusive society can be achieved, it is worth acknowledging that this may not always be an easy task. Different factors may pose challenges that may complicate the process of attaining an inclusive society. One such factor is profound prejudices that define the behavior of individuals in the society. Prejudices can often be deep-seated and difficult to eradicate, making it hard for individuals to work towards creating a more inclusive society. For instance, in most parts of the world, there is still discrimination against marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and refugees.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my view that achieving an inclusive society is desirable and achievable. Although there are challenges that may hinder the process, it is important to acknowledge the potential benefits of promoting inclusiveness such as better social cohesion, stronger communities, and a more conducive environment for everyone. Governments, organizations, individuals, and communities should work together towards creating a more inclusive society by encouraging educational initiatives, promoting equal employment opportunities, and promoting social cohesion through community events.

This suggests that achieving an inclusive society which benefits all its members might indeed be an unrealistic goal.\nAn additional reason why an inclusive society might be unrealistic is that achieving it requires a complete overhaul of the ways in which capitalist economies and the international economy work. The current neoliberal model, which emphasizes free-market competition and minimal government regulation, makes it difficult for governments to implement policies which benefit all groups in society. This is because the interests of different stakeholders may differ, and governments may be seen to unfairly favour certain groups over others. In addition, the dynamics of the international economy make it difficult for individual governments to enact policies which take into account the needs of all members of society. As such, achieving an inclusive society may indeed seem like an unrealistic dream in today's world.\n\nIn conclusion, achieving an inclusive society is certainly a desirable goal, as it promotes equality and diversity, and allows all members of society to thrive. However, the realities of finite resources, the inadequacy of current measures and policies to promote inclusivity, and the difficulty of reforming the existing economic-political systems, point towards the conclusion that achieving an inclusive society is indeed an unrealistic goal.

This suggests that achieving an inclusive society where everyone benefits may indeed be an unrealistic goal.\nFurthermore, achieving an inclusive society requires an overhaul of the ways in which the Western capitalist economy and the international economy function. In today's context, multinational corporations tend to focus on cost-saving measures and seek to maximise their profits. This inevitably results in a scenario where workers who are low-skilled or unable to recognise their worth in the job market are left behind. This can be seen in the case of companies like Uber and Deliveroo, which hire gig workers in a race to the bottom in terms of wages. Such companies have enabled a massive transfer of wealth from their workforce to their owners, with the latter making billions of dollars per annum while denying their workers adequate pay and benefits. The international economy, moreover, perpetuates this inequality through the exploitation of cheap labour in developing nations, where workers are deprived of their basic rights in favour of their bosses pursuing greater profits. Achieving an inclusive society requires the development of alternative economic models that prioritise workers' rights and welfare over profit-making.\nIn conclusion, achieving an inclusive society is indeed a desirable goal, but it is an unrealistic one given the constraints of finite resources, existing policies that inadvertently emphasise differences between groups, and the need for an overhaul of our current economic structures. Nonetheless, while it may be impossible to achieve perfect inclusiveness, we can still take steps towards making our society more tolerant and accepting.

The existence of finite resources, existing measures that emphasize differences between individuals, and the inherent difficulties of balancing the needs of different social groups make it a challenging task. However, it is important for societies to continue striving towards greater inclusivity regardless, as it creates a more tolerant and harmonious environment for all.

This suggests that while an inclusive society is a desirable goal, it is one that is likely unachievable as long as we continue to operate within the current economic system.\nFinally, it is important to remember that achieving an inclusive society demands a holistic approach which seeks to dismantle the structures which exclude others. However, doing so involves more than just symbolic gestures and requires significant political and social transformation. It calls for a dismantling of the existing structures which promote inequality and biases, which is likely to be a long and slow process. Moreover, there needs to be greater recognition of the role of individuals in this process. An inclusive society requires not only political will at the top but also a social awareness that embracing diversity and inclusivity is not only desirable but necessary for a better future.\nIn conclusion, achieving an inclusive society is an admirable goal, but one that is likely unrealistic given the current systems and structures which undergird our social institutions. Nevertheless, it should not deter us from pursuing policies which promote greater social equality, tolerance and inclusivity. It highlights the need for a fundamental overhaul in our ways of thinking and concerns and one which necessitates recognizing the role of every institution in accomplishing this goal.",

It appears that while we strive for an inclusive society, the feasibility of such a goal remains unrealistic.\n\nFinally, efforts to create an inclusive society can conflict with the importance of being factually accurate. For example, affirmative action programmes to make education more accessible for marginalized communities may be seen as unfairly skewing the educational system. Merit-based admissions criteria may appear discriminatory, but it is imperative that admission to educational institutions take into account individual aptitude, abilities and past accomplishments. Likewise, there have been debates surrounding language policies which have been used to promote a certain cultural ethos. Such policies may be seen as prioritising national interests over the needs and desires of individuals' right to mother-tongue language and cultural tradition. These conflicts highlight the intrinsic problem in creating an inclusive society - that sometimes it may be necessary to make hard decisions that not everyone agrees with.\n\nIn conclusion, while the notion of an inclusive society is certainly an attractive one and deserves to be celebrated, it is an idealistic end which policymakers and all of society can never fully achieve. Nonetheless, it is crucial we strive to be inclusive; we need to learn to accept differences, acknowledge the variety in people's experiences and respect every individual as a valuable member of society. While we may not be able to achieve absolute inclusivity, continued steps toward acceptance and tolerance should be taken to create a happier, equitable and a more harmonious society.",
                "he government, the Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, remains relatively high at 0.458. This suggests that while it is desirable to aim for an inclusive society, it is unrealistic to expect the complete eradication of inequality.\nFurthermore, achieving an inclusive society also requires changes in the way capitalist economies function. Critics argue that the current system prioritises profit over people, resulting in exploitation of workers, environmental degradation and inequality. Calls for fairer wealth distribution and a reconsideration of the role of corporations in society have been made, but implementation of such changes would require a fundamental overhaul of the economic system. Governments prioritise growth and corporate interests over societal ones, favouring corporate tax cuts and subsidies over welfare for the needy. This is perpetuated by the neoliberal capitalist economic system, which prioritises individualism and competition over collectivism and cooperation. For an inclusive society to be truly realised, this system and its values have to be challenged, which is a monumental task.\nIn conclusion, creating an inclusive society is no doubt a desirable goal, but unrealistic if we do not acknowledge the limitations of current measures, the need to recognise the differences between individuals, and an unwillingness to challenge the current economic system. It is incumbent on us to continue striving towards creating a more inclusive society, but we must also accept that this may take a long time, if not be an impossible goal, to achieve.",
                "he state, income inequality remains stubbornly high. This suggests that achieving an inclusive society is not merely a matter of redistributing wealth or resources but rather a rethinking of the way in which societies structure themselves around power dynamics. Thus, achieving an inclusive society may be desirable, but remains elusive in current circumstances.\nFinally, the need to be factually accurate also makes the goal of achieving an inclusive society unrealistic. This is because individuals are biologically different from one another, with different intellectual and physical abilities. This raises the question of how far society should go in enabling individuals who have difficulty adapting to society to integrate themselves. For instance, proponents of affirmative action argue that such policies help to level the playing field for disadvantaged groups, by taking into account their socio-economic and educational background. However, opponents argue that affirmative action results in reverse discrimination against the more qualified candidates. Indeed, while much progress has been made in reducing systemic barriers, it is unlikely that society can ever completely eliminate the existence of differences between individuals. The goal of inclusion thus clashes with the need to be factually accurate.\nIn sum, while an inclusive society is certainly an ideal worth striving for, it remains an unrealistic goal given the systemic barriers in place that serve to emphasise differences between individuals, finite resources for an infinite number of groups, and the need to be factually accurate. Nonetheless, despite the difficulties in achieving an inclusive society, it is crucial for societies to attempt to do so in order to promote greater equality, tolerance and diversity, so that all individuals, regardless of differences, can achieve their potential and contribute meaningfully to society.",

Existing measures to promote inclusivity often emphasize differences between individuals and groups, and may even lead to unintended consequences such as increased discrimination towards certain groups. Additionally, the allocation of finite resources to an infinite number of groups makes it challenging for governments to ensure that all members of society benefit equally from progress.

                "he government, income inequality still persists; the richest 10% of households enjoy 35 times the income of the poorest 10%. Thus, it is apparent that for an inclusive society to materialise, we have to rethink and restructure the current socio-economic systems.\nFurthermore, globalisation has brought about global inequalities and created exploitation in many developing countries. The international economic system operates in such a manner that the powerful countries continue to exploit the weaker nations, resulting in an unequal distribution of wealth and resources. This inevitably leads to conditions that are detrimental to the inclusivity of society, as the benefits that accrue from such actions are not broadly shared among the population or between different countries. However, achieving a more equitable distribution of resources is difficult given how Western capitalist economies are critically dependent on the exploitation of wealth and resources of other countries. Hence, promoting an inclusive society requires an overhaul of the current international economic order.\nIn conclusion, an inclusive society is a noble and desirable goal, but the road to achieving such a society is littered with many obstacles that must first be overcome. While measures that promote diversity and equity in society have been put in place, we must continuously strive to create systems that create an equal distribution of wealth and resources so that an inclusive society can become a reality. Although the goal may seem unrealistic, it is imperative that we keep working towards the realisation of this vision because the benefits of an inclusive society are far-reaching.",

Achieving a truly inclusive society requires a rethinking of how resources are distributed and utilised, with a focus on the common good instead of just individual interests. However, given the practical constraints, it may be unrealistic to expect such a radical change in the status quo.\nIn conclusion, while the aspiration towards creating an inclusive society is admirable, the challenges and limitations to achieving such a society cannot be denied. The unrealistic expectations for complete equality, the need to be factually accurate, and finite resources are major hurdles to attaining an inclusive society. Nevertheless, it is important to keep striving towards this goal and continue to promote policies and measures that encourage the acceptance of diversity and promote social mobility for all."

            "human_gen_truncate": "mous athletes in the world, whether Michael Jordan with his own Nike line, or Cristiano Ronaldo (with 322 million social media followers) who also has a $1 billion Nike Contract and his own brand, CR7. However, local sporting athletes are not nearly as well known by the public. This is also due to an overall lack of interest in sports in general. During the early days of Singapore football when locals were more fired up by it, local footballers like Fandi Ahmad had many fans. However, attention to local leagues and competitions is no longer comparable to international level competitions whether in football or tennis. Without some level of recognition by society, sporting achievement by local athletes does not translate to fame and fortune, unlike in the case of other countries.\nHow sporting achievement is defined also determines how it is recognised in Singapore. The overall situation In Singapore when it comes to the recognition of sporting achievement is a polarised one. If one is not exceptionally talented and achieves incredible results such as in the case of Schooling, one is not recognised and duly rewarded, or even supported. This stems from Singapore'spragmatism in the measurement of sporting achievement. Athletes are ranked into different levels depending on their potential to represent Singapore at regional or national levels, and ultimately rewarded based on the medals they win. While this is not \"unfair\", it pegs recognition to results rather than to effort, which is often tremendous when it comes to the amount athletes have to put in, especially in view of the fact that they could be pursuing more lucrative careers. Coming back to the monetary grant by the government, the size of the amount shows how sporting achievement is not on the same level as say, an actual occupation, even though athletes spend the same, if not more, amount of time training.\nSporting achievement is also often tied to national interests, and thus some athletes who do well in sports internationally are not recognised. Ben Davis'sdeferral which was rejected by the Ministry of Defence was based on the idea that his career is a personal pursuit, rather than for national glory. Again, this pragmatic and calculative approach simplifies what sporting achievement can mean in Singapore. If the word \"Singapore\" is not tagged to the achievement, it seems that it is not considered worthy. While being able to represent one'scountry is also what most athletes probably have in mind, the relationship should also go both ways. In Davis'scase, instead of rejoicing in the fact that a Singaporean is playing in the UK leagues, it was framed that he was simply playing for his personal interest. Ironically, the government has spared no expenses in \"importing\" foreign talents for the sake of earning more medals based on this idea that sporting achievement is valuable because the Singaporean brand name is on it.\nOverall, it is a vicious cycle: athletes are recognised only if they are extremely successful, but there is no support for them because there is little hope that they will be. The safer route is and will probably always be to pursue academics and skills rather than to pursue sports, because sports brings neither monetary rewards nor fame to athletes in the case of Singapore, and therefore sadly, there is much truth in the essay questions that sporting achievement is not adequately rewarded or recognized in my country.",

Moreover, the limited opportunities for professional athletes in Singapore can also limit the recognition of sporting achievement. Unlike in other countries, where professional athletes are well-recognized and rewarded, many sports in Singapore remain amateur, which limits the extent to which sporting achievement can be recognized.\n\nFurthermore, there is a need for society to appreciate the different types of sporting achievements, not just those in national or international events. Singapore has a vibrant sporting culture, with many individuals participating in different sports intensively as amateurs. However, the achievement of these individuals is not well-recognized in society. For instance, a local runner who wins a marathon in Singapore may not receive the same recognition as someone who gets a bronze medal at the Olympics. This can lead to a perception that only nationally or internationally recognized sports events merit recognition, while other sporting achievements do not.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that Singapore has made significant progress in promoting sporting activities and recognizing sports achievement. However, there exist challenges in the recognition of sporting achievement due to factors such as an emphasis on academic excellence, the limited opportunities for professional athletes, and a lack of appreciation of different types of sporting achievements. To address these challenges, there is a need for society to develop a more holistic approach to the recognition of sports achievement, where both national and local sporting achievements are appreciated and celebrated.

The lack of priority given to sporting achievements from an early age, coupled with the lack of monetary rewards and public recognition, makes it difficult for athletes to pursue sports as a career. While steps have been taken to improve the situation, such as increasing funding for sports and establishing sports-related scholarships, more needs to be done to incentivize sporting achievement and develop a vibrant sports culture in Singapore society.

This reinforces the idea that sports are an extracurricular activity and not a significant aspect of one's character or ability.\n\nIn conclusion, while there has been progress in recognizing sporting achievement in Singapore, it still largely falls behind academic achievement in terms of priority and recognition.

This is in part due to the focus on academic achievement, the lack of monetary incentives, and the relatively low levels of engagement and interest in spectator sports.

For instance, amateur events or smaller competitions might receive little to no media coverage, leaving the athletes who participate in them with little reward or recognition for their hard work and dedication. This lack of recognition creates a significant disincentive to pursue a career in sports, as it is difficult for someone to get involved in a profession where they know they will receive little or no recognition or reward for their efforts. \n\nIn conclusion, while there have been some moves to give sporting achievements more recognition in Singapore, there is still much to be done. The current societal and economic pressures don't encourage recognition of sporting achievements as there is still a stronger focus placed on academic excellence around the country. To address this issue, the government might need to consider increasing the amount of support provided to sportsmen and women, as well as making it more enticing for businesses and media outlets to invest in brand-strengthening by collaborating with professional athletes.

While CEOs and doctors in Singapore can earn six-figure salaries or higher, professional athletes often earn significantly less. For example, the average salary of a Singapore professional footballer is $2,500 per month, which is less than what some entry-level jobs pay. This discourages many talented athletes from pursuing sports as a career, and thus limits the pool of athletes who can potentially represent Singapore in international competitions. \n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore does acknowledge and celebrate sports victories, sporting achievements are not given enough recognition in society as a whole.

While Singapore has made some strides, such as through The Singapore Sports School and The Direct School Admission scheme, much more could be done to recognise and support sporting talents.

While Schooling received praise, other athletes who have won less high-profile competitions are not given the same level of attention. In turn, this makes it less likely that aspiring young athletes will see sports as a viable option to pursue in Singapore. Even in professional levels, many athletes from Singapore are not given equal treatment in terms of competitions and salary compared to those from other countries. A current example is Tan Cheng Hoe, who recently became the national coach for the Malaysian football team. He was only approached by the Football Association of Malaysia after he made a name for himself in Malaysia's football leagues first - while he had the potential to be a coach before this, a lack of recognition in Singapore meant that he somehow ended up being the first foreign national coach for the Malaysian football team.   \n\nIn summary, sporting achievement is not given adequate recognition in Singapore to a large extent. This is due to an academic-focused society that does not value sports as much, and a lack of monetary rewards and general recognition, from school levels to the professional level. There is room for improvement in terms of how sporting achievements are regarded in Singapore, and this could lead to better development of sports and athletes in our country.",

However, these sports do not receive the same level of recognition or support as national-level sports. The lack of support for grassroots sports can prevent young and aspiring athletes from realizing their full potential.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has made significant progress in promoting sporting activities and recognizing sports achievement, there is still room for improvement.

The focus on high-level competition and achievement can create a negative environment in which leisure sporting activities or participation in non-elite competitions are not valued as highly.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has made significant strides in recognizing sporting achievement, there is still a need to review and enhance current practices to ensure that all levels of achievement in sport are appreciated in society. This can be achieved by raising public awareness of less-known sports, increasing media coverage for all sports, promoting participation in sports regardless of competition levels, and providing more recognition and appreciation for non-elite athletes. By doing so, Singapore can create a more inclusive sports culture that values and embraces the achievements of all athletes.",

As a result, the recognition of sports achievement may not be sufficient, and the athletes may not receive the necessary support and resources to excel.\n\nAnother challenge is the lack of media coverage and public interest in certain sports, which affects the recognition of sporting achievement. In Singapore, some sports such as football, basketball, and volleyball attract more media coverage and public interest than other sports such as hockey, cricket, and rugby. As a result, athletes in less popular sports may not receive the same recognition or opportunities as those in popular sports do. This can impact the motivation and determination of athletes as the lack of recognition can be demotivating and discouraging.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has made progress in recognizing sporting achievement, there is still room for improvement in ensuring that all sports and athletes receive adequate recognition. This includes promoting sports awareness and appreciation across all sports, allocating sufficient resources and support towards athletes in different sports, and providing equal opportunities for all athletes to excel in their chosen fields.

Some sports, such as basketball and football, may receive more attention and recognition than other sports such as fencing and golf. Additionally, sporting achievements in local or regional competitions may not receive as much recognition as those in international competitions such as the Olympics.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has made significant progress in promoting sporting activities and recognizing sports achievement, there is still room for improvement. The emphasis on academic excellence over sporting achievement and the varying levels of recognition for different types of sports and competitions highlight the challenges regarding the recognition of sports achievement in Singapore.

While national borders are not particularly restrictive to the highly mobile, cosmopolitan parts of the population, those who are refugees are usually shunned as they are seen as unproductive and resource-grabbing. The often-raised question of \"Why are we providing them with housing etc. when they are not one of us?\" reveals the mentality of scarcity and how  citizens are conditioned to believe that the life of one of their own is more important to one not of their own.\nNational boundaries are also problematic for economic development. They are used for wealthier countries to suppress those which are less powerful. National boundaries restrict trade between countries, and some countries like America also impose tariffs on imports for particular industries in order to protect their own. While there are the ironically termed \"Free-Trade-Agreements\", they allow goods to flow freely only between countries which are part of the agreement, and often exemplify unequal balances of power between countries. The developing countries are made to open up their economies so that the wealthier can purchase their natural resources, but they may not be given the same kind of access to those of the developed thanks to protectionist policies. On the other hand, multinational companies which are footloose in their operations often have manufacturing in one country, research and development in another and their markets in another. These companies thus facilitate the flow of people, goods and resources across national boundaries, and countries suspend concepts of sovereignty in order to woo their investment.\nOverall, the concept of national boundaries are thus increasingly being challenged in the global age we are in, whether by the increasing prominence of cities or multinational companies. In China, being from Beijing would already distinguish one from someone from Shanghai. When Trump won the presidential elections, some in California suggested \"independence\". After all, national boundaries also vary in size. Some countries have up to a billion people, like China. Being \"imagined\", the larger they are in scale, the more fragile the common identity is. Cities have thus emerged as a more probable scale to construct a singular identity around.\nWhat we have thus is a world where national boundaries are used only to the advantage of those in power. In the past, sovereignty was used by colonial masters to justify conquest. Today,  it is reinforced by countries trying to keep out refugees. What has changed is that it is also used more selectively in our global age. It is invoked when it suits the countries\" interests, yet disregarded when countries want to attract multinational companies and talented manpower. National boundaries thus contribute to unequal outcomes for individuals and countries, and are not so easily justified in today'sworld.",

Globalization has increased the interdependence between countries, as firms and individuals seek out new markets, better technologies, and cheaper inputs. National borders create artificial barriers to trade, reducing economic efficiency and creating inefficiencies such as transport and transaction costs. The longer it takes to move goods across borders, the more expensive they become, and fewer people will want to trade with a particular country. By restricting the flow of goods and people, national borders limit economic growth opportunities and make countries more inward-looking.\n\nAdditionally, national borders have negative effects on humanitarian efforts. With global catastrophes such as natural disasters or pandemics, national governments are often required to work together to resolve these issues. Natural disasters have no regard for borders and can easily cause irreparable damage. Borders and the restrictions they place on the movement of people and goods can prevent life-saving supplies and assistance from arriving in time. The same goes for pandemics, whereby many countries restrict the movement of people or prohibit entry entirely. However, this can cause added strain and problems in the country, including increasing the death rate and preventing medical professionals from entering a location to assist with containment.\n\nIn conclusion, while national borders have historically played an essential role in maintaining national identity and security, in the global age, they have limited justification. The economic, humanitarian and social benefits of a world without borders far outweigh the benefits of their existence. It is time we eliminate national boundaries and view ourselves as a collective global society, trading freely and promoting cooperation instead of enacting policies that breed separation and exclusivity.

Should national boundaries not exist, these people could move to wherever they please, without being shunned or restricted. Essentially, national boundaries produce a society which privileges some individuals over others.\nFurthermore, national boundaries have currency in creating self-contained states, which lead to issues related to foreign policy, economics and immigration. While some may argue that control over these aspects is necessary for the nation's stability, national boundaries may not be the most effective way of accomplishing these goals. For example, cooperation between nations on foreign policy could be achieved through international organisations such as the United Nations. Ultimately, national boundaries create unnecessary obstacles to global progress, as finding common ground becomes difficult when they are insurmountable.\nIn conclusion, while national boundaries are a product of history, they have become impractical and unfair in today's global age. Globalisation has brought about interconnectivity, inclusiveness and has challenged these constructs. Concepts which may have been necessary for stabilisation during a certain era need not be relevant in today's context.

National boundaries have created a system that denies them basic human rights and privileges, such as access to healthcare, education and even the ability to work legally. \n\nSecondly, national boundaries have led to the uneven global distribution of resources. The arbitrary drawing of boundaries has created nation-states with vastly different levels of natural resources and economic capabilities. For example, a country in the Middle East may be rich with oil fields, while a country in Southeast Asia may not have any. This uneven distribution of resources has led to economic disparity, causing some countries to remain impoverished and underdeveloped while others thrive and grow richer. This has perpetuated a global system of inequality, with those in power benefiting from the position of their own national boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that national boundaries have given people a sense of identity and belonging, it is a problematic concept that is no longer justifiable in the global age we inhabit. National boundaries were largely an invention of European states during the centuries of imperialism and colonialism. Today, national boundaries continue to serve as a means of control, even if that means denying basic human rights, access to resources and a better life for others.

Secondly, national boundaries fuel nationalism, a form of identity politics which prioritises the needs of the nation above anything else. This is particularly dangerous in a globalised world where we are all interconnected. Nationalism creates resentment against immigrants, generates a fear of \u2018the other\u2019, and reinforces the idea of a nation as a closed entity. This creates barriers in communication, trade, and collaboration.\nHowever, despite these shortcomings, we cannot deny that national boundaries do have some relevance. As much as we are interconnected, we are still defined by our unique cultures and histories, and we need a sense of identity and belonging. We can argue against the notion of national boundaries, but we cannot deny that they are entrenched in our way of life. Instead, we should strive for a balance between the two \u2013 recognising the importance of our national identity while also acknowledging the fact that we are part of a larger, interconnected world.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that in the global age we inhabit, national boundaries are more of a hindrance than a help.

Within national boundaries there may exist different regions or states, each with their own economic and social problems. Such inequalities may be glaringly obvious within the same national boundaries which seem artificial, and may perpetuate over long periods of time. Thirdly, national boundaries also affect the access to resources and goods. Such boundaries can lead to the hoarding of resources within a nation, rather than sharing them equitably with other nations. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, countries with more resources have been criticised for hoarding vaccines, while poorer countries are left in dire straits.\nHowever, the notion of national boundaries still has some form of practical relevance in our global age. National boundaries still exist because of the idea of sovereignty, which allows countries to exercise their own laws and regulations within their own borders. Sovereignty helps countries to regulate who comes into or leaves the country, and helps to maintain law and order. It also allows countries to negotiate with other countries on a level playing field and to defend their interests. In addition, it also helps to foster a sense of national identity, which is important for creating social cohesion within a country.\nIn conclusion, while national boundaries may still have some practical relevance, it is important to understand that they are a construct of history and politics. The global age in which we inhabit today has seen an increased importance being placed on issues that transcend national boundaries. Climate change, economic interdependence, and human rights are just some of the many issues that are global in nature and require collaboration and cooperation between nations. As such, the world needs leaders who are willing to think beyond national boundaries and work towards solutions that will benefit humanity as a whole.",

The World Bank reports that developing countries lose up to $1 trillion a year due to trade restrictions \u2013 restrictions imposed because of national boundaries. The flow of goods and services is so severely restricted that it hinders the growth and development of developing countries. Finally, national boundaries further perpetuate political conflicts. Countries are quick to lay claim to territory and resources, leading to disputes, sometimes culminating in wars. The recent conflict between India and Pakistan over the Kashmir region is an example of how national boundaries can cause conflicts,which affect the peace and stability of entire regions.\nIn conclusion, national boundaries are a construct that has inflicted much harm. It is understandable why they came about, but they are not natural or necessary. Countries have much to gain by working together, rather than focusing on differences. The global age we inhabit demands a new mindset where we work together as a global community, rather than as separate and competitive nations.

The virus has spread rapidly across national borders, highlighting the need for collaboration and cooperation between countries. In fact, it has become clear that an issue in one part of the world can quickly become a global problem. Therefore, in the global age we inhabit, national boundaries serve more to divide rather than unite.\nHowever, it is important to recognise that the erasure of national boundaries is not a simple or straightforward solution. National boundaries serve to give people a sense of identity and belonging. Removing these boundaries can cause confusion and conflict among different ethnic groups and cultures. Furthermore, it may be argued that the existence of national boundaries can lead to healthy competition between nations, driving innovation and progress.\nIn conclusion, the notion that there is no justification for national boundaries in the global age we inhabit today holds some truth. National boundaries are mere social constructions that have been imposed upon people through political, social and historical factors. The unequal power structures that result from national boundaries continue to have negative implications for migration and global cooperation. However, it may not be realistic to completely remove national boundaries and it is important to also consider the potential consequences of doing so.

National boundaries limit the freedom of individuals to connect with others beyond their borders and enrich their lives. Secondly, national boundaries are also used to create conflicts between groups and countries. Territorial disputes between countries are often a consequence of national boundaries, and have led to tensions that can escalate into military encounters, such as the conflict between India and Pakistan. Last but not least, there are also economic implications of national boundaries. In today's globalised world where goods are traded across borders, tariffs, trade agreements, and regulations create barriers to the movement of goods and services, and affect global economic interactions.\nIn conclusion, in the global age we inhabit today, national boundaries are increasingly viewed as arbitrary and impediments to progress. While they may have been necessary in the past to end religious or political conflicts and consolidate power, they now limit individual freedoms and create challenges for peaceful coexistence and economic development. It is high time for us to critically examine the notion of national boundaries and realise that we all share one planet and one common humanity, and that it is only through working together beyond our borders that we can build a better and more equitable world.",

For instance, the developed countries are in a better position to push for policies and trade agreements that benefit them, while the developing countries have to play according to the rules set by the more dominant and powerful states. The national boundaries therefore act as a barrier to equal opportunities and access to resources.\nOn the other hand, the argument for national boundaries can be grounded in the preservation of cultural identity and the protection of national security. By having national boundaries, countries are able to preserve their unique culture and heritage, as well as regulate the flow of goods and people for their own security. It also provides a sense of belonging and identity for the individual, as well as an avenue for political expression and participation in the democratic process.\nIn conclusion, while the concept of national boundaries may have had a logical place in history, its relevance in the global age is questionable, particularly in the face of global issues such as climate change and social injustice. While the preservation of national identity and security is important, there needs to be a balance between national interests and the global community.

This results in escalating conflicts and crises around the world, as people are forced to leave their homes and seek refuge elsewhere, leading to overcrowding and tensions between nations. Additionally, national boundaries often create economic inequalities, as nations that are more prosperous are able to enforce their boundaries more strictly, preventing others from crossing over and sharing in their prosperity. This leads to greater inequality between nations, as those that are less prosperous often remain trapped in poverty with little access to resources and opportunities.\nHowever, it should also be noted that national boundaries can be useful in maintaining some form of order in the world. In a world without national boundaries, there would be no framework for regulating the movement of people and goods between nations. This could result in chaos and disorder, as different groups compete for resources and territory with no agreed-upon rules for resolving disputes. The existence of national boundaries allows for the creation of national governments, which can provide public services, enforce laws and regulations, and coordinate responses to crises. It also allows people to feel a sense of belonging and loyalty to their country, which can promote social cohesion and national identity.\nIn conclusion, while the concept of national boundaries is a social construct that has been used for centuries, their continuance in the global age is increasingly unnecessary. We need to acknowledge how national boundaries have been formed and their historical contexts and legacies. The idea of dividing people on the basis of imaginary lines can be harmful in many ways. While national boundaries may be useful for maintaining order, regulating movement, and promoting social cohesion, they also lead to inequality, displacement, and conflict.

Due to the belief in nationalism and sovereignty, it is difficult for one country to help another without being accused of interference in internal affairs. This disparity between countries results in an unequal distribution of resources, power and wealth, perpetuating global inequality.\nHowever, to say that there is no justification for national boundaries in the global age is an oversimplification. The idea of a nation offers a sense of belonging and unity among people. National pride, when it does not lead to authoritarianism, can be a positive aspect, especially for small nation-states. Furthermore, it is not practical to obliterate national boundaries immediately, as it could lead to chaos and conflict between countries. Borders serve a practical purpose in ensuring security and the efficient allocation of resources, among others. It is necessary, however, to recognise that national boundaries are a social construct and should not be the basis for discrimination, oppression or exploitation.\nIn conclusion, while national boundaries and the notion of the nation-state provide a sense of belonging and organise people for practical purposes, they are ultimately a social construct and perpetuate unequal power structures. The global age we inhabit calls for us to recognise this construct, and to not allow it to be used as the basis for oppression or exploitation. While it may be impractical to completely abolish national boundaries in the immediate future, we should aim to move towards a world where borders are less important, where people are free to migrate and where power, resources and wealth are more equitably distributed."

The gig economy or sharing economy allows people to make use of technology to optimise the use of their resources, whether tangible like car seats or intangible like time and creativity. Grab and Youtube are two classic examples of empowering individuals to have another side job that can become as well-paying as their mainstream job. These sharing platforms \u2013 whether to share car rides or to share videos \u2013 allow people to make a market from their skills. As P.J. Abdul Kalam said, \"the youth today need to be enabled to become job generators from job seekers.\" This is also necessarily a negative trend because having multiple careers empower individuals to do what they actually enjoy and are passionate about. Leaving the typical nine-to-five working lifestyle for a freelancing manner of getting employment has become increasingly more popular amongst young people, with over half of workers below 24 in France, Germany, Italy and Spain on fixed-term contracts rather than the traditional long term ones. Loyalty to companies is also less important to individuals who want job flexibility and autonomy over the jobs they do. Thus, technological advancement which has opened up the possibilities for flexible and new jobs has made young people consider job satisfaction and autonomy to be more important than job stability. As the saying goes, \"If you do what you love, you never have to work for a day\". It seems that the younger generation today are particularly believers of this.\nOf course, there are again exceptions, particularly for those who commit themselves to a particular skill or sport. David Beckham once said that \"I treat my job as a hobby. It'ssomething I love doing.\"  For those highly passionate about their choice of employment, a single career is probably the only thing they can envision themselves doing. After all, for particular occupations, more years really do mean becoming better at the job. Other than athletes who will not benefit from switching sports every two years should they want to be at the top of their game, other occupations which require years of dedication include those which are artisanal in nature. For example, leather crafters or tailors are people whose skills get refined over time, making them better at the job as they stay in the career longer. These are also jobs which fundamentally defy technological disruption. A good sportsman is considered good precisely because he is meant to stretch the potential of what a human can do, rather than being aided by machines. Art and artisanal products are precious and valued because they are made by people and thus unique, rather than being standardised and mass produced. Hence, there is still a place for these careers in our economy, and these careers, when performed by the very best and the committees, usually span a lifetime.\nUltimately, the idea of work and how work is done are always undergoing changes. Save for a few, a single career is not only unrealistic, but also unfulfilling and unproductive. Instead of trying to force oneself to commit to a single career, it is more important that people find work meaningful for themselves as well as for society \u2013 whether in a single career or multiple ones.",

If they are not tied to a single career path, they have the opportunity to pursue their passions and interests, rather than simply pursuing financial stability or status. Moreover, individuals may find they have a greater sense of control over their professional development and career trajectory.\n\nAnother implication of this shift is the need for a focus on lifelong learning. As individuals switch careers and learn new skills, it will be important to ensure they have access to the resources and training they need to be successful. This could be achieved through government policies promoting lifelong learning, or through the private sector investing in training and development programs for their employees.\n\nIn conclusion, the idea of having a single career for a lifetime is becoming increasingly unrealistic in our age of rapid technological advancement.

Job-switching may also entail a loss of benefits such as seniority, pension, and job security which will be meaningful to some people.\nOverall, while there are some drawbacks in constantly switching jobs or careers, the fact is that technological advancements are coming at a faster pace than ever before.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ue. However, in a study examining economic inequality, it is discovered that economic growth does not have a direct correlation with income inequality. It is rather the policies put in place which affect the pathways in which economic growth contributes to, or mitigates, income inequality. Countries like Nigeria which are wealthy but do not invest in education and welfare lag behind, but many wealthy countries such as Sweden do see much lower income inequality. Thus, the blame lies not in continuous economic growth, but rather on inequitable policies.\nLastly, economic growth has been painted as the main driver of climate change problems, and this is for good reason. The rapid industrialization which led to exponential economic growth also caused an exponential increase in carbon emissions, driving our world towards ecological doom. And developing countries which wish to continue to grow their economy are going to follow in the footsteps of developed ones through generating carbon emissions as they power their manufacturing plants and burn fossil fuels. Other environmental harm is also caused in the process of generating economic growth, such as pollution of water bodies by manufacturing plants, the destruction of biodiversity due to overfishing and oil spills. However, there is a sliver of hope amidst all this doom and gloom \u2013 the concept of decoupling economic growth from fossil fuels is growing to promote green growth, which is economic growth that is also environmentally sustainable. For example, there has been increasing investment in renewable energy such as solar energy, particularly in developing places like Africa. Under the New Deal on Energy, more and more of the continent'sinvestment into energy infrastructure have been directed towards solar energy projects, which will emit less carbon emissions while still powering the economy. Hence, continuous economic growth, coupled with proper environmental policies, is needed and desirable for further development.\nYet, it is also crucial to note that income inequality and environmental issues both threaten the continuity of economic growth in turn. The former causes social instability which can lead to the collapse of regimes such as seen during Arab Spring, while the latter can also threaten it, as it causes disruptions to food supply or destroy existing infrastructure. In fact, with most economic activities concentrated on coastal cities around the world, coastal flooding and sea level rises will pose a huge threat to economic growth in those regions and the world. Thus, even for those who agree that economic growth must remain a priority, it must also happen in tandem with more equitable distribution as well as environmental protection. This is not impossible, as shown previously, through far-sighted and balanced policies.\nUltimately, economic growth is desirable because human well-being is desirable. It is thus hopeful that as humanity has learnt lessons on how economic growth, if unchecked, can threaten our initial goals, that it is important to choose a different path where all three kinds of sustainability \u2013 economic, social and environmental \u2013 are emphasized. This is why, if taken to the true sense of the word, continuous economic growth will be desirable, since it will also have to be sustainable.",

While economic growth can create job opportunities and increase incomes for some individuals, it can also exacerbate income inequality and leave some individuals behind. This is particularly true in developing countries, where economic growth can often disproportionately benefit a small subset of the population.\n\nFurthermore, the pursuit of economic growth can often come at the expense of social and political freedoms. For example, countries that prioritize economic growth may be more likely to suppress dissent and limit freedom of expression in order to maintain stability and ensure that economic growth remains uninterrupted.\n\nGiven these drawbacks, it is clear that continuous economic growth is not an entirely desirable goal. Instead, it is important to prioritize sustainable economic development that considers broader social, environmental, and political concerns. This means that economic growth should be pursued in a way that does not harm the environment or exacerbate economic inequality, and that prioritizes public goods and services that improve the overall quality of life for individuals and communities.\n\nOne way to achieve this is through the adoption of more sustainable economic models, such as circular economies, which prioritize resource efficiency and waste reduction. Additionally, investment in renewable energy and other sustainable technologies can help reduce the negative environmental impact of economic growth, while also creating job opportunities and promoting economic stability.\n\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of continuous economic growth has some merit, it is important to consider the drawbacks and limitations of this goal.

Income inequality can result in political instability and unrest, such as the Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States, as well as have negative effects on human development, such as disparities in healthcare and education, which in turn perpetuate poverty. As such, the pursuit of continuous economic growth must be tempered with policies aimed at addressing income inequality, such as progressive taxation and redistributive measures, in order to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared more equally by all in society.\nMoreover, the pursuit of continuous economic growth may lead to environmental degradation, with the negative effects of human activity on climate change, deforestation, and ocean acidification. While economic growth has historically been associated with increased emissions and energy consumption, there are countries which have been able to decouple the link between economic growth and environmental destruction. For instance, in some Scandinavian countries, renewable energy sources have been able to be harnessed as a result of government subsidies, which has thus mitigated the negative environmental effects of economic growth. Therefore, the pursuit of continuous economic growth must be coupled with sustainable practices such as renewable energy development and resource management. This ensures that the benefits of economic growth are not offset by negative externalities, which would result in a net loss for society.\nIn conclusion, while there are drawbacks to the pursuit of continuous economic growth, such as income inequality and environmental degradation, it must also be acknowledged that it is a necessary precondition for human development and improvements in people'swell-being.

This can lead to social unrest and instability, as was seen in the 2011 Occupy Wall Street movement in the United States.\nFurthermore, the pursuit of continuous economic growth may also come at the cost of environmental sustainability. The over-exploitation of natural resources or emissions, which occur due to industrialisation and increased production, can lead to environmental degradation and irreversible climate change. For example, the industrial activities in China, which sparked its economic growth, have led to severe air pollution, which has negative implications for the respiratory health of millions of people. Therefore, the pursuit of continuous economic growth must be tempered by environmental considerations to ensure the sustainable use of resources for future generations.\nIn conclusion, while continuous economic growth seems desirable at first, it comes with several drawbacks that must be considered. Income inequality and environmental degradation are some of the most pressing issues that arise from the pursuit of economic growth at all costs. Nonetheless, growth is critical to achieving development, and to reduce poverty and improve human development indicators. Hence, to what extent economic growth is desirable, depends on whether we compromise natural resources and social justice to achieve it.

This has led to social unrest, and the widening income gap is not just detrimental to the poorer sections of society, but it challenges the very idea of social stability, which is a basic prerequisite for growth in the first place.\nMoreover, one cannot ignore the harm that continuous economic growth can do to the environment. The pursuit of economic growth requires the use of natural resources such as oil, coal, timber and water, and, as a result, it degrades the environment that we rely on for our survival. The byproducts of economic growth, such as emissions and waste, have caused vast environmental damage. Global warming, deforestation, and species extinction are all linked to economic growth. There is a need to shift to a more sustainable and environmentally friendly mode of development, where the goals of economic growth and environmental protection can coexist.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth is a desirable goal only if it is accompanied by human and social development, environmental sustainability, and the prevention of income inequality. Economic growth is necessary, but only as long as it serves the people of society and not just the wealthy elite. Emphasis should be placed not just on economic growth, but also on the well-being of society as a whole. As a society, we need to shift our mindset from the pursuit of economic growth at all costs, to a more balanced mode of development that takes into account the needs of both present and future generations.",
                "ue as well, where income inequality is at an all-time high despite economic growth. This is because economic growth is not a cure-all for all social issues, and it may even create new ones. If income inequality is not addressed, it leads to social unrest, which in turn could slow economic growth because of a lack of investor confidence and stability.\n\nAnother consideration is that pursuing uninterrupted economic growth is increasingly seen as causing irreversible environmental damage. Economic growth is often accompanied by negative externalities, be it air pollution from factories, deforestation from agriculture, or depletion of our natural resources. The impacts of climate change are also being felt globally, with scientists warning us of rising sea levels and more extreme weather patterns. These effects pose a risk to future economic growth, as the costs of adapting to climate change could be catastrophic. This is why certain countries have started to adopt sustainable practices and policies, such as green energy and reducing reliance on single-use plastics, to mitigate the negative environmental impact brought about by economic growth.\n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth has both advantages and disadvantages, depending on how it is managed. While economic growth has brought about great improvements in human development, it is not a miracle cure for social disparities, and the environmental costs of growth must be managed carefully. Continuous economic growth can be desirable so long as it is balanced with social and environmental sustainability, rather than being pursued at all costs.",

Income inequality can lead to social problems such as crime and unrest as well as possibilities of political unrest or even collapse.\nMoreover, the pursuit of continuous economic growth without regard for the environment can lead to detrimental effects on the ecosystem. One of the most devastating effects is climate change, which threatens the existence of human beings itself. Economic growth at the cost of the environment leads to external environmental costs, which can threaten the long-term health of the planet and its habitants. For example, the Amazon rainforest is being cleared for agricultural and urban development resulting in loss of biodiversity and the release of carbon dioxide which further exacerbates climate change. Plastic waste in our oceans is forecasted to exceed the total mass of fish by 2050 unless action is taken.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth is still desirable to a large extent because it still holds as a promise of better economic opportunities and material well-being for society at large, but it should be done sustainably, preserving the environment for future generations, and ensuring that the economic benefits are equitably shared to avoid socially divisive effects of increasing income inequality.",
                "ue as well. According to a report by Oxfam, the wealth of billionaires increased by USD 900 billion in 2020, while the rest of the world saw the greatest increase in poverty. The rising inequality intensifies the political polarization in society, creating social unrest and instability, which hinders sustainable growth and development.\nMoreover, economic growth can also have severe negative externalities attached to it that harm the environment and human health, thereby reducing social welfare. The over-extraction and exploitation of natural resources for economic growth contribute to environmental degradation, causing pollution, deforestation, and damage to ecosystems. Similarly, the escalating consumption and disposal of manufactured goods, while boosting economic growth, exacerbate pollution and waste, causing negative impacts on human health and the natural environment. These environmental hazards often fall most heavily on the poor and marginalized communities, which lack voice and power, leading to social injustices. Hence, it is essential to consider the environmental and social costs of economic growth and promote smart, sustainable development instead.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth is indeed a desirable goal, given that it is accompanied by human development, social justice, and environmental sustainability. By investing in human development, distributing resources equitably, and safeguarding the environment, economic growth can bring about shared prosperity and well-being for society as a whole. However, policymakers must also be aware that the emphasis on economic growth at the expense of social equity and environmental sustainability may undermine the very foundations of human welfare and civilization. Therefore, a balanced economic growth strategy that prioritizes social and environmental objectives is necessary.",

The Gini coefficient, which measures income inequality, has been steadily increasing in Singapore over the past decade, indicating a greater divide between the rich and poor. This can lead to a multitude of negative outcomes such as social unrest, a decrease in social mobility, and an overall feeling of dissatisfaction among the lower income groups, which can hinder economic growth in the long run.\nMoreover, the relentless pursuit of economic growth may also come at the expense of the environment. The depletion of natural resources, pollution, and deforestation are some of the environmental impacts of economic growth. These issues, if left unchecked, can harm not only the planet but also the long-term sustainability of economic growth itself. Climate change is a prime example of the negative effect that economic activities can have on the environment. The recent UN IPCC report stated that limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5\u00b0C requires \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society\". This implies that economic activities have to be reduced to prevent irreversible impacts of climate change. \nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth has its pros and cons, and determining its desirability hinges on the level of external costs, income inequality, and environmental impact caused. While economic growth has undoubtedly led to improvements in people'swell-being and is necessary for development, the negative impacts on the environment, and income inequality have to be addressed if economic growth is to be sustainable and desirable in the long run. It is important to find a balance between economic growth and other factors such as sustainability, equality, and justice to ensure that everyone benefits from economic growth, not just a select few.",

The inequality generated by economic growth also leads to social and political unrest, as it has the potential to provoke anti-capitalist movements and protests. Therefore, when advocating for continuous economic growth, one has to be mindful of the social inequalities it generates and take steps to address them.\nThe pursuit of continuous economic growth can also have a negative impact on the environment, which can affect the sustainability of economic growth itself. The development of resources and the use of production methods that negatively impact the environment can lead to climate change, resource depletion, and other ecological disasters. Such environmental degradation not only affects the human population but also all other species and ecosystems that depend on them. For instance, the Great Barrier Reef in Australia is currently in danger of extinction due to coral bleaching caused by rising sea temperatures, which can be attributed to human activity. Therefore, when pursuing economic growth, it is important to do so sustainably by applying green technologies and minimizing environmental damage.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth is largely desirable for society and the world, in terms of improving the well-being of people and nations. However, this pursuit should not be done at the cost of social and environmental sustainability. Economic growth should be accompanied by efforts to address social inequality issues and protect the environment.

Climate change, in turn, has resulted in devastating effects on the planet, including natural disasters and loss of biodiversity. These negative externalities have been identified as significant challenges to the sustainability of economic growth.\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of continuous economic growth is desirable to a certain extent as it is linked to the improvement of human well-being and social development. However, there are potential costs associated with this growth, such as environmental degradation and wealth inequality, that need to be addressed for the sustainability of economic growth. As a society, there is a need to find a balance in ensuring economic growth while still being mindful of social and environmental impacts."

            "human_gen_truncate": "xperiences, trial and error, and of course, failures. It can thus be seen that anything innovative in this world must have taken several failures before they can fully materialise and be successful.\nBesides, failure not only allows one to improve in terms of skills specific to one'sgoals, but also develops one'scharacter which is crucial to success. Characteristics like grit, resilience and determination are developed through accepting and making the best out of failure. Many people fail not just for a particular moment, but for an extended period of time, which further tests their resilience. A noteworthy example would be J.K. Rowling who was living on welfare and suffered from her mother'sdeath, a miscarriage and an abusive marriage for seven years after leaving university before the Harry Potter series was published. However, it was also during these seven years that Rowling continuously worked on Harry Potter. Being a \"failure\" did not stop her from trying to achieve success, which she eventually did.\nInterestingly, failure is also an essential part of success even after one has succeeded. As Ellen DeGeneres puts it, \"It'sfailure that gives you the proper perspective on success.\". Someone who has never failed before will take success for granted, as if it is a given. These are the people who will not be able to maintain success for long, akin to wealthy heirs who never knew how difficult it is to earn money and thus squander all their inheritance away. The example of Steve Jobs can help to illustrate this. Jobs was pretty successful until he got ousted from his company by the other stakeholders, making him question if he was a good leader before that. Luckily for Jobs, this was not the end for him, and he quickly bounced back and ultimately regained control of his company again, taking it to greater heights. After this failure, Jobs would never take his success for granted again, for he knows its precarity. This understanding of its precarity also makes success taste sweeter and that much more precious, illustrating how the experience of past failures can contribute to a richer sense of success in future. This appreciation of one'spast failures also makes those who are successful more giving. Coming back to the example of J.K. Rowling, due to her own experiences being in poverty, she gave back to charity tremendously when she became the world'sfirst billionaire author, specifically contributing to anti-poverty and children welfare causes.\nIn summary, failure is indubitably an essential part of success, considering how it is not only inevitable but can be constructive for one'ssuccess. Being afraid of, or avoiding, failure can ironically prevent one from accessing true success. It is then of no wonder that people who have failed then succeeded do not mind sharing about their past failures, because they truly believe that ultimately it is their failures which have helped them get to where they are today.",

Failure can be humbling and provide the drive needed to succeed. Individuals who have failed in the past are often more motivated and determined to succeed than those who have not faced any setbacks. The famous author J.K. Rowling, for instance, was rejected by numerous publishers before her book, Harry Potter, was accepted. Her failures motivated her to keep going, and she eventually became one of the best-selling authors of all time.\n\nFurthermore, failure provides us with the opportunity to re-evaluate our goals and priorities. The experience of failure allows us to reflect on what we really want in life, what we are willing to sacrifice to achieve our goals, and what is truly important to us. This introspection helps individuals develop a clear sense of purpose and motivation, which is essential for success. Therefore, failure is not only an integral part of the journey towards success, but it is also an opportunity for self-discovery and growth.\n\nIn conclusion, while failure may seem like a setback, it is an integral part of success. Failure teaches us valuable lessons, helps us grow, builds our resilience, provides us with motivation, and allows us to re-evaluate our goals and priorities. Therefore, we must embrace failure and recognize it as a stepping stone towards success. As the famous motivational speaker, Zig Ziglar once said, \u201cFailure is not a single, cataclysmic event.

The latter student would have had to face and overcome much more significant obstacles, making the achievement all the more rewarding and significant.\nIn conclusion, failure is indeed an essential part of success because it helps one develop the necessary skills, is essential for true success and also contributes to making success more meaningful. The important thing is to view failure not as the end of the road, but rather as just a pit stop along the way.

            "human_gen_truncate": " boasts the highest reoffense rate in the world at 76 percent. Evidently, prisons are only effective in reforming their inmates if efforts go towards rehabilitative rather than retributive justice.\nAdditionally, if prisons are able to reduce recidivism and control the size of prison populations, they are likely to be more successful in preventing the growth of criminal networks based in prisons. Prison gangs and criminal networks often arise as a rational response to poor conditions within burdened prison systems \u2013 the Californian prison system has about 160,000 inmates, and on average holds a few thousand in each prison. In such a system, there is a large black market for illicit goods, and understaffed prison administrations are unable to provide law and order. This creates the conditions for the growth of prison gangs like the notorious Mexican Mafia, which control life both inside and outside these prisons. In contrast, the Scandinavian prison systems minimize the number of inmates held in each facility, and have reported lower occurrences of criminal organisations fomenting within prisons.\nAt the same time, it must be noted that incarceration often drastically changes communities in ways which might foment crime in the long-term. Prisons will only be effective in preventing crime if they cooperate with external agencies to address the effects of imprisonment on the community. Studies have shown that the children of incarcerated parents tend to move frequently, face financial problems from a young age, struggle with emotional and family instability. Communities with high levels of mass incarceration tend to perpetuate that cycle since incarceration disrupts important social and family structures and roles. Partners which provide support services, such as the Kids in Play programme run by the Salvation Army in Singapore, are able to mitigate these impacts and break the cycle of violence and crime.\nIn conclusion, prisons are only effective in combating crime if they are able to address the root causes of crime, if sufficient resources are diverted to counselling convicts and preparing them for a life outside prison, and if they are able to prevent the agglomeration of criminal networks. This is because their effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of whether they are able to prevent crime from occurring in the long-term. With the right support for criminals who have demonstrated the ability to turn over a new leaf, prisons will be able to prevent crime for good, as criminals are often pushed to reoffend if they are unable to meet their social or economic needs after leaving prison. This often has a positive impact on communities, who may be left with a \"social vacuum\" if convicts are not rehabilitated and the impact of mass incarceration is not mitigated. If prisons are able to prevent the growth of criminal networks, they will be better able to prevent the vicious cycle of crime from perpetuating itself.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " offenders end up committing more crimes due to the influence of fellow inmates within overcrowded facilities, making prisons breeding grounds for crime.\n\nFurthermore, imprisonment puts a strain on the financial resources of states. The cost of maintaining prisons is high, and it is not always effective in reducing crime. In the United States, for instance, the cost of imprisoning a person for a year is approximately $31,286. This cost can be better used in establishing sustainable rehabilitation programs that can help reduce the rate of recidivism. These programs would prepare former inmates to be reintegrated into society; thus, reducing their reliance on social welfare and increasing the chances of them becoming useful members of society.\n\nAdditionally, extended periods of prison sentences for non-violent offenses only lead to overcrowding in prisons. In many cases, the length of imprisonment is not proportional to the offense committed. Non-violent offenses such as minor drug charges lead to disproportionate imprisonment sentences. This not only leads to prison overcrowding but also results in a higher rate of recidivism as the offenders may become influenced by hardened criminals within the prison system.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of how effective prisons are in addressing the problem of crime is a complex one. Imprisonment alone is not sufficient to deal with the problem of crime. Therefore, rehabilitation programs should be an integrated approach that should be used to address recidivism and reduce the cost of maintaining prisons. Offenders should receive counseling services, medical care, and skills to be able to reintegrate back into society. This approach would have a positive impact on the criminal justice system by reducing recidivism rates while saving taxpayers' money. Prisons should not only serve as deterrents to would-be offenders but also be centers for change and rehabilitation.",

                "has a higher recidivism rate. Resources, therefore, need to be redirected towards rehabilitation, providing education and job training, and mental health and addiction treatment in order for prisons to be effective in mitigating crime in the long term.\nMoreover, prisons that maintain a small critical size where prisoners are not packed like sardines in a can help to prevent the growth of criminal networks. In contrast, overcrowding in prisons, as observed in countries like the United States and the Philippines, creates a breeding ground for gang activity, where gang leaders are able to exert control over even non-gang-affiliated prisoners for their own benefit. Overcrowded prisons also tend to be underfunded, understaffed, and therefore more violent and less conducive to rehabilitation. \nIn addition, mass incarceration, which has increased in recent decades in the United States due to the war on drugs, has had a particularly devastating impact on communities of colour. The disproportionate impact of imprisonment on communities of colour only reinforces the cycle of poverty and criminality by stripping families of breadwinners and stigmatising the formerly incarcerated. Therefore, addressing the root causes of crime such as poverty and unemployment, and investing in alternative restorative justice programs to imprisonment, may be more effective in addressing the problem of crime in these communities.\nIn conclusion, whether imprisonment is effective in mitigating crime depends on how effective it is in rehabilitating criminals, preventing criminal networks, and addressing the collateral impact on communities. Imprisonment is only effective if it adequately addresses the root cause of the crime and if resources are directed to rehabilitation, education, and training. With a more comprehensive approach to criminal justice, complemented by investment in poverty alleviation measures and restorative justice programs, the criminal justice system could potentially be more effective in reducing crime rates.",
                "leads to a higher rate of recidivism. It is thus imperative that resources be diverted towards rehabilitating prisoners so that they may benefit from them.\nFurthermore, it is important that prisons maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks, as an overcapacity of prisons and large number of prisoners can lead to an increase in criminal activity in communities. Large prisons tend to facilitate the \"criminalization of everyday interactions\", in which prisons \u2013 rather than rehabilitate inmates \u2013 reinforce the criminal behaviour and habits that were produced prior to confinement. This not only creates a revolving door of imprisoned individuals but also has long-term negative impacts on society as prisoners return to their communities with a heightened proclivity towards criminal behaviour. To mitigate this, prisons need to introduce measures like community-based corrections and supervision, and engage with local communities in the reintegration of former prisoners.\nLastly, the mass incarceration of individuals, particularly those from lower socio-economic backgrounds or ethnic minorities, has an adverse effect on communities. The stigma of imprisonment is one that serves to exclude individuals from their communities and causes further marginalization and disempowerment. In the long run, this only promotes more criminal activity, as those who feel they have no alternative to their current situation and experience social exclusion may make criminal activity their source of income or resort to other forms of delinquency. Therefore, prisons need to act as a medium for reintegration instead of mere punishment, by supporting the education and training of prisoners for future job opportunities, and by working with NGOs to provide further community support.\nIn conclusion, prisons can be effective in addressing the problem of crime, but only if it focuses on rehabilitation, maintains a small critical size, and is able to reintegrate convicts back into society. The prison system has to move away from being seen as a punishment but rather as a means to address the root causes of the crime, and to treat the prisoners once in there. It is in doing so that we can see long-term solutions to the issue of crime.",
                ", fails to rehabilitate criminals effectively. This highlights the importance of diverting resources towards rehabilitative programmes rather than just building more prisons.\nFurthermore, prisons are only effective if they are maintained at a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks. In the absence of a critical size constraint, prisons can become breeding grounds for gangs and become institutions that are run by inmates rather than the correctional officers. This was exemplified in Pelican Bay State Prison in California, where gangs were able to organize drug trafficking rings, control inmate housing assignments, and engage in violent clashes, highlighting the limitations of imprisonment as a solution to crime.\nFinally, prisons are only effective in mitigating crime if they are able to address the impact that mass incarceration has on communities. Mass incarceration can create a cyclical effect of crime by stigmatizing communities, tearing apart families and the social fabric, and disrupting the economic activity of communities. The stigmatization of criminal offences has led to \"collateral consequences\" of conviction, such as a loss of voting rights, disqualification from certain jobs, and denials of public benefits. Given the overrepresentation of people of color in prisons, this has resulted in the institutionalization of a racial caste system, fueling racial tensions, and contributing to the erosion of trust between communities and law enforcement agencies \u2013 thus perpetuating cycles of intergenerational crime.\nTo sum up, the effectiveness of prisons in addressing the problem of crime depends on whether they are able to rehabilitate criminals by addressing the root causes of crime, whether resources are directed towards rehabilitation, whether prisons are maintained at a small critical size, and if prisons can mitigate the impact of mass incarceration on communities.",
                "has not been particularly successful in rehabilitating inmates and reducing recidivism.\nAnother important factor in the effectiveness of prisons is the size of prisons. A small critical size of prisons is important in preventing the growth of criminal networks and reducing the rate of recidivism. When prisons become overcrowded, it becomes difficult to design programs that cater to individual rehabilitation needs. According to a report published by the National Academy of Sciences, recidivism rates drop as the prison population declines, in part because smaller prison systems can be more easily managed, and in part because fewer inmates means that resources can be allocated more effectively towards reducing criminal behavior. Conversely, mass incarceration not only fails to reduce crime, it may be counterproductive because it perpetuates criminal activity in disadvantaged communities and leads to destabilisation of families.\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in addressing the problem of crime must be evaluated on several grounds. Imprisonment can be effective in rehabilitating criminals, but only if the prison sentence can address the root causes of the crime. Furthermore, when prisons divert resources towards rehabilitating inmates, recidivism rates tend to drop. If prisons can maintain a small critical size, criminal networks can be avoided, and resources can be allocated more effectively. Nonetheless, if prisons become too overcrowded, the social consequences can be dire, perpetuating criminal activity in disadvantaged communities and destabilising families. Ultimately, whether prisons are effective is contingent on the policies and resources dedicated to promoting rehabilitation and combating recidivism.",
                "has higher recidivism rates. The focus on rehabilitation in prisons is hence crucial in making them effective in addressing crime, but this emphasis is lacking in many criminal justice systems.\nMoreover, prisons can only be effective in addressing crime if resources are diverted towards rehabilitation and other reintegration programs for offenders. This means that money and manpower must be invested into training prison staff, providing skill-based education to inmates, and following up on their progress after their release. For instance, providing vocational training to inmates, such as woodworking or horticulture, can prepare them for a job when they leave the prison's gates. When inmates leave with a skill set, they can adjust more easily to life outside prison, and are less likely to resort to crime to make a living. A study by the Rand Corporation indicated that inmates who received vocational training during their sentence were 28 percent more likely to obtain employment upon release, and 43 percent less likely to reoffend. Such rehabilitation programmes are not only effective in reducing the chances of reoffending by ex-offenders, it is also a humane approach to deal with crime.\nHowever, a key obstacle to making prisons more effective is their size. The reality is that prisons often provide a conducive environment for the growth of criminal networks. The concentration of prisoners, combined with a lack of individualized attention, insufficient healthcare, and woefully inadequate psychiatric care, is suspected to be one cause of the high rates of violence in prisons. In addition, overcrowding makes it impossible for prisons to provide adequate reintegration programmes for inmates. When prison populations reach a critical size, beyond which inmates start to interact more, prisons become breeding grounds for gang culture that can persist beyond their release. This, on the other hand, makes it harder for prisoners to reintegrate into society, and increase the possibility of recidivism.\nFinally, it is important for prisons to acknowledge and mitigate the adverse impact of mass incarceration on communities. When individuals are removed from their communities on a large scale, the repercussions are felt beyond the families and social circles of the incarcerated. Children of incarcerated parents may have to be placed into foster care or raised by relatives, resulting in broken families and emotional trauma. Maternal incarceration, specifically, is associated with poorer school performance, behavioural problems, and diminished social mobility. Furthermore, mass incarceration temporarily removes large sections of the population from the workforce, which, in turn, negatively impacts the economic prospects of entire communities.\nIn conclusion, it can be argued that prisons can only be effective in addressing crime if they are able to reform criminals by addressing the root causes of the crime and by means of appropriate rehabilitation programmes. Only then can prisons reduce the rate of recidivism. Additionally, resources need to be allocated toward rehabilitation, man power training, and other programs for ex-offenders, and prisons should not exceed a critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks. Finally, it is imperative for prisons to acknowledge and mitigate the adverse impact that mass incarceration has on families and communities. All of these components should be in place to ensure that prisons remain an effective tool in addressing the problem of crime.",
                "has an extremely high recidivism rate. This suggests that prisons can only effectively address the problem of crime when resources are redirected towards rehabilitation, rather than solely punishment.\nAnother factor that should be considered in evaluating the effectiveness of prisons is whether these facilities are able to maintain a small and critical size. A study by the National Institute of Corrections has found that most prisons in the United States are overcrowded and operate beyond their capacity. Overcrowding creates an environment which is conducive to criminal behaviour - it can encourage the formation of gangs which can then perpetuate crime even after inmates are released. Furthermore, apart from promoting criminality in the prison, mass incarceration also has a negative impact on the surrounding communities. Children of incarcerated parents tend to have poorer academic and social outcomes, and are more likely to be imprisoned themselves in future. This is especially prevalent in low-income minority communities. Therefore, prisons can only be considered effective if they prevent overcrowding and the spread of criminal networks within prisons, and if they are able to mitigate the negative impact of mass incarceration on surrounding communities.\nIn conclusion, the effectiveness of prisons in addressing the problem of crime is contingent on whether prisons are able to address the root causes of crime, whether resources are diverted towards rehabilitation, whether prisons maintain a small critical size, and whether they are able to mitigate the impact that mass incarceration has on communities. If these criteria are met, then prisons can be effective in deterring future crime. However, if these criteria are not met, then prisons can serve to perpetuate crime and exacerbate social inequalities.",
                "has a shockingly high recidivism rate. This shows that investment in resources for rehabilitation within prisons is a key factor in determining its effectiveness in addressing the problem of crime.\nThe size of the prison system and the effect that mass incarceration has on communities is another factor that determines the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime. When prisons become too crowded, the prison environment loses its rehabilitative potential and only becomes a breeding ground for criminal activities. Moreover, the long-term psychological effects of imprisonment on individuals, their families, and their communities are often negative. The heightened surveillance, constant threat of violence, and the stigmatization associated with imprisonment exacerbate social inequality, increase poverty, and can lead to high levels of community violence and criminality. This means that a small critical size for prisons must be maintained to ensure that prisons can fulfill their rehabilitative function and not destabilize communities.\nIn conclusion, prisons can be effective in addressing the problem of crime only if they are able to address the root causes of crime, divert resources to rehabilitation, maintain a small critical size and not destabilize communities. While it is undeniable that prisons play a crucial role in maintaining law and order, it is also important to recognize their limitations in addressing the complex social and economic issues that contribute to crime. Therefore, investing in community-based alternatives to imprisonment, improving access to education, healthcare and social services for communities, and creating economic opportunities for vulnerable populations are important strategies that can be pursued alongside, or even instead of, incarceration to reduce crime rates in the long term.",
                ", has some of the highest recidivism rates in the world.\nAnother factor contributing to the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime is critical size. Prisons must maintain a small critical size to prevent criminal networking and to limit the capacity for gangs to form. Overcrowding, which is prevalent in many prisons across the world, can promote the formation of criminal networks and tribes within prisons. A Prison Insider report reveals that in some prisons in Brazil, for instance, there are 230 prisoners for every 100 available places, leading some prisoners to sleep, defecate and eat in shifts.\nFinally, prisons must be mindful of the impact that mass incarceration has on communities. Over-dependence on prisons as a solution to crime can have detrimental effects on communities, particularly on marginalized ones, where there is already a lack of resources for criminogenic needs such as mental health care, education or job opportunities. Mass incarceration not only disrupts the social fabric of such communities, but it also contributes to income disparities and can contribute to the perpetuation of generational poverty cycles and social disengagement.\nIn conclusion, the efficacy of prisons depends on how they are managed and executed. While prisons can mitigate crime by deterring sex offenders, when prison sentences match offense, prioritizing rehabilitation, maintaining a small critical size to prevent criminal networking, and avoiding mass incarceration. Communities, too, must work towards addressing the root causes of crime, including poverty and social inequality, by providing marginalized communities the resources they need to grow and thrive and not rely on prisons as the sole means of crime reduction.",
                "fail to rehabilitate. \n\nThe effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime also depends on their size and ability to maintain control within their walls. If prisons become overcrowded, then they may degenerate into breeding grounds for criminal gangs and drug trafficking syndicates. The prevalence of gangs in prisons perpetuates and magnifies criminal networks within communities when convicts are released. For example, the Los Angeles County Jail in America is considered a \"super-spreader hub\" for COVID-19, but is also notorious for its gang activity, with at least 400 active gangs having been documented as operating within the prison walls. Ultimately, the problem of overcrowding is most pronounced in countries with mandatory minimum sentences or harsh sentencing guidelines. These measures can lead to prison populations surging without improving the capacity to address the root problems. \n\nMoreover, the impact of mass incarceration extends beyond prisons, with severe collateral damages inflicted on communities, especially those that are low-income and racialized. While prisons concentrate groups that are often neglected, chronically unemployed, or underemployed in the labour market, in the long run, incarceration perpetuates a vicious cycle of poverty and exclusion. Imprisonment often separates children from parents, in turn leading to failure in school, dysfunctional families, prolonged welfare dependency, and further criminalisation. The effect is especially harsh on communities of colour and minority groups, who are disproportionately incarcerated and harmed by the justice system in many countries. \n\nIn conclusion, prisons can be effective in addressing the problem of crime if they focus on rehabilitating convicts, are of manageable size to prevent the continuation of criminal networks, and do not disproportionately harm communities they are supposed to serve. While imprisonment is still central to many criminal justice policies, the alternatives have begun to offer more hopeful avenues. For instance, implementing programmes like community service, mental health counselling, vocational training for inmates, or early intervention for at-risk youth shows more promising results in reducing crime and the human and social cost of incarceration.",
                "has a much higher recidivism rate.\nPrisons are also only effective in addressing the problem of crime if resources are diverted to rehabilitation. While the prison system may seem like a necessary evil, prisons need to also focus on rehabilitating inmates into becoming productive members of society. This could take the form of therapy, job training, or education. By providing resources that will help these prisoners reintegrate into society after their release, society as a whole benefits from having fewer repeat offenders. However, without these resources, prisoners will likely continue to commit crimes out of necessity or desperation, perpetuating the problem and making prisons ineffective tools in dealing with crime.\nPrisons are also only effective if they maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks. Prisons inevitably become environments that foster criminal behaviours, given the high concentration of offenders that are housed together. However, when prisons reach a certain size, the ability for staff to regulate the conduct of prisoners diminishes. In this regard, smaller jails with a lower staff-to-prisoner ratio may be more effective in promoting a healthy and safe environment for rehabilitation and reintegration.\nLastly, prisons are only effective if they are able to mitigate the impact that mass incarceration has on communities. The disproportionate effect that the prison system has on communities of color in particular has been widely documented. Imprisonment takes a toll on the families and communities left behind, as they face a loss of income and support, as well as social stigma. A criminal record additionally has long-term implications, making it challenging for ex-offenders to obtain jobs or housing. Effective measures to mitigate the impact of mass incarceration on families include allowing for increased visitation, offering prisoners work-release options, and providing reentry programs that can help individuals reintegrate after they are released.\nIn conclusion, prisons are only effective in addressing the problem of crime if they focus on rehabilitation, direct resources toward reforming inmates, maintain a small critical size, and mitigate the impact of mass incarceration on families and communities. Reimagining the prison system as one that prioritizes reform over punishment is necessary in effectively addressing the problem of crime in society."

Additionally, prisons can have a detrimental effect on the mental health of inmates and lead to depression, anxiety, and other mental health concerns.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons may be a necessary tool to address the problem of crime, but their effectiveness depends on the availability of effective rehabilitation programs. Prisons that focus on rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders are more likely to reduce recidivism rates compared to those that do not. Therefore, governments and authorities must prioritize rehabilitation programs in correctional facilities and ensure adequate preparation of inmates for life after imprisonment to reduce criminal behavior and promote a more just and equal society.",

Instead, governments should invest in education, job creation, and social services to address these fundamental issues that cause crime.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons play a significant role in addressing crime by deterring individuals from committing criminal activities and rehabilitating offenders into society. However, this effectiveness can be hindered by factors such as a lack of rehabilitation programs and socioeconomic issues that lead to crime. Therefore, governments should invest in programs that target the root causes of crime, rather than solely relying on incarceration.",
                "the environment of prisons encourages further criminal activity, as inmates may become involved in gangs and other illegal activity in order to survive or maintain their status.\n\nAnother issue with prisons as a solution to the problem of crime is the high cost. Maintaining a prison system requires significant funding from taxpayers, and the cost of imprisonment has been increasing steadily in many countries. The use of alternative forms of punishment, such as community service and restorative justice, have been found to be more cost-effective while also reducing recidivism rates.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons have a role to play in addressing the problem of crime. They can serve as a deterrent to potential offenders, but this effectiveness is limited without the provision of rehabilitation programs. The prison system should be reformed to focus on not only punishing offenders but also rehabilitating them to reduce recidivism rates. Alternative forms of punishment should also be considered to ensure that the cost of punishing offenders does not outweigh the benefits.",
                "inmates are exposed to gang activities and drug abuse. This creates a situation where they become institutionalized, further entrenching their criminal behaviors and values.\n\nMoreover, the prison system is often overcrowded, and inmates may face harsh living conditions, which can exacerbate the problem. For example, due to overcrowding, it may be challenging to provide adequate medical care or provide enough food for the inmates. These conditions can lead to tensions among inmates, often resulting in violence.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons are essential in addressing the problem of crime. However, their effectiveness depends on how they are structured and managed. Prisons that offer rehabilitation programs are more effective in addressing crime as they provide inmates with a chance to acquire skills that are beneficial to society. On the other hand, prisons that do not offer rehabilitation programs are not effective in addressing crime, as they fail to address the root cause of criminal behavior. Therefore, policymakers must reform the prison system to ensure that the facilities are conducive to rehabilitation and do not perpetuate criminal behavior.",
                "offenders leave prison worse than they were before their imprisonment. This increases the likelihood of recidivism, and the cycle of crime continues.\n\nMoreover, the prison system has been criticized for perpetuating social and economic inequality. Incarceration rates are disproportionately high among individuals from low-income households and communities of color. This leads to the creation of a vicious cycle of poverty and crime, where individuals who have been incarcerated face challenges accessing education and job opportunities, making it difficult for them to reintegrate into society. As a result, the likelihood of recidivism is higher among these populations.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons play a crucial role in addressing the problem of crime. Imprisonment can serve as a deterrent for criminal activities, but it is not effective in reducing recidivism rates. Correctional facilities that offer rehabilitation programs are more effective in reducing recidivism rates. However, the prison system has to address systemic issues such as social and economic injustice to increase the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime.",
                "the conditions in prisons are so appalling with overcrowding, poor hygiene, and inadequate medical facilities that they foster anger and resentment towards the justice system, increasing the likelihood of re-offending.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons are a crucial part of the criminal justice system, contributing to punishment and deterrence. However, their effectiveness in addressing the problem of crime is limited if they do not take a rehabilitative approach. To improve the prison system's efficacy, policymakers must increase funding for education and vocational programs for inmates. This approach would equip prisoners with the necessary skills needed to re-enter society, reduce their reliance on criminal activities, and, ultimately, reduce recidivism rates.",
                "inmates experience physical and emotional abuse, which could further push them towards engaging in criminal activities. Furthermore, the prison system often fails to address the roots of criminal behavior such as mental health disorders, drug addiction, and poverty.\n\nMoreover, there are concerns about the effect of the prison system on society as a whole. Imprisonment has been shown to have economic and social impacts on families and communities. For instance, the imprisonment of a primary breadwinner could result in financial instability and long-term poverty for their families.\n\nIn conclusion, while prisons serve a crucial role in society by punishing offenders, the effectiveness of imprisonment in addressing crime is debatable. The lack of rehabilitation programs in many correctional facilities has led to a cycle of recidivism, and the impacts of imprisonment go beyond offenders to families and communities at large. Hence, policymakers and stakeholders should focus on reforming the prison system by providing effective rehabilitation programs that cater to the unique needs of individual inmates. This would create a safer society for all.",
                "inmates may also be exposed to toxic prison cultures that glorify criminal activities and reject societal norms. In the absence of proper rehabilitation programs, inmates may become more entrenched in the criminal lifestyle, leading to the potential for a more significant threat to society upon release.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that the effectiveness of prisons in addressing crime depends on the availability of effective rehabilitation programs. Without such programs, the prison system serves to warehouse offenders and perpetuate criminal activities instead of reducing them. Therefore, policymakers must identify and implement effective rehabilitation programs that will reduce recidivism rates and bring offenders back to society positively. This renewed focus will help to address the root causes of crime and lead to a more significant reduction in the crimes committed, making society safer for all.",
                "prisons also exacerbate the problem of drug use and addiction among inmates.\n\nFurthermore, the prison system disproportionately affects certain minority groups and the economically disadvantaged. The over-representation of these groups in the prison system suggests that the criminal justice system is flawed, and the prison system exacerbates existing societal inequalities.\n\nIn conclusion, prisons can be effective in addressing the problem of crime if they include comprehensive rehabilitation programs that support former inmates to reintegrate into society. The current system emphasizes punishment without addressing the root cause of criminal activities, leading to a cycle of recidivism. Therefore, policymakers should consider investing in rehabilitation and community-based alternatives to reduce the reliance on prisons as a way of addressing crime.",
                "the prison environment creates a sense of hopelessness that could lead to the development of criminal tendencies. Moreover, overcrowding, violence, and abuse within the prison facility could make an offender's situation worse, leading to the development of further criminal tendencies.\n\nIn conclusion, while prisons remain an essential component of the criminal justice system, their effectiveness in addressing crime depends on various factors. While deterrence is one of the primary goals of imprisonment, rehabilitation is equally important in reducing recidivism and preventing individuals from engaging in further criminal activities. Thus, the prison system needs to provide adequate resources and facilities to ensure that offenders get the necessary rehabilitation and educational programs."

            "prompt": "DOES GLOBAL AID REALLY IMPROVE THE LIVES OF THOSE WHO NEED IT THE MOST?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "re, with recipients\" lives being improved in a tangible sense.\nYet, another major obstacle in foreign aid really impacting the lives of those in need are the very governments in charge of the aid-receiving countries. In many of these developing countries, corruption is rife and dishonest leaders would siphon the funds meant to help their countrymen for their own gain. A prime example of this is South Africa'spresident, Jacob Zuma, who spent a whopping US$16 million to do \"security updates\" to his house. In actuality, he had built a new swimming pool on his property and called it a \"fire protection device\", when the funds used for the project could have gone to help the South African community. Yet this preposterous situation is not a standalone case, as such cases are widely prevalent across the developing world. In Nepal, which suffers from poor governance and endemic corruption, the delivery of aid was delayed following the Gorkha Earthquake that hit the country in 2015. Isolated villages high up in the Himalayas were yet to be reached three weeks after the initial quake, increasing the potential for more deaths. Its reputation of corruption has also deterred aid, as donors are less willing to donate, ultimately impacting the innocent people affected by the quake. In this way, corrupt governments of aid-receiving countries inhibit the delivery of aid, using the resources for their own private benefit instead, which winds up hurting the people who actually need the aid.\nOn a societal level, excessive long-term aid can be damaging to the accountability systems of the country and cause a crutch mentality to develop. Whilst long-term aid in the aspects of education and healthcare can drastically improve the local systems, the reliance on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and external parties to deliver essential services to the community can reduce trust and power in the government. Moreover, since aid is fundamentally different from taxes, in that they do not come from people'sown pockets, they are less likely to demand accountability from the government, letting corruption slide and adopting a fatalistic attitude to the state of affairs of the country. The over-dependence on the private aid sector to deliver is exemplified in Nepal where the high incidence of corruption has led foreign aid funds to flow into NGOs and not the government, resulting in a brain drain in its civil service as civil servants leave the government sector to work for the better-funded private aid industry. This could pose a problem for the country in the long-term as the aid industry has to exit one day. On the difference between aid and taxes, behavioural economics indicates that people react differently to money that they perceive to be theirs, and money that they perceive to belong to others. A study by the University of Toronto and Chicago in which two groups of factory workers in China were given the same 80 yuan bonus, except that the first group was told that the bonus would be taken back if they failed to produce 10 units more of goods, while the second group was told they would be given the bonus afterwards if they produced 10 units more of goods. The results were surprising as one would expect given the same conditions, workers would work the same, yet the first group worked harder than the second. This effect is due to loss aversion, which would account for the nonchalant attitudes many people in the developing world have towards corruption cases since they do not pay taxes and the funds embezzled are coming from foreign aid. They simply do not care since the money is not theirs, and hence demand less accountability from the government. In the long-run, this could be detrimental for the governance of the country as leaders have more freedom, allowing them to act in selfish ways without the risk of being voted out of office by the public. It is thus evident that over-dependence on foreign aid can have long-term consequences on the economy and political state of countries.\nIn conclusion, while the aid industry is reshaping to be more results-driven to have real impacts on people who need it the most, it remains motivated by the selfish gains of the leaders giving and receiving the aid who each have their own agendas. Ultimately, the ones who do not stand to benefit and even suffer from these transactions are those who so desperately need the aid. While the current state of affairs for foreign aid may seem bleak, the shift in the aid ministry to compete for good results instead of mere good intentions may hopefully alleviate the situation, bringing us closer to solving the problems plaguing the needy.",

Additionally, there are concerns regarding the accountability and transparency of aid distribution, which can lead to corruption and misuse of funds. Moreover, aid can create a dependency, leading to a decline in self-reliance and self-sufficiency. Furthermore, some aid can be tied, meaning that countries that receive aid must purchase specific products or services from donor countries, leading to a decline in the local market.\n\nFurthermore, global aid can also have unintended consequences. One of the primary concerns is the impact on the local economy and industry. Importing goods and products from donor countries can lead to a decline in the local market, making it difficult for local businesses to compete. Additionally, some aid can be short-term and unsustainable, leading to a decline in development after the aid has ceased. Furthermore, aid can also lead to a cultural decline, as the imported products and lifestyles change the traditional values of the local population.\n\nIn conclusion, while global aid has its advantages and disadvantages, the efficacy of global aid in improving the lives of those who need it the most depends on various factors, including the proper distribution and allocation of aid, transparency and accountability, long-term sustainability and self-sufficiency, and consideration of unintended consequences. It is also important to recognize that global aid cannot solve all of the problems faced by society's most marginalized sections. Ultimately, global aid should be viewed as a partnership between countries to achieve common goals, rather than a one-way relationship between donor and recipient countries. When done with care and diligence, global aid can play a critical role in improving the lives of those who need it the most.",

In a report by Oxfam, \"The Perfect Storm\", they showed that international aid given to Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake created a chronic dependence on aid that is now hampering the country's long-term development. Aid workers, often paid in foreign currency and living in compounds, drove up the cost of living on an island where many were already struggling. Aid money was often spent on imported goods that could have been purchased locally, encouraging import dependency over the development of native industries. In essence, aid has prevented local businesses from growing and improving the standard of living for the people there, instead pacifying them temporarily with gifts which they themselves could have acquired if given the chance. What should have been done instead was to empower the local people to rebuild their own country by giving them immediate access to money in the form of microfinance. By having a stake in the development of their own country, these individuals feel as though they own the respective solution, and act upon it more passionately and effectively. If aid is given directly to the people, economic growth could be triggered, thus improving the lives of the recipients much more effectively.\nIn conclusion, global aid does not always improve the lives of those who need it the most, especially when it involves ulterior motives. Nonetheless, the current shift from humanitarian to results-driven aid makes it more likely for aid to actually help those in need. But even without such motivations, aid provided may not necessarily improve the lives of those in need.

For instance, charity organizations like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the World Vision International have partnered with governments and local organizations in developing countries to provide assistance that contributes to a sustainable future. Through funding medical research, programs aimed at eradicating disease, building schools, providing access to clean water and sanitation, distributing food, and providing education, these organizations have been able to make lasting changes in the lives of people in developing countries. These changes, when properly executed, lead to progress and improved conditions for people living in poverty. It is essential to note that the aid provided needs to be well-planned and specific to the needs of the recipient country. When aid is given in a way that is culturally and community-sensitive, and recognizes the individual needs of a community, it has the potential to create significant and long-lasting change for those in need. Therefore, global aid, when given with genuine empathy and a focus on the betterment of the life of those that need it the most, can indeed affect positive change and improve the lives of those living in poverty.",

As we strive towards a more selfless and compassionate way of providing foreign aid, we must be mindful of our intentions and ensure that our actions truly benefit those in need.

Whether or not aid helps the situation, is determined by the reasons it is given and the way it is given. Donor governments often give aid, not as a gift, but as a trade to advance certain interests, thus, reducing the actual aid received. However, the idea of helping to prevent problems from reaching the donor country may be enough incentive for them to provide aid that produces results, though it may take time for such a paradigm shift in the aid industry to take place.

            "human_gen_truncate": " gives us the time to chase after the things that truly matter in life, be it fulfilment from pursuing one'spassions or quality time with loved ones. This is grounded on the premise that the meaning of life is derived from diverse experiences and memories. With a longer runway, those who live longer have more opportunities to indulge in these experiences. Additionally, a longer lifetime enables people to contribute to society more. Take the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who died at the tender age of 35. His greatest works include \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" and \"Rondo Alla Turca\" which are widely enjoyed and studied by many even till today, more than 200 years after they were first composed. Had he lived a longer life, he would have undoubtedly been able to contribute many more great classical pieces to mankind. It is clear that longer life expectancy gives us the chance to experience a happier and more meaningful life all while contributing more to society.\nThat said, a longer life does not necessarily equate to a more meaningful life, as many people spend their twilight years battling debilitating diseases, live in loneliness or even having to work till the very last second just to feed themselves. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study found that while global life expectancy is 73 years, that of healthy life expectancy is only 63, meaning that on average, people spend 10 years living in less than ideal health. This concept of years living in less than ideal health is succinctly captured in \"Years Lived with Disability (YLDs)\". In other words, while one may technically live a longer life, it may not be any better as the years spent living with a disease, living on medication on a daily basis, shuttling between home and the hospital or even hospitalized for long periods are much worse. Loneliness is also another factor that could significantly reduce the quality of life for the aged, as they may not have friends or family to rely on. As discussed earlier, \"kodokushi\" in Japan is a phenomenon that was borne out of the rising life expectancy coupled with several other factors. Many of the victims of \"kodokushi\" are corporate workers who did not have many friends or family outside of work. Retirement, instead of giving them time to live a more fulfilling life, plunged them into isolation as they were removed from the corporate world. The loneliness and despair could have played a role leading up to their eventual deaths, with no one caring enough to visit them in life or death. The elderly poor are also subject to a lower quality of life as they have to work tirelessly, often in menial jobs just to make ends meet. This is particularly prevalent in South Korea, where elderly poor will \"work until they die\". They say, \"I\"ll take care of myself as long as I can \u2026 then I\"ll go to the hospital and die.\" Some scour the streets to pick up recyclables and waste paper, lugging some 100 kilograms of waste for a whole day to the junk depot in exchange for less than 10,000 KRW. Others work in less savoury jobs as elderly prostitutes known as \"Bacchus ladies\", soliciting in parks and plazas for a measly pay as well. South Korea sure sits near the top of life expectancy rankings at 82.7 years, but the bitter fates that more than half of the elderly population endures raises the question if it is a fate worse than death. Thus, it is painfully obvious that long bitter lives spent in ill health, isolation and hardship may be even worse than death.\nTaking a more philosophical approach, living forever would be meaningless in the long run. Death, paradoxically, gives life the meaning which we all seek. The literal deadline gives urgency to everything we do in life, forcing us to work with a sense of purpose, perhaps to leave behind a legacy, something that is again only possible in death. The hypothetical proposition of eternal life would bore us to death and cause Man to lapse into laziness, cynicism and self-servitude. On the contrary, the fact that we will only exist on this Earth for a mere couple of decades motivates us to live with more drive and zeal, rather than whiling our time away. Acts of nobility, self-sacrifice and creativity are borne out of the knowledge that our time here is finite. In this way, increasing life expectancy taken to the extreme is undesirable and life would be forfeited of any meaning.\nIn essence, while increased life expectancy may indicate healthy economic growth and good public welfare systems for the nation, it also puts pressure on those very systems, creating a plethora of problems for the national economy. On a personal level, though it affords us the chance to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life, it is also capable of making life more miserable than death. Moreover, philosophically, an endless life would be meaningless. Perhaps, if we lived shorter lives more saturated in meaning instead, fewer of us will end up dying alone and decomposing in our own filth.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " healthcare and medical advancements ensures that everyone can benefit from these improvements. Longer life expectancy levels the playing field for certain groups of people who previously could expect to live a shorter life than others based on socioeconomic status. In this way, increasing life expectancy promotes social equality and eliminates health disparities.\n\nFinally, longer life expectancy means that people have more time to enjoy their retirement and experience all that life has to offer. Individuals can spend more time with family and friends, travel, volunteer, and pursue their passions. Organizations such as AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) enrich the lives of the elderly by providing opportunities for social interaction, healthcare, and financial advice. Longer lives give seniors more time to give back to society through volunteering or mentorship, which promotes social harmony and community.\n\nDespite the benefits of increased life expectancy, some argue that there are downsides to people living longer. The most prominent argument is the increasing need for social welfare programs. As people live longer, the elderly comprise a more significant proportion of society, and they require more resources to ensure they are healthy and living a decent life. This requires an increase in funding for social welfare programs, such as public health care, public pensions, and affordable housing.\n\nIn conclusion, the goal of increasing life expectancy is desirable. Longer life expectancy translates into a higher quality of life, economic growth, social equality, and community engagement. We should continue to strive for a lengthier, healthier life for everyone, to ensure that individuals have the best chance to live life to the fullest. Additional investment in healthcare, medical research, and welfare programs will promote longer life expectancy while ensuring that the elderly live a dignified life. By pursuing this goal, we can improve our society\u2019s overall wellbeing and promote social harmony.",

For example, conditions such as dementia, Alzheimer's disease, and other age-related ailments can rob a person of their mental and physical faculties, leading to a diminished quality of life. This may cause more suffering for both the individual and their family members, making the goal of increasing life expectancy less desirable.\nMoreover, while extending life may seem like a desirable goal, an endless life may lose its meaning. If one could live forever, there would be no urgency to do things and make the most of the time we have. Life would be without end, and ultimately without purpose, which may lead to feelings of stagnation and hopelessness.

In some cases, increased life expectancy may merely prolong the suffering of those afflicted with illnesses and diseases, leading to a poor quality of life for both themselves and their caregivers. Additionally, an excessive focus on longevity may give rise to a culture where people obsess over living longer, without considering the quality of life they lead or the impact of their actions on others. This could lead to an unfavourable societal shift where people become hesitant to take risks or venture out of their comfort zones for fear of endangering their longevity, which could consequently result in a duller and less creative society. As such, we need to consider the trade-offs between a longer life with potentially greater opportunities, and the possible sacrifices that have to be made in order to achieve this. \n\nIn conclusion, while the goal of increasing life expectancy seems desirable at first glance, it may not always be so due to the associated costs, both on an individual and societal level. While a longer life may provide individuals with greater opportunities and experiences, there are also costs associated with it, such as increased healthcare expenditure and potential disinterest in taking risks or living a fulfilling life.

Furthermore, having a long life may not mean having better quality of life, as many elderly people face physical and mental illnesses that come along with old age, which may be painful and difficult to bear. Therefore, while a longer life may allow for more time to experience the joys of life, it may not necessarily equate to a meaningful or even fulfilling one.\nIn conclusion, while increasing life expectancy may seem like an appealing goal economically and personally, it is not without its downsides. The strain on government finances and public healthcare infrastructure, as well as the potential loss of meaning in an ever-extending life may render the goal less desirable.

They may also become more susceptible to chronic diseases and ailments, a burden on their own quality of life and those around them. As such, a longer life may not always be desirable and must be considered on a case-by-case basis given individual circumstances.\nPhilosophically, an endless life may render life meaningless. The fear of death is universal and drives us to make the most out of the limited time we have. If life were to be prolonged indefinitely, be it through genetic advancements or technological breakthroughs, we may begin to question the purpose and value of our existence. The knowledge that we have forever to live may lead to a carefree and reckless lifestyle, causing us to lose sight of our responsibilities and duties. This will also lead to a decrease in the sense of urgency and appreciation of life's little moments that make it so meaningful. As such, a shorter yet fulfilling life may be more desirable than a longer life without purpose or meaning.\nIn conclusion, while increasing life expectancy may seem desirable at first glance, there are also a multitude of factors that need to be considered.

Life expectancy in Singapore has increased steadily over the years, with the current life expectancy standing at 83 years. In fact, it has increased by over 10 years since the 1960s. This can be attributed to better healthcare, access to medicine and a better standard of living for all Singaporeans. A longer and healthier life also leads to a better quality of life. Therefore, it is clear that, on a personal level, there are many benefits to having a longer life.\nFrom a philosophical perspective, however, a longer life may not always be ideal. Peter Kreeft argues that living forever would render life meaningless as there will always be more time to do things and no end goal in sight. We may never achieve true satisfaction or truly appreciate the moments we have in life because we will always be searching for something more. It is important for us to savour the moments in our life, and appreciate the time we have left. Therefore, we need to consider if a shorter but more fulfilling life is better.\nIn conclusion, while having a longer life expectancy may be desirable on a personal level, there are costs to having a longer life on society and governments. The quest for an increased life expectancy places more strain on healthcare systems and national budgets, prompting some to reconsider the goal of increasing it.

In such instances, a longer life may not necessarily be desirable, especially if it is accompanied by physical and emotional suffering. It is also worth noting that an endless life may render life meaningless. With limited time, individuals have a sense of urgency to achieve their goals and make the most out of their lives.

However, it is important to note that without a good quality of life, a longer life may not necessarily be desirable. This is seen in cases where elderly individuals may suffer from chronic diseases and disabilities, rendering them dependent on caregivers and unable to enjoy life to the fullest. Life expectancy, therefore, has to be complemented with a good quality of life to be truly desirable.\nPhilosophically, it can be argued that an infinite life may lead to life losing its meaning. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche proposed the concept of the 'eternal recurrence', positing that one would want to live the same life over and over again for an infinite amount of times. However, this concept also suggests that one must make the most out of every moment, as every moment will recur forever. A longer life may create the possibility for one to fulfil this philosophy, but it may also make it difficult for individuals to see the value in living every moment to the fullest when they have an infinite amount of time. This may lead to a nihilistic worldview, whereby life loses its meaning altogether as the value of time loses its urgency.\nIn conclusion, the goal of increasing life expectancy may have its benefits, but it is not always desirable. A long life may come at the cost of putting a strain on a country's healthcare infrastructure and national finances, while also raising philosophical questions on the meaning of life. A good quality of life is also essential for a longer life to be truly desirable. Ultimately, life is about balance and is subjective to one's own beliefs and experiences."

            "human_gen_truncate": "n after work hours. This further skews the work-life balance, allowing work to pervade into our private lives, making it harder to parent children. Clearly, juggling work and raising children at the same time is a feat in itself, making good parenting harder in the modern world.\nAnother reason that parenting may be harder today than ever is the existence of the omnipresent mass media which directly promotes ideas that parents may not approve of. As discussed in the previous paragraph, due to parents being mentally absent, parents usually toss some form of a mobile device, usually a mobile phone or tablet to young children to pacify them. In an instant, children'swails and cries are silenced by the brightly coloured screens that captivate their attention. While parents might love this quick fix solution, it could prove to have long-lasting repercussions unbeknownst to them. When parents set children'sentertainment like \"Finger Family Song\" or \"Surprise Egg\" reveals to play on YouTube, they usually do not realise the autoplay function on the platform which allows related videos to stream continuously. The creators of these videos have realised this function though and some of them have exploited this function by algorithmically creating mashups of familiar cartoon characters in violent situations. James Bridle, an artist and writer dealing primarily with technology, knowledge and the end of the future, examined this issue in his TED Talk entitled \"The nightmare of childrens\" YouTube\". He notes that these videos \"exploit and terrify young minds\". In our world today, where parents toss their children down the spiral of mutated, terrifying cartoons, it is hard to argue that parents today are good parents at all. For older kids, themes of sex, violence and substance abuse are promoted repetitively in the mass media as risk-free, harmless and even cool. These ideas typically do not align with what most parents would advocate in their families, yet children are constantly exposed to such material, perhaps due to parents\" negligence in monitoring what their children watch. Evidently, good parenting today is more difficult due to the dangers that threaten children'ssafety lurking everywhere online.\nDespite all that have been discussed, the most crucial question has yet to be addressed: What is good parenting? As times change, expectations of parents have evolved in tandem. Parents in the past could get away with a laidback child-rearing approach in line with the slower pace of living of the time, yet that same parenting style applied today would never fly. Parents today are expected to be more involved in their children'slives, especially in their academics. This rings true for many young Singaporean children who have had to grow up under \"tiger mums\" and \"helicopter parents\". Parents today take on multiple hats for their children, including chauffeuring their children from enrichment class after enrichment class and being a personal tutor who monitors children do homework. It is clear that the very definition of a good parent has radically changed. While it is easy to pin the blame on overly competitive parents for piling enrichment classes, assessment books and stress on their young children, we must first examine the situation from the parents\" perspectives. Parents face more stress than ever to birth valedictorians, scholars or just successful (by society'sdefinition) children. This can be attributed to the abundance of parenting resources, discussed earlier, that tell parents they have to do this or do that or else they are not providing the very best for their children and that they are \"bad parents\". This causes parents to act in adverse ways, transferring the pressure on them to be \"good parents\" unto their children to be \"successful\". Therefore, with the bar to be a \"good parent\" set so ridiculously high, who can safely claim to be a \"good parent\"?\nTo conclude, good parenting is hard to define but the standard to be considered a good parent has undoubtedly been raised over the past few decades. Parents now also have to wrestle with the mass media that threatens to corrupt their children'sminds, while juggling longer work hours at the same time. It certainly is a feat to raise children today but other parties like the government and the Internet have offered some consolation in the arduous road of parenthood. The Internet'sready abundance of parenting resources and forums would definitely prove useful to parents at every stage, while the government'sliberal financial help to defray the cost of raising children certainly help alleviate the factor of cost, associated with raising children here in the most expensive city in the world. Despite these, it must be admitted that good parenting in Singapore is indeed more challenging today than ever before.",

Often, what is displayed online ranges from unrealistic standards of beauty to social behavior standards that don't align with typical family values. The peer pressure can create a barrier between parents and their children that\u2019s almost impossible to break, leading to a gap in understanding between the two.\n\nAnother challenge which nowadays is heavily influenced by societal changes is the development of children's mental health. We previously did not regard children's mental health as a significant concern, but today, things have changed. Children's anxiety, depression, and suicidal thoughts have risen because of multiple factors, like the lack of communication, pressure from academic success and the general stresses of modern life. A child\u2019s fundamental harmony is crucial to their academic, social, and personal accomplishments, and therefore, parents should be active in addressing issues of mental health.\n\nFinally, as a society, we have become increasingly competitive, and parents are often judged based on the achievements of their children. This can lead to undue pressure on both parents and children to attain perfect grades, attend elite schools and extracurricular activities. While forcing children to achieve is not new, the competitiveness of our society today creates unrealistic expectations, which is unhealthy for everyone involved.\n\nIn conclusion, it is essential to acknowledge that good parenting is becoming more challenging in our society today.

The internet, social media, and various entertainment sources make it easier for children to engage in unhealthy behaviors like cyberbullying and gaming addictions, which can have negative impacts on children's physical and mental health.\nIn conclusion, good parenting is certainly more challenging in Singapore today, despite the government's efforts to provide subsidies and grants for parents. While parenting resources like the internet have made it easier for parents to access information and seek help, technological advancements have also created new challenges like mass media and the blurring of work and private life. To overcome these challenges, parents should prioritize spending quality time with their children and build a supportive network of family and friends. It is clear that being a good parent is one of the most difficult jobs in the world and will no doubt continue to be so in the future as society evolves.",
                "n outside of working hours, effectively encroaching on their private time. This leaves little time for family bonding or even for resting. Children today are increasingly demanding of their parents' time and attention with more extracurricular activities and homework. Thus, the limited quality time parents have with their children is divided with multiple priorities. As a result, the time spent with the child may not be adequate or fulfilling, a source of frustration and guilt for the parents. This often leads to parents feeling inadequate and their children feeling neglected. This sense of neglect can lead to delinquency among children who feel ignored by their parents, thus perpetuating a vicious cycle. Hence, in a fast-paced city like Singapore, where time is money, it seems that the challenge of good parenting has become more difficult than before.\nMoreover, media influence complicates the job of parenting for many parents. Children today are exposed to an overwhelming amount of inappropriate content at a younger age, thanks to the omnipresent influence of mass media. Cartoons that teach themviolence and games that glorify aggressive behaviour, have become more easily accessible on all screens. In a world where the Internet is ubiquitous, there is no way to completely shield children from such content, and even the most careful parents can falter. The percolation of such content into their daily lives may lead to desensitisation, and they may find violence or abusive behaviours acceptable or even entertaining. Other less obvious media influences can also be seen in celebrity culture where it has become so pervasive that it defines what is accepted as the norm in society, and children emulate everything that they see, including negative behavior. This can have a lasting impact on the way children view themselves and how they relate to the world. By extension, such media exposure makes it harder for parents to instill values in their children, leaving them confused in an uncertain world. Thus, media proliferation has made parenting more challenging than ever before.\nIn conclusion, I believe that whilst there are more resources available for good parenting in today's society, the challenges that parents face are also greater, and experienced across a wider spectrum of socio-economic and technological barriers. Parents today have to juggle between giving their children a sufficient amount of quality time with the limited hours they have, filtering out negative influences from the media and coaching them in life skills to survive in an increasingly competitive world. The demands of modern society on parenting are such that a good parent is one capable of balancing these competing priorities and still establish a deep emotional connection with their child. With the uncertainty of what lies ahead, only time will tell how human ingenuity can be channeled to help good parents rise to these challenges.",
                "n outside of work hours, adding to the burden of working parents with little free time to themselves.\nAdditionally, mass media has been cited by some as a contributing factor to the challenges in parenting. Children nowadays are more exposed to a wide range of contents, both good and bad, and it is hard for parents to control everything their children see and hear. Social media measurements for instance have been seen to be a source of stress for young people, causing some parents heightened anxiety as their young ones lay their lives bare for the world to see. Vidya Schalk, a clinical psychologist in Singapore, commented that social media creates unrealistic expectations for both parents and children that can weigh heavily on mental health and well-being. Therefore, the pressure of being the perfect parent and raising the perfect child may lead to emotional distress and burnout for parents in this highly competitive society.\nAll in all, while the proliferation of government policies and the Internet have eased the financial and informational burdens of raising children, the amount of time and attention parents today spend on their children has been decreasing. This paradoxical situation has contributed to almost a sense of heightened anxiety among parents as they navigate in this increasingly competitive and digitised world. Hence, good parenting is indeed increasingly challenging in my society today and as we move forward, it will be crucial to find ways to balance the demands of work and parenting, while still ensuring healthy social and emotional development of our future generations.",

With work demands creeping into family time, parents might feel guilty for not spending enough time with their children. This, in turn, leads to parents being more anxious over whether they have done enough, and a sense of exhaustion from overcompensating for lost time. It is a vicious cycle. \n\nAnother challenge that parents face today is the omnipresent mass media. In the past, children only had television as the only form of media influence, but today's children are growing up in an era of screens - from smartphones to tablets, and to television. Our children are exposed to a barrage of media content every day. This 24/7 exposure to the internet and social media can bring a lot of harm if not controlled. The internet is, for all its advantages, home to a lot of negative content that can be extremely harmful for children. Media can also change the way children think and act, with some shows promoting behaviours you would not want your child to emulate. These pieces of the media can be a source of parental anxiety as one tries to navigate the complicated landscape of modern societal norms, ages of exposure, and overall danger. As such, parents may find it difficult to control their children's media consumption and need to be constantly vigilant to ensure that it is not causing harm.\n\nTo conclude, good parenting has become increasingly difficult in Singapore today. Though there are more resources available for parents to get professional guidance and financial assistance to provide for their children, today's parents struggle to find a balance between work and quality time with their children, and they are constantly combating the impact of mass media. Parenting will always be a challenging task, and it will always require time and patience. But by instilling a sense of discipline and structure and providing a nurturing and safe environment, parents can equip their children with the tools they need to tackle the challenges ahead.",

With such a rise in the demand for work, parents find it increasingly difficult to strike a balance between their work and family responsibilities. This has a significant impact on the quality of parenting that they are able to provide for their children. As such, good parenting in Singapore is more challenging than in the past.\nFurthermore, parents today are also contending with the omnipresent mass media, which compete for their children's attention. Children are now exposed to a wide range of media from a very young age, and parents are finding it difficult to limit and control the impact it has on their children. Children are now spending more time online and are exposed to social media, which can lead to them being distracted from their homework, imitating negative behaviours seen on YouTube or other platforms, and becoming more susceptible to cyberbullying. A 2019 study by the National Youth Council revealed that 92% of Singaporean youths aged between 15 and 29 own a smartphone and spend an average of 3.2 hours daily on social media platforms. As such, parents find themselves not only competing with work but with media for their children's time and attention, which makes good parenting even more challenging.\nIn conclusion, good parenting is increasingly challenging in Singapore today as parents have to contend with longer working hours, media distraction and the need to balance between work and personal life. While there are many government policies and parenting resources available online, these are not enough to offset the challenges that modern parents face in raising their children. Good parenting requires patience, time, effort and a willingness to learn and adapt, and it is important for all of us to recognize the difficult journey that parents go through to raise their children.",

This puts immense pressure on parents who work long hours, often making it difficult for them to strike a balance between family and work life.\nFurthermore, parents today also face the challenge of trying to raise a child in the age of social media and digital technology. With smartphones and iPads in almost every household, children are exposed to an endless supply of entertainment and information at their fingertips. While technology could be a great educational tool for children, it also exposes them to potential dangers such as inappropriate content and cyberbullying. In addition, social media has its own set of challenges. Parents nowadays have to constantly worry about their children being affected by online negativity, peer pressure, as well as unpleasant experiences such as cyberstalking and cyberbullying. All these challenges may prevent parents from being present for their children because these are issues that they have no control over.\nIn conclusion, it seems apparent that good parenting is increasingly challenging in Singaporean society today. While it is true that parents now have more financial aid, resources and tools at their disposal, many factors like long working hours and excessive use of digital technology have made parenting a more challenging role to play. The solution to this issue is not an easy one, but it is certainly one that parents need to grapple with.",

This trend shows no signs of stopping anytime soon, which will only further exacerbate the situation for Singaporean parents who are struggling to strike a balance.\nAdditionally, parents today have to contend with the omnipresent mass media which can make it difficult to control what their children are exposed to, influencing their behaviour and values. Social media, for example, exposes young children to all kinds of content that may not be suitable for their age or development stage. Television shows, celebrity culture and advertising also shape the views and perspectives of young children in ways that can be detrimental to their mental and emotional growth. Parents have to expend extra energy to steer their children in the right direction, being constantly vigilant to ensure they do not pick up negative habits or inappropriate values. Such media influences did not exist during the pre-Internet era, giving parents less to worry about in terms of media literacy. The challenges are even greater now with the rise of fake news and online scams that can make parenting in today's digital age feel like an uphill battle.\nIn conclusion, good parenting in Singapore society today is indeed challenging. While government policies have certainly eased the financial burden of new parents, the pressure to provide for children exists in other aspects, such as ensuring their appropriate cognitive and social development. The increasing demands of work and the blurring of lines between work and home life have led to parents having less quality time with their children. The rise of mass media has created a new set of challenges, where parents need to be vigilant about what their children are exposed to. Despite these difficulties, however, parents today have access to more information on how to raise their children right through the Internet. But even with all the help available, it still takes a lot of effort, time, and love to be a good parent in today's society.",

Long working hours can lead to parental stress and burnout, making it harder for parents to be effective parents. Moreover, the changing nature of work has led to some parents unable to financially care for their children, leading to social ills like child neglect and abuse.\nAnother challenge for parents today is the increasing role of mass media in the raising of children. In the past, the mass media consisted simply of newspapers, television, and radio with traditionally one-way communication at best. Now, the media is more diverse than ever before, with social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, as well as YouTube and web shows, all providing an endless stream of information and entertainment. While there is nothing inherently wrong with all of this media consumption, it can become overwhelming, especially for new parents who are scared of making mistakes in the raising of their children. The problem is further aggravated by social trends like keeping up with others and \"FOMO\" (fear of missing out). Parents may feel the need to keep up or meet society's expectations at the expense of spending quality time with their children, or worse, blindly following media entertainment at the cost of their children's safety or wellbeing.\nIn conclusion, good parenting in Singapore today is an increasingly challenging task. While there are more resources than ever before to help parents effectively raise their children, there are also obstacles such as longer working hours and mass media culture that can stand in the way. Ultimately, good parenting requires a balance of all factors: physical, emotional, and social. Whether it is through financial assistance, the Internet or balancing work and personal time, good parenting remains the key to raising healthy, well-adjusted children who will grow up to make meaningful contributions to society.",

Thus, parental involvement and quality time with children may be compromised, which can then lead to feelings of parental inadequacy and guilt for not being able to provide enough time and attention to their children. This can result in children feeling neglected and may adversely impact their mental health, leading to anxiety and depression.\nAside from work-life balance, another factor that makes parenting more challenging is the influence of the mass media. Children today are exposed to a constant barrage of media messages that can be harmful if not properly moderated. Children are often glued to their screens, and the Internet and television can offer mixed messages on what constitutes a healthy attitude and behaviour. Parents may have to battle the easy accessibility of violent or sexual content, body image issues, and cyberbullying. Parents must also keep up with the latest social networking platforms that their children are onto, to monitor their activities for potential harm. Also, as parenting psychologist Susan Newman pointed out, smartphones have brought with them dangers such as cyberbullying, sexting, and exposure to inappropriate content, all from the privacy of a child'sown room. Today'sparents, therefore, have the added responsibility of being well-educated about potential dangers and protecting their child'swelfare in this new digital realm.\nIn conclusion, I agree that good parenting is increasingly challenging in Singapore society today. While parenting has become easier in some ways with increased financial and educational assistance and easier access to parenting information, it has also become more challenging with the blurred lines between work and private life as well as the influence of the Internet and mass media. Today's parents have to juggle the demands of work with the needs of their children, and keep them protected in this increasingly complex and interconnected world.

This makes parenting more challenging today since children yearn for and need the presence of their parents more than ever before. Moreover, the omnipresence of mass media places more pressure on parents in today'ssociety. The widespread prevalence of social media has caused social norms to evolve rapidly, oftentimes putting pressure on parents to conform to standards that they may not agree with. For example, social media bombards parents with images of picture-perfect meals, immaculately clean and decorated homes, and children who are always well-behaved, well-presented, and involved in multiple activities. This can cause parents to experience unrealistic and unnecessary anxiety about how they raise their children. Furthermore, the ever-increasingly consumeristic society we live in today means that parents now need to spend more on their children in terms of toys, classes, and other materials, increasing the financial burden on parents, as well as putting unnecessary pressure on them.\nIn conclusion, good parenting in Singapore today is more challenging than ever before despite the availability of resources on the Internet and financial assistance schemes from the government. While these improvements have made certain areas of parenting easier, parents today face increasing work demands, less quality time with their children, the pressure from social media, and the rising cost of living. Therefore, parents who can master the balance between these demands and prioritize their child's needs, all whilst keeping reasonable expectations and not succumbing to social pressure, are those who can be the good or even the great parents that Singapore needs today."

From there, the Chinese agents start building a rapport with their targets and slowly convince them to hand over state secrets. The US is also a victim of Russia'suse of Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Presidential Election that saw the election of Donald Trump\u2014at the time perceived by Russia as their preferred candidate. Exacerbating these problems is the proliferation of \"fake news\", which many experts suspect not only influenced the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Election, but the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK as well. In Singapore, the government passed a new piece of legislation in 2019\u2014the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act\u2014proving that social media poses a serious enough challenge to governments hoping to protect their citizens from malicious content. Additionally, profit-oriented social media companies have a stronger interest in earning profits than adopting responsible behaviour. For instance, users are particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias as online algorithms detect users\" personal opinions based on their online behaviour, and upload relevant posts on their news feed accordingly. Since most people currently receive their daily news from social media platforms, this means that society may become more polarised. Therefore, the unregulated but highly populated \"Wild West\" of social media poses a huge, and likely difficult to solve, challenge for governments as dangerous information circulate widely and quickly among their citizens.\nThe challenges posed by social media to governments may be negligible if they provide them with substantial benefits; however, that is unlikely to be the case. Politicians may find social media useful in helping them directly communicate with their voters. This makes leaders closer to the ground and more relatable. An extreme case happened in Turkey in 2016, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan managed to survive a military coup by appealing to his supporters via a live stream on FaceTime. More typically, politicians use social media to upload photos of milestone events, inform followers of upcoming events, and have a direct line of communication with the public. However, their actions are also heavily scrutinised\u2014any misstep on social media, no matter how slight, could cost them politically. Social media now acts as a check and balance against the government\u2014something like a \"Fifth Estate\" or watchdog exposing governmental wrongdoings. For instance, in 2011, American congressman Anthony Weiner was forced to resign after a sexually suggestive photo he sent to a woman via Twitter was leaked to the public. With the ease in which misinformation can be spread through fabricated or outdated photos, or situations taken out of context, even the most honest and upright government would likely hold some reservations over the positive aspects of social media. Ultimately, most governments would conclude that social media ultimately poses a net challenge, and is largely a necessary evil that has to be managed.\nIn summary, social media is largely a challenge to government as a widely used by highly unregulated platform in which forces of disruption could spread like wildfire. Citizens may be driven to rise up against their leaders, or have their views distorted by outside propaganda. Such problems are threats to national security, and despite the benefits social media brings to governments in connecting with the people, it is safe to conclude that most governments rightly perceive social media as largely a threat that produces only some positive side effects.",

Social media has created an open platform where anyone can express themselves and share their views and ideas. This has made it difficult for the government to maintain control and has created a platform for dissenting views. Social media tools such as hashtags have allowed for the mobilization of people in ways that would not have been possible before. For example, during the Arab Spring in 2010-2011, social media played a critical role in the organization of mass protests that resulted in regime changes in various countries.\n\nFinally, social media has posed a challenge for the government in terms of cybersecurity. With the increase in social media usage, cybercriminals have become more active and adept at stealing sensitive information from individuals and organizations. Governments are also vulnerable to these threats, as hackers can gain access to sensitive government information, and use it for malicious purposes such as espionage and blackmail.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has created a range of challenges for governments around the world. From creating challenges in regulating content to giving rise to the spread of fake news, social media has posed multiple challenges that many governments are struggling to address. It is crucial for governments to find ways to manage these challenges by implementing policies that can regulate social media content and protect citizens' privacy and security.

While there are some measures in place to regulate the content being circulated online, they are unlikely to be very effective given the sheer volume of information available.

Given that social media is difficult to regulate, it is easy for foreign governments and non-state actors to use it as a tool of influence.\nThat said, governments have not been completely helpless in the face of these challenges. Many have developed legislation to regulate and criminalize certain types of online behavior, such as hate speech and cyberbullying. In Singapore, for example, the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) was introduced in 2019 to safeguard against the spread of misinformation online. This act allows the government to order online platforms to put up corrections to falsehoods, which could otherwise be used to create panic and sow discord among the public. Similarly, in Germany, the NetzDG law was introduced to combat hate speech and extremism online. However, critics of such measures argue that they could be used to stifle free speech and legitimate dissent, thereby raising concerns about governments' use of legal measures to clamp down on social media.\nIn short, the proliferation of social media has given rise to many challenges for governments around the world. From the threat of mass uprisings to the spread of dangerous ideas and the rise of foreign interference, social media represents a significant challenge in the modern age.

Anyone can set up a social media account and post anything without fact-checking or editorial oversight. This has led to instances of \"fake news\" which have influenced elections and inflamed political passions.

This is particularly worrying in countries that face risks of ethnic or religious conflicts, where fake news and rumours could lead to violence or riots.\nIn conclusion, social media poses a significant challenge to governments, albeit it also brings many benefits such as improved communication and community-building. Governments must remain vigilant and proactive in seeking ways to regulate social media to control the spread of fake news, mitigate risks to national security and law enforcement, and to maintain stability.

While governments are trying to find ways to deal with these challenges, they are faced with the reality that social media is likely to remain a powerful and sometimes unpredictable force for the foreseeable future.

This highlights the potential security threat that social media poses to a country, and the difficulty in regulating such threats when the social media platform operates internationally. \n\nIn conclusion, social media presents a significant challenge for governments as the increasing reliance on it by citizens for information and networking gives it the potential to be a platform for uncontrolled dissent or propaganda. Governments will need to think critically and creatively about how to engage with social media and use it for their benefit while regulating it in a way that balances the rights of free speech with state security. Success in this area will require significant technological sophistication, regulatory and legal frameworks and an awareness of the patterns in which citizens use social media, which may be ever-changing.",
                "o gather intelligence on foreign citizens. Through fake online profiles, Chinese agents were able to reach out to political figures and other influential people to gather information on them, and to steer the conversation in a direction that China preferred. This demonstrates how social media can be a tool for national security risk, as countries may use social media to infiltrate and gain access to sensitive information. \n\nIn conclusion, social media poses a challenge for governments in many ways. Its expansive nature, global reach and the lack of regulation creates a platform that could be used to spread misinformation or challenge the government's authority. It can also be used as a tool by terrorists groups to radicalise individuals, and by foreign governments to interfere in the domestic affairs of another nation. As social media continues to evolve and becomes more prevalent in our daily lives, governments need to find more effective ways to regulate and moderate its use for the greater good.",
                "o target American citizens who work in important technologies and industries, hoping to lure them back to China or obtain confidential information from them. The government could be challenged in its ability to screen or regulate social media, and this could lead to serious national security risks if sensitive information gets into the wrong hands.\nDespite these challenges, governments have taken measures to address the risks posed by social media. For instance, the Singapore government has enacted the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act (POFMA) in May 2019, in order to prevent falsehoods from being spread on social media and other online platforms. This enables the government to quickly refute falsehoods and correct inaccuracies so as to prevent the dissemination of untruths. Similarly, in the United States, the Department of Homeland Security has established a \u201csocial media unit\u201d to keep track of extremist content online. The unit analyses content on social media in order to identify and nip in the bud, signs of potential terrorist attacks. These protective measures are important in preventing serious consequences that could arise from misuse or misappropriation of social media.\nIn conclusion, the use of social media has led to novel and at times unpredictable challenges for governments. With growing concerns over the spread of fake news and the potential to create mass panic and incite violence, governments are under pressure to develop innovative policies and regulations to manage social media effectively. While the challenges posed by social media are certainly daunting, they are not insurmountable, and with continued vigilance and effort, governments could work towards overcoming these challenges and exploit the benefits of social media to foster good governance, civic engagement and social harmony.",
                "o recruit intelligence operatives from the US and Europe. Social media is also a breeding ground for hate speech, fake news and conspiracy theories, leading to polarization within society. This could lead to a divided country where a significant portion of the population may not align with the values and goals of the government. Given these challenges, it is understandable that governments may be wary of social media and its potential to cause harm.\nIn conclusion, social media poses a significant challenge to governments due to its widespread reach, unregulated nature, and potential to turn the population against their leaders. The use of social media as a platform for dangerous ideas and interference in another nation's affairs only serve to intensify that challenge. However, governments have a responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their citizens, and they cannot afford to ignore the power of social media. Regulating social media without impinging on the rights of its citizens is a delicate balance that governments would need to strike.",

Members of China's spy agencies were found to be posing as headhunters, consultants and think-tank experts on the platform with the intention of networking with foreign officials and elites. This shows how social media could be abused to promote hidden agendas and cause diplomatic tensions between nations.\nIn conclusion, social media indeed poses a significant challenge for governments as it could be used as a platform for organizing social and political movements, spreading hatred and dangerous ideas, and even as a means for foreign interference. While governments have started to enforce some regulations, the sheer volume of information and limitations of technological control means that social media remains a highly complex issue for governments to manage, and requires innovation on a larger scale to establish a more effective system to cope with the threat it presents.",

The report showed that China is using LinkedIn to find high-level individuals working in the US government and is offering them positions at prestigious Chinese universities or research facilities in exchange for trade secrets. The challenge for governments, therefore, is not only to prevent sensitive information from being leaked but also to prevent the use of social media as a vessel for foreign influence.\nHowever, the regulation of social media poses a different set of challenges for governments. Concerns have been raised about the infringement of rights to free speech and privacy if social media usage is heavily regulated. Regulating social media may also be seen as a method of suppressing dissenting voices, leading to public outcry. This was seen in India where the government passed the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules in May 2021. These rules gave the government the power to remove or block content that it deems to be misleading or harmful to the country's integrity. The Indian government also required social media companies to identify the \"first originator\" of messages, which critics argue could compromise user privacy and end-to-end encryption.\nIn conclusion, social media has unquestionably created a challenge for governments around the world. Social media usage allows people to share and access information which can challenge traditional sources of authority. It also presents a new avenue for foreign governments to interfere in other countries\u2019 affairs. However, regulating social media presents a different set of challenges and concerns over privacy and freedom of speech. Overall, governments will need to continue to evolve their strategies to address the challenges that social media poses."

This has put a lot of pressure on the government to address issues that are brought up on social media. In some cases, the government has been forced to take action against individuals or organizations due to public pressure on social media, even if they may not have taken similar actions in the absence of such pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has posed a significant challenge for the government. The extent to which it poses a challenge is vast and covers several areas, such as the spread of misinformation, regulation of content, and the rise of cancel culture.

The opinions of individuals on social media platforms can often influence the government's decision-making process. Public opinion is now expressed more vocally, openly, and frequently on social media. This can be both advantageous and disadvantageous. One the one hand, it can lead to the government being more accountable to the public. On the other hand, it can lead to the government making decisions based on popular opinion rather than what is in the best interest of the country.\n\nFinally, social media has given rise to cybercrime, which has become a challenge for governments around the world. Social media platforms often contain sensitive information such as personal details and financial information. This makes social media platforms an attractive target for cybercriminals who seek to extract such information. In addition, social media platforms can be used as means for committing criminal activities such as scams, phishing, and identity theft.\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that social media poses a significant challenge for governments. While social media has brought numerous benefits, it has equally brought challenges. To address these challenges, governments need to work with social media companies to promote responsible use of social media platforms.

For instance, during the Arab Spring, social media was used as a platform to mobilize protesters, which led to the overthrow of governments in several countries. Governments that are not able to monitor the activities of these groups may face difficulties in maintaining law and order.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has posed significant challenges for governments worldwide. From misinformation to the spread of hate speech, the lack of regulation of social media content has made it difficult for governments to keep their citizens safe.

This has created a need for the government to be more transparent and accountable in their decision-making processes.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has posed a significant challenge for the government. It has made regulation of content difficult, spread misinformation, and made it difficult to control the narrative. However, the solution to these challenges cannot be to clamp down on social media.

Additionally, social media can also be a tool for foreign influence on domestic politics, which can pose a severe threat to a country's national security.\n\nIn conclusion, social media has undoubtedly posed various challenges for the government. The widespread reach of social media platforms, coupled with the lack of regulation, has made it difficult for the government to maintain control over the information being spread. However, it is essential to note that social media is not entirely negative. It has also given people a voice and a platform to express themselves, which is vital for any democracy.

This type of activism can pose a challenge for governments, as they need to find new ways to engage with these movements and address the issues that they raise.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that social media poses several challenges for the government, including misinformation and propaganda, content regulation, and new forms of activism. However, it should also be noted that social media has also provided opportunities to enhance communication and promote transparency.

            "human_gen_truncate": "kept in mind as well\u2014in the area of healthcare, new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital have been built in older HDB estates. In terms of living spaces, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has installed, as part of the Silver Zone programme, new road safety features at selected locations in five residential areas with a higher proportion of elderly residents \u2014Bedok, Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Marine Parade and Bishan\u2014such as special road signs and markings to demarcate the Silver Zones and traffic calming measures to slow down motorized traffic and enable motorists to keep a better look-out for pedestrians. Positive response for this scheme has prompted the government to expand the project by aiming to revitalize another 15 more estates to become silver zones by 2017 and 35 silver zones by 2020. The government is not the only stakeholder in embracing the old, with Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWOs) in Singapore also playing an integral role in the healthcare of the elderly as seen in the establishment of four community hospitals, two chronic sick hospital, 47 nursing homes and hospices, such as the Assisi Hospice, St Joseph'sHome and Agape Methodist Hospice, 17 day rehabilitation centres and home care services for the elderly. These measures have certainly been successful, as a recent report released by the Institute of Policy Studies indicated that 80% of respondents felt confident about their needs being taken care of and that in general most elderly Singaporeans have little to worry about. It thus seems safe to conclude that Singapore has done much to embrace the old, not only in the workplace, but also in terms of healthcare and living conditions.\nYet, despite numerous efforts to accord the aged with equal rights and ensure that they are well-blended into the society, there are instances where the elderly feel outcast and left behind as the rest continue to move forward. Even the government may slip up at times\u2014in 2017, MediShield Life paid just $4.50 of a senior's$4,477 post-subsidy bail, undermining the very purpose of MediShield Life to keep healthcare affordable to the elderly. The Ministry of Health (MOH) took action not after repeated complaints, but only after The Straits Times published an article on the incident. Among Singapore citizens, many youths and middle-aged workers may, understandably, frown upon the idea of spending vast amounts of resources on the elderly at their expense. This attitude was showcased in the opposition against the construction of a nursing home in Bishan some years back\u201440 residents submitted a petition calling on the government to build the home elsewhere, citing that they were unwilling to give up the football field to make way for the nursing home and to live in close proximity to the aged who would disturb their and tranquillity with their constant groaning. Nonetheless, such cases are mostly isolated, and MOH has also revised its policies to ensure that hospitals cannot overcharge patients and that the elderly can make sufficient claims. Furthermore, the government has over nearly two decades attempted to bridge the gap between the youth and elderly. The Maintenance of Parents Act was passed in 1997 to protect the rights of the elderly and ensure that they are rightfully taken care of by their children financially, making Singapore the only state in the world to legally oblige grown-up children to care for their parents. In July 2002, the Family Matters! Singapore Taskforce on Grandparenting and Inter-generational Bonding was set up to promote activities that foster interaction and bonding between people of different generations and to learn from each other. Such moves are bound to improve understanding between the young and older people and chisel away stereotypes that the elderly are feeble, inactive or of little use to society. This will in turn result in a mindset change and the elderly would be valued by the society.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made great leaps in embracing the old, which are increasingly forming a larger proportion of the population. From keeping them in the workforce to healthcare coverage to suitable living spaces, Singapore does seem to have welcomed the old with open arms as an asset to the country and as people who deserve to be well-taken care of, rather than marginalising them.

While we have policies that aim to improve the well-being of elderly citizens, there is room for improvement. The current cost of living and healthcare system in Singapore leaves many elderly struggling to get by on limited savings, and this may pose a problem as Singapore's population ages.\n\nOne aspect where Singapore has struggled to embrace the old has been in integrating traditional values and practices into modern society. While we have festivals and events that celebrate our heritage, some traditional values may sometimes clash with modern aspirations. A prime example of this is the recent controversy surrounding plans to demolish Golden Mile Complex, an important landmark for the Thai population in Singapore. Many argued that its destruction would symbolize the erasure of traditional cultural spaces. \n\nFurthermore, Singapore's rapid pace of development, urbanisation and globalisation has led to some loss of traditional values and practices. We have become reliant on technology and have lost the art of face-to-face conversations. This reflects a growing trend in young Singaporeans to place more emphasis on western values and modernity than on our cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the degree of success which Singapore has had in embracing the old is subjective and dependent on various factors. While our government has initiated several policies aimed at better care and support for the elderly, challenges remain. Furthermore, while we may celebrate and embrace our cultural heritage and traditions, some may argue that we have not fully integrated these values into modern society.

The government has also introduced initiatives to help the elderly better navigate public spaces, such as the installation of grab bars and anti-slip mats in public toilets. Over the past few years, there has been a push to create more senior-friendly housing, such as the Build-To-Order (BTO) flats which are purpose-built for seniors, with wider corridors and lower counters. In addition, there are many community programs such as SilverConnect and Senior Activity Centers which aim to keep the elderly active and engaged through a range of activities like exercise classes, computer courses, and social events. Such initiatives are essential as they help the elderly to age gracefully and productively, while being integrated into society. \n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has undoubtedly come a long way in embracing the old. The society recognises that the elderly forms an integral part of Singapore and hence, taking good care of them is not only a moral issue but a practical one. Policies and programs have been introduced to ensure that the elderly are not excluded from society, but rather integrated in it and valued for their contributions.

Buildings in Singapore have been retrofitted with amenities such as ramps, wheelchair lifts, handrails, visual-tactile surfaces and braille signs to allow greater ease of accessibility for the elderly. In addition, the Housing Development Board is providing elderly upgrades schemes for seniors to modify their homes to age-friendlier designs, such as wider bathroom doors, and nonslip flooring in the kitchen and bathroom, which will go a long way in enhancing their quality of life and grant them independence.\nTo conclude, Singapore has come a long way in embracing its elderly population, recognizing the needs and value of its senior citizens.

The government is even taking steps to organise more social activities that cater to the elderly, promoting social interactions with other age groups in order to better integrate them in society. Through these measures, Singapore is creating a more inclusive society that values and embraces the elderly. \n\nOverall, Singapore has made vast strides in embracing the elderly, in terms of expanding employment opportunities, developing medical and healthcare facilities and even redesigning the environment and infrastructure for their needs.

It is evident that such policies and programmes have been a resounding success\u2014they have allowed many elderly citizens to be assured that their welfare is taken care of and have given them more peace of mind when managing their daily lives.\nAnother way Singapore has shown inclusivity towards the elderly is by making the urban landscape and infrastructure more elderly-friendly. For instance, the Housing Development Board (HDB) has introduced schemes like the Lift Upgrading Programme and the Neighbourhood Renewal Programme to revamp and age-proof estates, making it easier for senior citizens to navigate around their estates and access public amenities like markets and food centres. Similarly, the Land Transport Authority has progressively implemented initiatives such as the Silver Service taxi fleet and senior-friendly pedestrian crossings, with the aim of making transportation more elder-friendly. Apart from public infrastructure, Singapore also places a strong emphasis on creating opportunities for the elderly to participate in community activities and contribute towards the society. The Community Networks for Seniors and the Get Active Singapore initiatives offer a range of activities such as exercise classes and volunteer work opportunities, through partnerships with community organisations to promote intergenerational bonding and the social connectivity of the elderly citizens. All of these initiatives suggest that Singapore has done well in its efforts to be more accepting of its elderly population.\nIn conclusion, Singapore's success in embracing its ageing population is undeniable. Through a multi-faceted approach of more elderly-friendly infrastructure, incentivising older workers to stay in the workforce, and investing in the healthcare and welfare of the elderly, Singapore has set a positive benchmark for other countries. With the number of elderly citizens expected to rise in the future, it will be imperative for Singapore to continue such policies and programmes, so as to create an inclusive, fair and equitable society where all members, regardless of age, can lead dignified and fulfilling lives.",

Furthermore, there has been a shift in focus from institutionalised care towards home care as it is proven to be more comfortable, familiar and, in the long run, more affordable. Singapore has indeed taken positive steps towards embracing the old by showing care and concern for their health and living conditions.\nFinally, Singapore has also been restructuring society to cater to the elderly, ensuring that they are not only taken care of but incorporated into new or rebuilt spaces within society. The recent government-led HDB upgrading programme, for example, has seen the implementation of elderly-friendly design features such as grab bars, slip-resistant flooring, and ramps that provide unobstructed access to common areas in HDB flats, making it more accessible for the elderly. The government has also been constructing housing areas such as Kampung Admiralty, an innovative integrated development project which includes eldercare and community facilities and amenities such as an above-ground park to cater to the elderly, alongside a wide variety of shops and residential areas for a vibrant community atmosphere. Singapore has also supported the elderly through the Silver Housing Bonus Scheme, which provides additional income for seniors who sell their larger flats to buy smaller ones in preference for a more comfortable and manageable living arrangement. All these endeavours are examples of development and progress which entail aiding the elderly by transitioning society to be as inclusive and accessible to all.\nIn conclusion, Singapore's approach towards embracing the old has been fruitful and dynamic in recent years. The government's proactive stance on the matter has helped the elderly to feel appreciated, valued and cared for, while ensuring that their contributions to society are recognised.

The Housing and Development Board (HDB) introduced a scheme in 1997 called the \"Elderly-friendly Estate\" (EFE) to encourage residents to participate in building a community that supports the elderly, such as by installing ramps or benches. Such environments encourage intergenerational interaction and promote social cohesion where people are encouraged to support one another, which helps to mitigate the loneliness and isolation that the elderly may experience. Moreover, the Silver Zones scheme introduced in 2014 focuses on improving road safety for elderly pedestrians by adding more speed humps, road markings and even traffic signals to provide safe crossing points which helps reduce the number of elderly fatalities. The scheme has been successful, with fewer accidents involving older pedestrians after implementation, which indicates that these alterations can make a difference in creating an elderly-friendly environment.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has indeed been successful in embracing the elderly as a valuable part of society.

They have introduced initiatives to ensure that the living environment is elderly-friendly, taking into account their needs and potential difficulties faced in navigating public spaces such as public transport systems and buildings. Senior-friendly features include the installation of more handrails, lifts and ramps at all HDB estates, and elderly-friendly buses that enable easier boarding and alighting. The government has also recently set aside funds to enhance the homes of senior citizens and to equip them with technology such as personal emergency response systems, which allow them to live more comfortably and safely. Additionally, activities and facilities catering specifically to the elderly are widespread in Singapore, from community centres to senior activity centres, as it is recognised that elderly citizens may benefit from social interaction and participation in meaningful activities, combating loneliness and isolation.\nOverall, it can be seen that Singapore has made great strides in embracing the old. From enhancing their employability skills and welfare policies, to their healthcare needs and living spaces, the government has taken significant steps to provide a myriad of opportunities, services and support to the elderly population.

With more elderly people living alone or with their partners instead of children, there is an increasing demand for elderly-friendly housing. As a result, the Housing and Development Board (HDB) introduced the Ageing-in-Place (AIP) scheme in 2012 which aims to modify existing flats with elderly-friendly infrastructure to enable Singapore\u2019s elderly population to remain in their homes rather than moving to assisted living facilities. This not only serves to address the physical needs of the elderly population but also helps to create a close-knit community where elderly residents have access to social support and interaction. This initiative has received positive feedback and has been expanded to include the Enhanced CPF Housing Grant, a grant for seniors who wish to right-size their properties or move into flats built for the elderly. Initiatives such as Silver Zones, a trial areas where traffic calming measures are put in place to make pedestrian crossing safer for the elderly, is another indication of the country's commitment to creating elderly-friendly environments for participation, safety, and better quality of life. All these infrastructural changes show Singapore's keen efforts to build stronger bridges between different generations and ensure that the elderly feel valued and included in society.\nOverall, it is evident that Singapore has been successful in identifying and addressing the challenges the elderly face, and making significant strides towards creating a society that is more inclusive of its elderly population. By putting in place policies and programmes that enable the elderly to work, afford healthcare, and live within their means, Singapore has proven itself to be a model society that is socially responsible and compassionate towards its elderly citizens.

In addition, the government has also incentivised housing developments to be elderly-friendly, such as the construction of void deck medical clinics and nursing homes located in HDB estates. The Active Ageing Hub, a new initiative introduced by the government in 2021, is envisioned as a one-stop service centre catering to the needs of the elderly, providing social and health-related services for the elderly. These measures by the Singapore government indicate a marked improvement in the quality of life for the elderly, and a heightened importance placed on their physical and mental well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has been successful in embracing the old, by addressing the needs and interests of the ageing population. From enhancing skillsets to providing elder-friendly healthcare and living spaces, the government has employed a range of policies to aid the elderly. Despite these successes, it is important to recognise that there is still work to be done: with the ageing population projected to reach 40% by 2050, Singapore must continue to rise to the challenge and accommodate the needs of this growing demographic. More initiatives need to be implemented to facilitate intergenerational bonding and reduce ageism, and the country must remain vigilant in ensuring that the elderly have an equal place in society, and that they are not left behind in the rapid social and economic developments of Singapore's future."

In such instances, it is difficult to say that Singapore has been fully successful in embracing the old.\n\nAnother factor that determines the success of embracing the old is the level of respect and value society places on traditional values and practices. While we can say that Singapore has made substantial efforts to preserve traditional arts and cultural practices, there are some issues with modernization that may lead to the neglect of traditional values.

With the rapid pace of modernisation and globalisation, the younger generation has grown up in a world that is vastly different from that of their parents or grandparents. This makes it challenging to keep cultural traditions alive, and we must continue to educate and expose the younger generation to the traditional practices and values that define our heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, the success of Singapore's embrace of the old is a mixed bag. While we have made significant strides in supporting and caring for our elderly population and preserving our cultural heritage, there are still areas that we need to improve on.

Young Singaporeans are exposed to globalized and westernised influences which can sway them away from their cultural roots. Furthermore, the emphasis on academic success and material achievements has led some younger Singaporeans to disregard traditional values such as filial piety, respect for elders, and a strong sense of community. \n\nIn conclusion, the success of Singapore's embrace of the old is a complex issue that involves multiple factors such as government policies, social attitudes, and cultural practices.

While we celebrate and preserve heritage through events and festivals, it can be questioned how much traditional practices are truly being kept alive.

            "human_gen_truncate": " themselves what they would or would not like to see in media. That said, however, it appears that even with higher levels of education, citizens are unable to discern between falsehoods and facts presented to them: a study published in \"Science\", which analysed more than 126,000 tweets on Twitter, found that a falsehood reaches a group of 1,500 individual users at a rate that is 6 times quicker than a true story does. While increasing literacy rates may suggest a population that is more inclined to think critically, reality suggests otherwise. A more well-educated populace may not necessarily obviate the need for any form of control over the dissemination of information to the public, meaning that the concept of censorship may not be any less valid than it was previously.\nHowever, we must concede that there are certain instances where it is imperative that censorship be present to serve as a moral guide or compass of sorts. Its relevance and function is demonstrated in its ability to protect children from the ills of mass media. Children who are exposed to mass media for long hours become unknowing victims when they are unwittingly exposed to violent or sexual scenes. As such, children, who tend to be impressionable and na\u00efve, are especially vulnerable to the ills of mass media. Due to the egregious impacts of such undesirable material, the need for censorship is legitimate and relevant. While it may be true that information on the Internet is difficult to control, the fact that a task is a Herculean one does not negate the responsibility of ensuring that it is done, especially when it is a necessary one. Age restrictions on movies, such as PG, M-18, NC-16, R-21, prevent young audiences from being exposed to material that is sexually suggestive or where excessive gore could result in unwise decisions. From this, it can be inferred that the need for censorship is justifiable because of the prevalence of questionable or immoral material that could erode the moral fabric of societies.\nIn addition, censoring sensitive issues such as racial or religious issues could prevent ethnic and religious strife. By eliminating such sources of instability, the government surely has the interest of the larger community in mind as social cohesion is of great importance to any country. For example, in Denmark, cartoons that were thought to have blasphemed the Muslin prophet Muhammed outraged the Muslim community worldwide, leading to the situation being blown out of proportion. In Singapore, a number of individuals have been prosecuted under the Sedition Act for posting insensitive racist remarks online. In 2015, the Sedition Act was invoked against Ello Ed Mundsel Bello, a Filipino nurse who disparaged Singaporeans as \"Stinkaporeans\" and \"losers\", and allegedly said that he would \"celebrate\" when \"more Singaporeans die\". Another classic case would be that of Amy Cheong'sracist rant case in 2012, where she disparaged Malays for what she perceived to be their low-cost and lengthy void-deck weddings, and also mocked their divorce rate. In these cases, censorship protects individuals and groups from vitriolic speech designed to intimidate and degrade on the basis of race, religion or language and exacerbate existing fault lines. Considering the benefits of censorship which are legion, the practice of censorship especially in a diverse, multiracial country like Singapore, is without a doubt vital.\nFurthermore, many individuals and corporations remain insensitive and even abusive of its use of mass and social media and have yet to reach a level of responsibility. This only undermines the reliability of mass media and calls for censorship laws to govern and regulate the media, so that it reports what is accurate and objective. With the rise in profit-making corporates running our media such as \"The Sun\" and \"The Daily Star\", sensationalism increasingly pervades our print media. The incessant exaggeration of reports not only clouds the judgement of the readers but also trivializes many important news. it should be acknowledged that mainstream media does also tend towards sensationalism and \"excessive coverage\" in order to sustain their viewership. For instance, following the release of a report on carcinogenic processed meat by the World Health Organization, mainstream media coverage of the report and its contents were overblown and often distorted the findings of the report. Even the Straits Times is guilty of sensationalizing reports of crime. This is presumably because mainstream media sources, especially those which use online mediums, tend to sensationalize important news to get \"clicks and likes\", which in turn drives up their advertisement revenue. The lack of journalistic integrity points to the need for some type of control over the information which is presented to the public, to prevent the false propagation of information, especially for news media as people ought to feel reassured that they need accurate news.\nOn a final note, despite the slew of problems that censorship brings about and its diminishing necessity in society, the exercise of censorship is essential and well-founded. However, with the increasing dominance of new media, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor everything. Hopefully with education and the cooperation of the public to utilize the internet responsibly, we can ensure that we do not end up like the dystopian society presented in \"Fahrenheit 451\" where the free flow of information wreaks havoc.",

Firstly, censorship can be used to protect vulnerable populations from harmful or distressing content. For example, censoring videos depicting graphic violence or suicide may be necessary to protect the mental health of young people.\n\nMoreover, I believe that when it comes to national security, censorship can be necessary to prevent the spread of sensitive information that could put the country at risk. There are some situations in which government officials may need to keep information secret in order to protect the safety of its citizens.\n\nHowever, censorship must be used sparingly and with caution. It is important that censorship is not used as a tool to suppress free speech or limit the range of opinions that can be expressed. In situations where censorship is used, transparent guidelines and protocols must be established and applied in a fair and unbiased manner.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship is a contentious issue, it can be justifiable in certain circumstances.

This may lead to instances of violence and hate speech, further entrenching the original bigotry that sparked it. As such, censorship can serve as a safeguard against such events taking place. A relevant example would be the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand, where the live-streaming of the shooter's actions was widely circulated online, inciting further violence and hate. In this case, censorship of such material may have prevented further harm to the families and friends of the victims, and the Muslim community overall.\nIn conclusion, while censorship can serve as a protective mechanism, it should only be used as a temporary measure and not as a permanent fixture in society. Proponents of censorship argue that it is necessary to protect certain groups from hate speech and false information, but such measures must be taken in moderation and with a focus on transparency. As the world advances towards a more literate and educated population, censorship in all forms will eventually become obsolete and unnecessary. Until then, censorship must be justified on a case-by-case basis, and used only when absolutely necessary for the safety and security of society.

Citizen journalism, which refers to the distribution of news and information by non-professional journalists utilizing social media, can act as a check on the media and help to break up monopolies on information. Hence, censorship may be perceived as a hindrance to the freedom of speech, and the very notion of censorship itself devalues the role of citizens in open, democratic societies.\nDespite these arguments, I must reiterate that censorship is not entirely ineffective in achieving certain objectives. Firstly, governments may need to impose certain restrictions on the dissemination of certain information that could pose a risk to the safety of the country and its citizens. This could include information that promotes terrorism or incites violence. Secondly, censorship may also be justified when it serves to protect vulnerable groups in society, such as children and the mentally incapacitated, from excessively violent or sexual content.\nIn conclusion, censorship, when used in moderation, may serve certain purposes that are meant to safeguard the interests of the country. It is a complicated issue, and one which requires careful consideration of various factors before any decision can be made. We must not be too hasty into advocating for full freedom of speech, as this too could potentially have detrimental consequences. As such, it is important that we do not simply rely on media outlets that only report on stories that align with our own beliefs, but instead broaden our perspectives, engaging in respectful dialogue to learn and understand opposing viewpoints.

The deluge of information can lead to confusion and misinterpretation if people lack the necessary critical thinking skills. The consequences of misinformation can be severe, with people making decisions based on inaccurate or incomplete information. For instance, misinformation and conspiracy theories have led to vaccine hesitancy, which poses significant threats to public health.\nMoreover, in an age where the media can be used as a tool to influence public opinion and sway election results, censorship may serve as a form of defence against election interference by foreign powers.

In our current society, where technological advancements are rife, and social media platforms have become an influential tool, censorship may serve as a form of defence against spreading false news and the exploitation of these platforms.

            "human_gen_truncate": "field of genetic engineering which seeks to modify the genetic makeup of an organism, it appears that science has allowed man to play God, and play God we have. In February 2016, the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority authorised the editing of genomes in human embryos using CRISPR technology for \"research purposes\". In 2019, barely 3 years later, Professor He Jiankui announced that he had altered the DNA of a pair of twins to prevent them from contracting HIV.This could transform the concepts of designer babies and eugenics into a frightening reality. Aldous Haxley's\"Brave New World\" describes a dystopian world where infants are grown in vats and sorted according to their intelligence levels. Even back in 1937, when the novel was first published, the fear of dehumanization and infringing upon the sanctity of human life was already gaining traction among readers.  Does having power alone make us \"arrogant\"? Not necessarily as it can be argued that it is the inability to set limits on our growing powers that constitutes arrogance. Although there is considerable academic debate about the ethical considerations of genetic engineering and authorities are moving to regulate this growing field, it appears that we have arrived at a stage where the ethical debates arising from CRISPR are severally left behind by technological advancement. According to a 2009 report released by the United Nations, 133 out of 192 nations lacked an adequate regulatory framework for the regulation of genetic modification technologies. In the wise words of Jean Rostand, a French biologist and philosopher: \"Science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being man.\" We now hold the biological building blocks of human life in our hands, which can be parlayed according to one'swhim and fancy \u2013 potentially undermining the sanctity of human life \u2013 and we have made insufficient efforts to understand and control the extent of our influence.\nGiven that modern science has allowed us to play God, it appears that our arrogance extends to asserting superiority over the other species which populate the Earth. Much has been said about how mankind uses animals for scientific experimentation, but modern science has even given mankind an opportunity to clone animals for the purpose of scientific advancement, food, environmental reasons, and even for man'ssentimentality. Pet cloning, which reunites owners with carbon copies of their beloved but deceased pets, is now a burgeoning international industry, which has grown by leaps and bounds since the first dog was cloned at the Seoul National University in 2005. Scientists and pet owners alike pay scant regard to the fact that 90% of fertilised embryos implanted in surrogate mothers either fail to implant, or spontaneously abort, or result in \"serious or fatal issues perinatally\", with disastrous effects on the health of the surrogate mothers. This is a prime example of the moral conceit and flagrant disregard for non-human life that sets in following the advent of technological advancement. Scientists have successfully genetically modified Aqua Atlantic Salmon such that it can grow much faster in order to meet the rising demand. The invention of fish that glow as a result of an insertion of a genetic element that causes the fish to fluoresce, is used to detect pollutants in water. Mankind has reached a stage where we can flagrantly transform entire animal species just for our selfish purposes without qualms as to whether these interventions impact the entire ecosystem in pernicious ways. Therefore, modern science poses the serious threat of mankind constructing an artificial environment, against the workings of nature.\nIn summary, though modern science has taught mankind to accept our limited knowledge about some secrets of the universe, it has enabled us to take pride in the ability to carry out research and experimentation that cross the ethical boundaries and jeopardise human safety. Hence, modern science poses the threat of making mankind supremely arrogant more than teaching us humility, and  the path to disaster may not be too far away if we do not rein in our scientific hubris.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "ealth for granted. This sense of invincibility has led to the neglect of our physical and mental health, which has contributed to the rise in chronic illnesses.\n\nFurthermore, modern science has given us the ability to manipulate genes, which raises ethical questions. While genetic engineering has the potential to cure genetic diseases, it also raises the question of whether it is ethical to create \"designer babies.\" Such an act denies the value of life and undermines the fundamental principles of human dignity and humility.\n\nIn order to mitigate these dangers, we need to adopt a more humble approach to science. We need to acknowledge that there will always be things beyond our understanding, and the universe will always hold mysteries beyond our comprehension. We must recognize that we need to work with nature rather than trying to control or manipulate it. We need to take responsibility for the planet and adopt sustainable and eco-friendly practices.\n\nMoreover, we need to learn to use science responsibly. While advancements in science have the potential to improve our lives, we must also remember that every action has a consequence. We must consider the impact of our actions on future generations, and we must make ethical choices. We need to recognize that every individual's life is valuable and that we are mere mortals in the face of the forces of nature.\n\nIn conclusion, the advancement of modern science has made us arrogant by giving us the illusion of control over nature and our bodies. However, we must remember that there is still much we don't understand, and we must approach science with humility.

The industrial revolution which was the result of scientific advancement, brought about climate change which is threatening our very existence as a species. The reckless use of pesticides and herbicides on crops to increase their yield has led to loss of biodiversity and the extinction of many animal and plant species. The discovery of genetic engineering has allowed us to manipulate the genetic makeup of plants and animals, leading to genetically modified crops and animals that may have unforeseen consequences.\nHence, it is clear that modern science has given us tremendous power over the natural world and our fellow human beings, but this power has not been tempered by humility or moral conscience. It is important for us to understand the limitations of human knowledge and be cognizant of the fact that scientific knowledge is not infallible. The pursuit of scientific discovery should be tempered by a strong moral conscience and an acknowledgment of our own limitations as human beings. In conclusion, modern science has made us supremely arrogant, but it is up to us to recognize this and act with humility and responsibility towards our fellow humans and the natural world.",
                "biological building blocks of life, the seemingly omnipotent power of science continues to wreak havoc on the natural world. From genetic modification to cloning, the idea of \"playing god\" has never been more prominent. The potential benefits are enormous, from feeding a growing population to finding a cure for incurable diseases. However, the consequences can be disastrous if this power is not wielded with care. The cloning of Dolly the sheep in 1996 by Ian Wilmut and his colleagues at the Roslin Institute in Scotland, although lauded as a remarkable scientific feat, raised many ethical concerns. It was seen as an encroachment into the realms of the divine, and gave rise to a whole host of ethical dilemmas. The possibility of creating a race of genetically superior human beings, the loss of genetic diversity, and the potential environmental impact of releasing genetically modified organisms into the wild are just a few of the ethical dilemmas that present themselves when we start to consider the consequences of our actions. Yet, the scientists who engage in these kinds of research often do so without due consideration for the potential ethical implications; they are blinded by the potential rewards and are unsympathetic to the consequences.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that modern science has granted human beings an immeasurable amount of power, and we must be careful not to let this power go to our heads. Instead of teaching humility, it has instead made us supremely arrogant, giving us the power to control and manipulate the natural world and our fellow human beings. We must be careful to use this power judiciously, and take into account the ethical implications of our actions. Only then can we truly benefit from modern science without succumbing to its dangers.",
                "environment, our arrogance is especially apparent. Human activity has resulted in climate change, which threatens the existence of millions of species, including our own. Despite the overwhelming evidence, many individuals continue to deny the impact of human activity on climate change, insisting on the superiority of human reasoning. We continue to exploit natural resources for our own benefit, often ignoring the long-term impact on the environment. Modern science has given us the technology to exploit resources on a scale previously unimaginable, and this has made us supremely arrogant in our role as stewards of the planet. We have failed to acknowledge the interconnectedness of life, and this has resulted in the degradation of ecosystems and the loss of biodiversity. \n\nIn conclusion, while modern science has undoubtedly brought about significant progress in many areas, it has also made us supremely arrogant. The power we have gained through technological advancements has allowed us to dominate and control others, and we have often done so with little regard for humanity. More importantly, our arrogance has blinded us to the interconnectedness of life, and we have failed to take responsibility for the impact of human activity on the environment. We must recognise the limitations of our knowledge and abilities, and exercise greater humility in our approach to science and the world around us.",
                "environment, modern science has also made us arrogant. We have become masters of the natural world and have taken it upon ourselves to decide the fate of all other forms of life on this planet. The consequence of our arrogance towards the environment is global warming, deforestation and the extinction of species. We have transformed the planet on an unprecedented scale and in doing so, created a world where the natural world has to be protected by man-made laws.\nIn conclusion, modern science has taught us a lot about how little we know about the universe. The scientific method is built on the premise that nothing can ever be proven to be right, only proven wrong. However, if we ignore this fundamental premise and seek to exploit the power that comes with modern science, we become arrogantly self-assured. The power that science gives uscan be abused, such as in human experiments and the environment. It is vital that we recognise the limitations of our knowledge and cultivate humility, so that we can continue to use the scientific method responsibly.",
                "environmental implications of modern science, the case for arrogance is even clearer. The increasing globalisation of human activities has led to the rapid depletion of Earth's natural resources, with little concern given to their long-term effects. Humans have altered the planet's natural processes to such an extent that they have caused unprecedented levels of damage, ranging from global warming to ocean acidification. Our arrogance is evidenced by our belief that we have the power to control the natural forces of our planet and that we can fix everything that we have broken. We have failed to recognise the limits of our knowledge and the impact that our actions have on the world around us. Our belief in our own infallibility has made us disregard the warning signs, leading us to the brink of ecological collapse.\nIn conclusion, while modern science has undoubtedly enriched our lives by giving us a greater understanding of the world around us, it is also true that we have allowed the power it gives us to go to our heads. Instead of remaining humble and acknowledging our ignorance, we have become arrogant, believing that we can control absolutely everything around us. This arrogance has led to harm being inflicted on our fellow human beings and our environment. As such, it is imperative that we acknowledge our limitations and act with greater care and responsibility while still pursuing scientific discovery.",
                "biological building blocks of life, the power of modern science is even more frightening. Humans can now genetically manipulate organisms, modify their traits, clone them, and even create completely new organisms in a laboratory. While these developments have brought about remarkable advancements in the field of medicine, agriculture, and other areas, the danger of playing God should not be underestimated. With such great power comes great responsibility, and history shows that our behavior when we wield such power has been nothing short of arrogant. As we delve into the unknown and manipulate life itself, we must exercise caution, humility, and morality in equal measure. \n\nIn conclusion, modern science has given us incredible power and knowledge to reshape the world and our place in it. Yet, it is important to remember that the scientific method is fundamentally about measuring ignorance and not certainty, and that scientific progress is not an assurance of moral or ethical progress. If we do not approach our new-found power with humility and caution, we run the risk of using science to further our arrogance and selfish desires, rather than for the betterment of humankind.",
                "environment, the hubris of modern science is again apparent. In the 20th century, we produced millions of tons of greenhouse gases, depleted natural resources, and destroyed ecosystems without understanding the long-term ecological costs. The results of our inconsiderate actions are now crystal clear, as we are experiencing unprecedented climate change, rising sea levels, and natural disasters. Our arrogance in ignoring the consequences of our actions, assuming that we can always invent innovative ways of fixing the issues caused, has led us to the brink of environmental disaster. We have indulged in the luxury of progress without considering the sacrifices that are necessary to sustain it.\nIn conclusion, modern science, when used with humility, can be a valuable tool for human progress. Unfortunately, the dangers of modern science lie not in the scientific method itself, but in how we, as a society, use and perceive science. We must, therefore, re-examine our understanding of science and technology, thereby correcting the scientific fallacy of infinite growth on a finite planet if mankind is to avoid the dangers of our own arrogance.",
                "environment, mankind has also played fast and loose with the powers granted by modern science. We have altered the climate of the planet, and just like we have seen with the almost genocidal destruction of animal and plant species, we have done this with little regard for the consequences. The unchecked burning of fossil fuels, the unbridled use of chemicals and the wanton destruction of green spaces have all contributed to the current environmental crisis. There has been no acknowledgement that we might be playing with forces that we do not completely understand, and no sense of humility that humankind does not have all the answers or the solutions.\nIn conclusion, modern science has provided humanity with an unprecedented amount of power. But with power comes responsibility and unfortunately, mankind has shown time and again that it is incapable of being a responsible custodian of the natural world. While the objective of science is humility, the reality is that if we are not careful, it can lead to a danger. It is clear that we need more than just scientific knowledge to safeguard the future of our planet. We need humility to acknowledge that we do not hold all the answers, and with that acknowledgement, the wisdom to act appropriately.",
                "environment, the arrogance of modern science has had catastrophic consequences. In the name of progress, we have exploited and plundered the earth's natural resources, resulting in widespread environmental degradation and climate change. In fact, according to a report by the United Nations, climate change is happening at a more rapid pace than previously predicted, and its consequences will be catastrophic. It is ironic that the very scientific advances that have allowed us to manipulate the natural world and make significant strides in technological development have also caused us to be the agents of our own destruction. Our arrogance has made us believe that we are above the laws of nature and that we can do whatever we want to the environment without consequences. The reality, however, is that nature has its limits, and we are quickly approaching them.\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of scientific research has the ability to unlock the mysteries of the natural world and advance our civilization, the dangers of modern science cannot be ignored. The fact that scientific knowledge and technological advancements have made us supremely arrogant, and in many instances, abusive of our fellow beings and the environment, cannot be overstated. To ensure that the power of science is harnessed for good, it is crucial that we remain humble and recognize the limitations of our knowledge. Only then can we prevent ourselves from abusing the power that modern science has granted us and ensure a more sustainable, equitable and just world for all.",
                "environment, man's arrogance has also led to grave consequences. The advancement in industrialisation and energy consumption has resulted in the emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, which has contributed to global warming and the deterioration of the natural environment. Despite ample evidence of the dangers of global warming, and urgent calls from environmentalists and climate scientists to reduce our carbon footprint, governments and corporations continue to prioritize economic growth and profit, putting the future of the planet in peril. The irony is that mankind has the ability to create the technology to counter global warming and other environmental woes, yet our arrogance and shortsightedness has prevented us from taking the necessary action.\nIn conclusion, while modern science has taught us the humility of our ignorance, it has also accorded us immense power, and this power has in turn made us arrogant. Rather than seeing science as a means of control, we should see the scientific method as a way to expand our knowledge and understanding of the natural world, and to respect the limits of our power and knowledge. True progress in science, therefore, should always be coupled with moral accountability, wisdom and humility."

These include political involvement, policymaking, and conducting campaigns to raise public awareness, as well as ecotourism. Morocco, a developing country in North Africa, has demonstrated the political will to mitigate climate change by committing to ambitious targets, like having 42% of installed electricity production capacity come from renewable energy sources by 2020, and 52% by 2030. It has demonstrated that it is on track to meet its 2020 target and is poised to meet its 2030 target. As a result, it has been accorded the \"1.5 Degrees Celsius Paris Agreement-compatible\" rating by Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis produced by three climate organisations tracking climate change since 2009.

Efforts in the public sector also supplement the existing community-based projects that aid in boosting sustainable tourism in Belize. Within the Belize Barrier Reef, for example, the gorgeous atoll of Glover'sReef has been maintained as a \"no-take\" marine reserve, a sanctuary where fishing is prohibited. In a place threatened by illegal fishing and overfishing, this unique stretch of reef helps promote natural biodiversity. This therefore highlights that developing countries can still ensure economic growth without sacrificing the environment. Environmental damage can be mitigated with sufficient political will and public awareness, coupled with companies that are willing to play a part in environmental conservation and hence the efforts made by developing countries should be valued and taken into account when considering the stakeholders.\nWe have seen the various stakeholders act separately to conserve the environment. However, the ideal approach in tackling ecological damage should be through international collaboration, especially between governments from various countries, irrespective of developmental status. As their citizens become increasingly vocal about environmental problems, governments have to improvise, adapt and overcome existing and up and coming challenges. It is heartening to note that there have been increased international collaboration, as evidenced by the proliferation of political platforms and solutions such as the climate conferences, environmental summits, declarations and protocols. These have been established to facilitate discussions to deliberate and harness long-term objectives and to implement effective programmes to protect the environment. While many are sceptical of these meetings as many climate conferences like the Copenhagen Climate Conference and the Cancun Climate Conference have ended on a sour note, recently, the different countries have decided to put aside their differences and attempt to take ownership and responsibility of their actions, with the developed countries understanding the needs of developing countries and helping them. This harmonious collaboration was well-demonstrated during the \"COP21\" \u2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, when delegates from 196 countries agreed to the Paris Agreement. The agreement, which is the world'sfirst comprehensive agreement on climate change, was introduced with the objective of keeping the global average temperature increase to below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, by reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 20%, increasing the market share of renewable energy sources to 20%, and increasing energy efficiency by 20%. It was especially significant that the US publicly recognized its role in creating the problem of environmental devastation and finally embraced its responsibility to settle it by pledging to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025. China also followed suit by instilling a target of 20% non-fossil fuels in its overall energy composition by 2030, with additional targets to reduce carbon and energy intensity. Moreover, the Paris Climate Accord is a comprehensive international agreement where under the deal, countries must publish greenhouse gas reduction targets and revise them every 5 years. This agreement ultimately aims to attain a carbon-neutral world before 2100. This therefore reiterates the motion that international collaborations are also considered to be vital in mitigating the pernicious effects of climate change and environmental exploitation, in addition to the efforts made by developed countries.\nIn summary, while it must be conceded that developed countries have a greater expertise to handle environmental concerns, their efforts alone will definitely fall short in the long run as it must be understood that all of us live in an interconnected world where the flap of a butterfly'swings can engender a storm halfway around the world. Therefore, everyone has a part to play in preventing further environmental degradation from developing countries on a macro-level, to individuals and small NGOs, on a micro-scale, and their responsibilities and actions should not be simply dismissed as inconsequential and insignificant. Therefore, the claim that the fate of the environment lies entirely in the hands of the developed countries is too narrow.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "e. Developing nations also contribute to environmental degradation through deforestation, overfishing and other unsustainable activities. Therefore, for the environment to be saved, it is necessary to collaborate with less developed nations, whom without their help, any effort put forth would be futile.  \n\nFurthermore, imbalances in power and resources make it difficult for developed nations to act in the interest of the environment and less developed countries. Many developed nations have vested interests in exploiting the natural resources of less developed nations, and this often leads them to prioritize their economic interests over environmental sustainability. As such, a more equitable distribution of resources and greater involvement of developing countries must be prioritized, partnering with them and providing expertise and support towards more sustainable activities. \n\nLastly, while developed nations may have the technologies to reduce carbon emissions, their economies operate in capitalist frames and often struggle to implement effective environmental policies that align with sustainable development. This struggle of balancing short-term profits with long-term sustainability has made it challenging for those in charge of decision-making processes to put forth environmentally sound policies. It is important for governments and corporations to recognize that there is no profit in a world that is incapable of sustaining life. Therefore developed nations must prioritize policies that align with environmental sustainability to ensure a prosperous future for upcoming generations.\n\nIn conclusion, while developed nations have a greater responsibility and resources to solve the environmental crisis, other nations' collaborative efforts cannot be overlooked in achieving environmentally sustainable policies and activities. The climate crisis is a global issue that requires elusive and inclusive cooperation for the planet to have a safe, protected, and sustainable future. The only way to keep the environment safe is through the collective effort of both developed and developing nations. Therefore a collective effort that recognizes the importance of environmental sustainability and integrates sustainable practices within all economies is necessary towards a better future for all.",

                "holders cannot be undermined. Developing countries have their own unique set of environmental challenges, and if they are not actively involved in the conservation efforts, the problem would not get solved comprehensively. A specific example of the unique challenges faced by developing countries is the issue of poverty and hunger which forces some economically disadvantaged people to engage in environmentally damaging activities for survival. Large numbers of people who live in rural areas and depend solely on agriculture and fishing find themselves using environmentally hazardous techniques in a bid to increase yields and feed their children. Alternative ways to help these farmers exist, such as providing education, grants and subsidies in developing countries so that they can move towards more environmentally friendly agricultural practices. More developed countries should, therefore, provide these stakeholder groups with aid workshops, and supplies to enable them to maintain environmentally sound methods of living.\nIn conclusion, it is unrealistic to expect developed nations alone to save the environment since the effects of environmental degradation are felt worldwide. For the world to be sustainable, all stakeholders should embrace eco-friendliness, have the same shared responsibility for environmental conservation and promote international cooperation. However, developed nations have a more significant role to play due to their immense financial clout and technical expertise in advancing eco-friendly technologies that can make a significant contribution to the conservation of the environment.",
                "holders should not be overlooked. Developing nations often possess an abundance of natural resources and so their role in preserving these vital resources cannot be overlooked. For example, Indonesia and Brazil are two of the largest contributors towards deforestation worldwide. By implementing sustainable logging practices and reducing deforestation, developing countries can play a fundamental role in reducing the harmful impact on the environment. Furthermore, growing consumer awareness of environmental issues means that individuals can also contribute towards conservation efforts. Initiatives such as recycling, reducing waste, and using public transport or bicycles instead of cars are crucial to reducing carbon emissions and protecting the environment.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that developed countries possess the wealth, technology, and historical responsibility to lead the fight against environmental degradation, all stakeholders, including developing nations and individuals, have a role to play in protecting the environment. The widespread impact of environmental degradation means that all efforts, no matter how small, count towards mitigating the damage caused by our societal and economic growth.",
                "holders cannot be discounted. Developing nations, regardless of their economic status, are also stakeholders in the global environment. In many cases, they too have to bear the consequences of environmental degradation as they are usually the ones who are worst affected by climate change and natural disasters. In recent times, developing countries have taken significant steps to protect the environment. For instance, India and China have emerged as global leaders in investing in renewable energy, with both countries investing heavily in clean energy technology. In fact, China leads the world in the production and export of solar panels. Other developing nations have also been taking steps to promote environmental awareness through measures such as afforestation and urban greening. Costa Rica, for example, has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2021 while Bhutan is the only carbon-negative country in the world. It is clear that developing countries also play a crucial role in environmental conservation, and their efforts should not be overlooked.\nIn conclusion, while developed countries may have a greater historical responsibility and financial means to protect the environment, the fight to save our planet cannot be fought alone by developed countries. It is important for all stakeholders, developed and developing nations alike, to come together and work towards a sustainable future for all. This requires a shift in the way we approach the issue of environmental conservation, moving away from a narrative that solely depends on developed countries, but rather one that recognises that all nations have a role to play in safeguarding our planet.",
                "holders, including developing nations and individuals worldwide, are equally indispensable. In fact, developing nations have a greater opportunity to shape the future of environmentalism because they can adopt green practices from the outset and use the latest techniques and technology. For instance, developing nations have the ability to introduce renewable energy sources on a large scale more easily than developed nations. Countries such as India and China, which are some of the world's largest greenhouse gas emitters have made significant strides towards environmentalism. As the world's largest producer and consumer of wind turbines and solar panels, China has been able to substantially reduce its intensity of carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP, in recognition of the fact that fossil fuels are a finite and environmentally-destructive resource. Even smaller countries such as the Maldives have made great strides towards achieving carbon neutrality by 2020 through the use of renewable energy and carbon farming. It is therefore clear that developing nations have the potential to make major contributions to environmental conservation and the fight against climate change, given that they have greater flexibility and can learn from developed nations' experiences.\nAdditionally, individual efforts are essential to the conservation of the environment. People worldwide can engage in small acts of environmentalism that can have a long-lasting impact. Simple steps such as reducing wastage and adopting environmentally friendly habits like cycling or using public transportation instead of driving cars can be a stepping stone towards a greener future. Education also plays an essential role in teaching individuals about practical ways to conserve the environment. Such activities can lead to a collective and long-lasting movement towards environmentalism.\nIn conclusion, while developed nations have a significant role to play in environmental conservation, it is apparent that concerted efforts by all stakeholders, including developing countries and individuals worldwide, are essential to mitigating the global environmental challenge. Only through collective efforts and the adoption of environmentally-friendly practices in all quarters can we make a substantial and long-lasting impact on the state of our environment and ensure the future of our planet.",
                "holders cannot be entirely dismissed. Developing countries, for instance, can positively contribute to environmental sustainability by implementing eco-friendly policies and programs on a local level. A perfect example of this is Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) policy, which placed great emphasis on environmental conservation and sustainability. Bhutan has made it a mandatory requirement for 60% of the country's land to remain forested at all times, making it the only carbon negative country in the world. As much as Bhutan's effort might not completely eradicate the issue of environmental degradation, it is a step towards a more sustainable and eco-friendly world, and if scaled up to the international level, a significant difference in the globe's ecosystem could be witnessed. Populations worldwide can also contribute to environmental conservation by practicing eco-friendly habits and cutting down on activities that have negative impacts on the environment. These habits can be as simple as conserving water by shutting off the tap and using a bucket or bowl when washing, using energy-efficient appliances, walking or cycling instead of driving, and recycling. Individually, these habits may appear insignificant, but in the larger scheme of things, collective actions can reduce the negative impacts of environmental degradation.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that developed nations do have a significant role to play in promoting environmental conservation, it is not enough to rely solely on them to save our environment. All stakeholders, including developing countries and individual citizens, must play their part in achieving a more eco-friendly world. It is, therefore, the collective efforts of all stakeholders that will bring about change and a more sustainable future.",
                "holders, including developing countries, must not be overlooked. Developing countries too have a responsibility to mitigate environmental issues as they are contributing to them, although to a lesser extent. It is therefore important for them to collaborate with developed countries and other relevant stakeholders to find workable solutions. Initiatives by developing countries such as the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative in Malawi have been established with the aim of rehabilitating degraded areas and increasing carbon capture through afforestation. This has been done in collaboration with global development partners, such as the United Nations, highlighting the importance of international cooperation in tackling environmental degradation. Similarly, India\u2019s role in the International Solar Alliance and its pledge to generate 40% of its power from renewable energy sources by 2030 shows that a developing country can also take the lead in promoting environmental conservation.\nIn conclusion, while developed countries may have a major role to play in conserving the environment, it would be simplistic to argue that they alone can save it. The contributions of developing countries and other important stakeholders cannot be discounted. Concerted efforts by all stakeholders are necessary to mitigate this multidimensional issue that would affect all of us. It is only through global cooperation and coordination that the environment can be saved, and all countries, no matter their level of economic development, must take their share of responsibility in this global drive towards sustainability.",
                "holders cannot be discounted. Developing nations are equally required to take up their own responsibility towards the environment. While it may be true that some developing nations are not as financially stable as developed ones, there are other ways to contribute effectively. They can take small steps through innovative solutions such as planting more greenery, using alternative sources of energy, increasing public transportation, and spreading awareness about recycling, reducing and reusing. Bangladesh is an excellent example of such an initiative. Nearly two decades ago, Bangladesh was a near-lynch-pin producer of non-biodegradable polythene bags that littered streets, clogged sewers and choked aquatic life. The Bangladesh government, with the cooperation of local non-governmental organizations, began to wage a campaign against these bags. Heavy taxes levied on the polythene bags and the introduction of jute bags as an economical and eco- friendly alternative has seen their use plummet from one billion to below four million bags in two years. Thus, developing countries and other stakeholders need to play a major role in promoting environmental sustainability.\nTo conclude, it is true that developed nations bear a greater responsibility than developing ones in terms of the environment, but they are not the only ones with the potential to make an impact. All stakeholders, including transnational corporations, governments, and individuals, must work together to promote environmental sustainability and mitigate the effects of environmental degradation. While developed countries may have greater resources and technological expertise, innovative solutions can be found in developing nations, and their participation is equally essential to create a sustainable environment.",
                "holders, especially developing nations, cannot be ignored. Developing nations face unique challenges when it comes to environmental conservation. For instance, developing countries may not have access to modern technology, or the financial resources to invest in environmentally-friendly infrastructure. This makes it difficult for them to make significant progress towards environmental protection. Nevertheless, developing nations can still make a significant impact by channelling their resources and efforts towards environmentally sustainable goals. Brazil, for example, has taken the initiative to curb deforestation by implementing the Amazon Fund, which has garnered international support. This has led to the reduction of forest loss in the Amazon Basin region. With a concerted effort, developing nations can take significant steps in conserving the environment, and not be over-reliant on developed nations.\nIn conclusion, while developed nations play a significant role in environmental conservation, other stakeholders need to be involved as well. All countries, whether developed or developing, must work together to mitigate environmental degradation. Multinational corporations must take greater responsibility, and developing nations must be encouraged and supported towards environmentally sustainable policies. Ultimately, every individual must play their part in mitigating environmental degradation, as it is a problem that affects us all.",

Developing countries face numerous challenges in terms of environmental conservation, such as a lack of funding and technological resources for sustainable development. But many developing countries have taken measures to reduce their environmental impact. Brazil has signed the Paris Climate Agreement, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions ahead of schedule. India aims to generate 40% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030. It is vital that developing countries are not excluded from the environmental conservation conversation because environmental problems affect the entire world, not just developed nations. \n\nIn conclusion, the view that developed nations alone are responsible for conserving the environment is flawed. Developing nations and corporations that contribute to the environmental crisis should also be held accountable for their actions. It is essential that all nations and stakeholders work together to mitigate the crisis in terms of their individual capacity. The only way we can hope to save our environment is through combined and cooperative efforts.",

They need to prioritize sustainable development, taking into account the long-term implications of their activities on the environment. While their economic situations may not afford them the luxury of investing in pricey eco-friendly projects, their efforts to reduce their carbon footprint can be seen through more feasible means, such as promoting the use of bicycles or improving public transportation. Small actions, while seemingly insignificant in isolation, can make a substantial difference when done collectively. Developing countries should also recognize that they do not have to bear the entire burden of conservation efforts. Developed countries have a historical responsibility to shoulder some of the responsibility, given that their industrialization process put our environment in its precarious position.\nUltimately, it becomes clear that the environment cannot only be saved by developed nations, but requires a collective effort from all stakeholders. All nations should work towards the restoration of our natural world. Governments from all nations, both developed and developing, must cooperate and work towards environmental improvement together. However, it is also important to recognize the powerful role that corporations as well as the society at large can have in promoting environmental conservation. By holding businesses accountable and taking individual actions to reduce our carbon footprint, we can create a future where humans can coexist harmoniously with the natural world."

A survey conducted by the child labour showed that 75% of the parents in Bangaladesh are unwilling to send their children to school because school expenses are a heavy burden. If the masses are unable to access education due to poverty and destitution, children will continue to be deprived of education, rendering it ineffective in solving problems.\nIn addition, there are certain problems which education would be unable to resolve alone. Although environmentalist movements like the Youth for Climate movement have been gaining traction in recent years, the United Nations noted that in 2018, carbon dioxide emissions were on the rise for the first time in four years. A report released by the United Nations Environment Programme indicates that a tipping point has already been reached in the Artic and Greenland, where permafrost has started melting more than 70 years before it was expected to. Even as Canada announces a \"climate emergency\", its political leaders approved of a new pipeline deal for natural gas. This is because of the sheer complexity of problems like climate change and environmental degradation; most of the time, the education of consumers alone is inadequate and ineffective in halting environmental destruction that has been ongoing for decades. In such cases, strong political will and corporate-sector leadership will be more effective. Siemens, the world'slargest manufacturer, has devoted more than 100 million euros to reducing its carbon emissions by half by 2030. Morocco, for instance, has introduced \u2013 and is set to meet \u2013 ambitious goals, such as targeting to have 42% of installed electricity production capacity from renewable energy by 2020. These examples illustrate the fact that political will and leadership would be more effective in mitigating climate change, especially because domestic energy consumption forms a remarkably negligible percentage of carbon emissions. Some of the problems which we face require a multidimensional and a multi-pronged approach, in which education can only form one pillar.\nFinally, education has its own inherent limitations, which may render it ineffective and even counterproductive in solving social problems. On the surface, it may seem that education is a social leveller that empowers individuals and improves lives. This, however, does not seem to hold true in increasingly stratified developed countries, where the presence of generational wealth is a critical determinant of academic success. In Singapore, which claims to uphold meritocracy, children from more affluent family backgrounds grossly outperform those who come from humbler backgrounds, primarily because affluent parents pass on advantages such as better learning resources and additional help like enrichment classes to their offspring. A research study conducted in 2016 found that nearly 41% of students in schools which offer the prestigious Integrated Programme were from families with a monthly household income of at least $10,000. Conversely, only 7% had similar backgrounds in government schools which did not offer the programme.  Students in the Integrated Programme enjoy opportunities and resources which their peers in government schools do not have access to, such as leadership programmes and education and career guidance mentorship. Given that the education system ultimately feeds into the job market, particularly in Singapore, the differences in access to educational opportunities since young inevitably result in severely hampered social mobility.\nIn summary, education can act as a catalyst to solve problems like poverty and discrimination. However, education is not the panacea to all the problems of the modern world because of the fact that there are people who cannot afford education; because of the multi-dimensional and multi-faceted nature of today'schallenges; and the inherent limitations unique to education. Ultimately, education can make the hopeless image of our future more vibrant and colourful, but that image will still be left incomplete if other aspects of society do not reform and complement education.",

While education is essential in providing individuals with opportunities for upward social mobility, it is not a guarantee that they can escape poverty. Many people live in marginalized areas and face systemic barriers that impede their ability to access education and improve their socio-economic status.\n\nSimilarly, inequality is another issue that cannot be solved through education alone. Inequalities exist in access to education, health services, and economic opportunities. These inequalities are often entrenched in societal structures, making them resistant to change. It is necessary to address the root causes of inequality, such as structural discrimination and societal biases, to address this problem fully.\n\nEducation is also unlikely to solve environmental problems such as climate change, deforestation, and pollution. These issues are global and require a collective effort from governments, corporations, and individuals to solve them. Education can, however, play a crucial role in increasing awareness of environmental issues and promoting sustainable practices.\n\nFurther, education cannot solve all problems such as conflict and war. In many cases, conflicts arise from deeply rooted historical, cultural, and political differences that cannot be addressed through education alone. It requires political will, diplomacy, and dialogue to resolve these conflicts.\n\nIn conclusion, while education is crucial for human development, it is unlikely to solve all the world's problems. Some problems, such as poverty, inequality and discrimination, are deeply entrenched in societal structures and require a multifaceted approach to address them. Education can play a vital role in providing individuals with opportunities, raising awareness, and promoting positive values, but it cannot solve complex global issues alone.

These factors can cause a self-perpetuating cycle of poverty, and are two of the many factors that inhibit education from being the panacea to all problems. Furthermore, education sometimes reinforces the very inequalities it seeks to eliminate. An education can stimulate critical thinking and independence, but it also fosters hierarchies of status based on credentials or degrees earned. This drives a sense of competition and pressure to achieve high academic performance in order to thrive in a competitive job market, rather than to develop essential life skills and help others in the process. In short, education can be a double-edged sword for solving problems like inequality.\nIn conclusion, while education is a crucial tool in addressing social problems, and while it has a proven track in raising income and literacy levels when combined with public health and nutritional programs, it can only solve so much of the problem. Its effectiveness is often contingent on circumstances such as access, affordability, and perceptions.

People who hold such attitudes will continue to resist the educational efforts from outsiders, further compounding the problems faced by these communities. Furthermore, the quality of education matters greatly in determining the effectiveness of education in solving problems. For example, an educational system that is biased towards males would mean that the marginalization of females continues despite the provision of education. Also, educational systems that do not respond to the needs of the local population may lead to a scenario in which the educated cannot relate and engage their communities, hindering the impact of education on those societies. Thus, while education is a significant factor in the solving of problems, it is by no means a panacea. \n\nIn conclusion, education remains a crucial aspect towards solving many of the world's varying issues, but care must be taken to understand its limitations and inherent issues. Education must be delivered and implemented effectively and equitably, ensuring that barriers to education are minimized, and that the education given is qualitatively superior. The role of education in solving problems should not be overemphasized, as education alone cannot solve all problems, particularly those that require broader policy or economic action.

Further, not all civilizational problems can be solved easily with education. The root of many social issues lies in complex economic, political and cultural systems, and addressing these issues require an interplay of different policies and approaches, of which education is only one aspect. For example, while education can be an effective tool against poverty, it cannot fight the underlying roots of poverty, such as corruption. Furthermore, even if education can solve a problem, it may take decades before it can bear results. This means that society may not see the fruits of the education until long after scarce resources have been invested in it.\nIn conclusion, the benefits of education cannot be understated. It has proven effective in solving problems like discrimination and poverty and has the potential to empower and enlighten individuals. Additionally, education has the ability to raise the standard of living in society. However, education is not a panacea and should not be treated as such. There are a multitude of factors that limit its effectiveness, ranging from tangible obstacles like finances and intangible attitudinal factors, to abstract issues such as the need to address complex economic, political, and cultural systems.

For instance, research has revealed that educated individuals are as susceptible to cognitive biases as people who are uneducated, and that their level of education does not shield them from falling prey to the same biases. Therefore, while education can have a positive impact on society, educators should be cognisant of the reality that education will not necessarily solve every social problem, and that other tools and policies should be implemented alongside it.\nIn conclusion, while education is a key tool in solving many of the world's problems, it should not be viewed as a panacea that solves all issues. While education enlightens individuals, it should be complemented with other tools that will deal with intangible and practical realities.

Education cannot solve all problems if the problem arises from a lack of resources, such as food or shelter, and educational institutions might not be able to provide these basic necessities. Furthermore, education also faces issues of access and quality in certain parts of the world. For instance, In Africa, only 76% of primary-aged children attend school, and the majority of those who do attend do not meet basic proficiency levels. Moreover, not all educational institutions are capable of providing high-quality education - a factor which is critical for success. Thus, it becomes apparent that the problems we face within present society are complex, and cannot be solved by education alone.\nIn conclusion, education is one of the most powerful instruments for change and an important part of the solution to many global problems. Educated individuals are more productive, tolerant, and self-sufficient, allowing for positive social change to arise and flourish. Furthermore, education is vital in closing the inequality gap created by the differences in income and opportunities. Despite this, it is crucial to note that education alone cannot solve every problem faced by society. Certain barriers of access and quality limit education's efficacy, and there are issues that it simply cannot solve.

The distribution of resources including income and access to healthcare, for instance, are tied to the way institutions and organizations work, and are affected by policies which might not be solved just by increasing the level of education in a population. Therefore, education is only an enabling factor which might help individuals gain a better understanding of these issues, but ultimately, the solution might involve systemic change beyond the reach of education itself.\nIn conclusion, education can be a tool for social transformation, and an important step towards the resolution of various social problems. However, education is not, and cannot be seen as a panacea to solve all the problems we encounter today. It has its limitations, which include access issues, and the inability to resolve systemic issues which are entrenched in political and economic systems.

Countries with higher levels of schooling aren\u2019t immune to brutality and political polarisation either, as can be seen in places where youths engage in extremist violence despite having high levels of education. Moreover, even in the realm of poverty alleviation, education often fails to reach some of the most impoverished and is unable to empower those who lack the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, and healthcare. \nIn conclusion, education is undoubtedly one of the tools that help address a broad range of problems. Still, education, however valuable, should not be expected to solve every problem. Policymakers must understand that education, though powerful, is just one of many toolsthat are effective within our world today. Education as a solution must be seen within its limitations, and its role as an instrument which must be supported and balanced by other societal transformations such as economic empowerment, social policies, and strategies that promote peace and justice.

Besides, education can only do so much to change ingrained patterns of behaviour. Education can teach individuals about positive social norms, however, it cannot always change attitudes and practices that individuals have internalised and have been practising for years. For example, despite the existence of intolerance education programmes in schools, some students may continue to hold onto segregationist beliefs, and some teachers might continue to be dismissive of students who challenge these beliefs. Therefore, while education has been tried and tested in addressing many problems, its impact can be limited due to external and behavioural factors. \n\nIn conclusion, education is undoubtedly a powerful tool that can solve many of the world's problems.

            "human_gen_truncate": "s is a clear sign of regression as it infringes on people'srights to protect their personal life, making them vulnerable in the process.\nYet, despite claims that science and its developments should be curtailed as they pose a risk to the human race, proponents of science would agree that restrictions and guidelines have been placed upon these advancements to ensure the safe use and development of scientific technologies. The fact that societies around the world have chosen regulation over blunt instruments like partial or complete bans implicitly suggest that humanity has benefitted from scientific developments. Science has always helped to expand the combined human pool of knowledge, allowing man to gain insights into the secrets of nature, and enabling him to manipulate this for the greater good of mankind. Science has been instrumental in debunking claims: for instance, the belief that interference with a dead body was an offence to the gods held us back from understanding the human anatomy until the 13thcentury. Andreas Vasalies was able to provide detailed drawings of the human anatomy in the 16thcentury, which ultimately proved invaluable to the development of the branch of medicine now known as surgery. The development of the microscope by Anton Van Leeuwenhonk debunked superstitions that diseases rampant in India, China and Europe were caused by \"miasma\", a passing vapor filled with particles from decomposed matter. These examples evinced the claim that scientific advancements have clarified decades of misconceptions which were hindering the progress of human civilisations.\nAt the same time, social and economic ills that had once blighted mankind'spursuit of progress have now been surmounted by technology. While people in developed economies tend to have access to shelter and education, the same cannot be said of their counterparts living in developing countries. The emergence of technology like genetically modified crops and information technology have revolutionized the way people can escape the straitjacket of poverty and improve their lives. The concept of Green Revolution has taken the world by storm as it was able to increase and enhance the quality of food, establishing food security in many impoverished societies. These series of research, development and technology transfer initiatives were regarded as a panacea to the Malthusian conundrum that the world was facing where the world population was projected to outgrow the food supply, possibly leading to mass starvation. The Green Revolution, which involved high yielding varieties (HYVs) and genetically modified crops, resulted in an exponential increase in global cereal production by 280% and in global consumption per capita by 25% between 1961 and 2004. Besides addressing hunger, the Green Revolution addressed other aspects of food security, such as nutritional inadequacy, with genetically modified crops. Golden Rice, touted to be a genetic marvel, was efficient in meeting the dietary requirements of those afflicted with Vitamin A deficiency. In societies where widespread famine has struck and there seemed to be no hope for improvement, the Green Revolution was an enormous breakthrough for poverty reduction efforts and indeed shines as a success story. Amidst mounting worldwide social and economic tensions, the history of scientific advancement only serves to reaffirm the idea that science is the panacea to a wide host of social problems.\nIn addition to fulfilling mankind'sbasic and physical needs, technologies have revitalized the medical arena and have improved the quality of life. In recent times, many tools and procedures have been invented with the objective of prolonging human life. Devices such as the artificial pacemaker have been invented to prolong the life of individuals suffering from once debilitating health conditions like Bradycardia. More recently, the National Heart Centre Singapore has proposed that scans of patients\" hearts could be turned into 3D models. This has long-standing benefits as it helps cardiac surgeons make better surgery plans, especially for non-invasive procedures, and can also be used as a training tool for young doctors. Most importantly, the arrival of such technology would make animal testing obsolete; finally, human health need not be predicated on the suffering of animals, which is a step forward for mankind.People may also pin their hopes on pharmacogenomic research and the concept of personalized medicine, which is administered with the understanding that individuals may have different responses to drugs due to different genes. Medco Health Solutions, one of America'slargest pharmacy benefit managers until it was acquired by Express Solutions in 2011, was leading the way in making the provision of personal genomics services to the masses a reality. It had already achieved successes with personalized treatment of Warfarin, a widely used blood thinner to prevent clots, and Tamoxifen for breast cancer. Essentially, matching the right drugs to the patients has obvious clinical benefits, but also makes good economic sense. By reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis, long hospitalization periods and the need for follow-up treatment, personalized healthcare can generate significant cost savings. All of these will ultimately allow patients to direct their own care to some extent, empowering them with a greater sense of freedom and self-reliance, truly heralding a breakthrough in medical science. Advances in personalised medicine would also allow for the treatment of rare disorders and allow the industry to track the development of diseases. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the National Healthcare System is collaborating with academia and industry to analyse the genetic material of persons with rare disorders through the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is hoped that such information will shed light on and save lives from disorders which were previously unknown. Contrary to popular belief that scientific discovery would cause humanity to regress, the history of medical science is a testament to the fact that scientific advancements can bolster the development of the human race.\nIn summary, science has apparently revolutionised the way we live today, by mechanisation, automation and by altering the way we think. While there are instances, though few and far between, where scientific technologies seem to threaten our very humanity, it must be recognized that those do not necessarily mean science only pulls society backwards. The numerous checks and balances in place today serve to assure us that we can trust science to influence us positively as it always has, as we continue to revel in its wonders.",

Even more remarkable, AI has aids in the diagnosis of diseases that were previously undetectable by human doctors, making healthcare more precise and accessible. It has also improved education by making personalized learning, simulations, and collaborations easier.\n\nMoreover, science has played a considerable role in enhancing the quality of life for people worldwide. Advancements in medicine have led to the creation of life-saving vaccines, treatments and surgical procedures that enable people to live longer, healthier lives. Agricultural advances have helped alleviate world hunger by improving crop yields and created genetically engineered foods that are more resistant to pests, severe weather, and disease-causing organisms. Energy production has also improved with the creation of renewable energy that reduces the carbon footprint on earth.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement that as science advances, the human race regresses is an oversimplification of the situation. Although it is true that technology is rapidly improving and changing the way we live, there is no direct correlation between scientific advancements and human regression. Instead, the progress made by science is beneficial to all aspects of our lives.

Social media allows people to make new friends from different nationalities, as well as sustain relationships with friends and family who have moved overseas. For example, through sites like Tumblr blogs, friendships can be forged between someone living in Asia and another living in Canada. These allow for a deeper understanding of other cultures, practices and ways of thinking that we may not otherwise be exposed to. With this greater comprehension comes more tolerance, and therefore greater unity on a global level. Additionally, social networking applications such as Skype and Facebook allow video calls to be made, which are helpful in maintaining that human touch. Social media has shrunk the world into one that can be accessed from the small screen of a smartphone, reducing the distance between people.\nNext, social media allows individuals from all walks of life to air their views, and facilitates discourse between individuals with distinct, unique perspectives. Since close to 1.7 billion people of the 7.2 billion people in the world today have active social media accounts, there is a smorgasbord of differing opinions online. Social media platforms empower these individuals to broadcast their views, and thus provides one with a unique insight into the views of others. Take for example, Singapore'spolitical scene. Cognizant of the increasing online presence of Singaporeans, the government created a website called eGov2015 in a bid to ensure that feedback from Singaporeans from all walks of life can be heard, and to facilitate greater co-creation and collaboration between the government and the people. Social media therefore makes it easier for individuals and organizations alike to hear different views and thus act accordingly.\nFinally, social media also helps to unite the global community by shedding light on situations all around the world. With the ease of dissemination of information, netizens all around the world are not just able to glean insights into the struggles of others but are empowered to take action. For example, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, started in the summer of 2014, raised $11.5 million for its cause. Over 17 million people uploaded their challenge videos to Facebook, and thus cause was also championed by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. The challenge was started in a bid to raise awareness for the disease known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the use of social media spreading this challenge resulted in its resounding success. A more recent example would be the Trashtag Challenge, where social media users pick up litter, clean their environment and later post a photo of their accomplishments on social media. It has allowed users a better insight of the sheer scale of the plastics pollution problem. It is a good example of how social media can go further than raising awareness to mobilizing individuals to act, producing tangible results. In this way, social media allows for the creation of unity among people, for it raises awareness about issues that society is confronted with and mobilizes people to act in the interest of their communities.\nIn essence, while social media may cause rifts to occur and widen within society, its tendency to unite and bring people together is even greater. The availability of information online allows for the forging of a more understanding and hence, more united world and is something that would have been unattainable in a world fragmented into isolated groups.",

This often is a direct translation of the amount of effort a child puts into his studies, and so, even a child from a disadvantaged background can get into university with government or corporate scholarships. This therefore aids in creating income mobility within the population, preventing the creation of a single educated group, and hence, social segregation and exclusivity.\nHowever, while education may be a means with which one can get out of the poverty cycle, it can also work in the opposite direction \u2013 by widening the income gap between the rich and the poor in Singapore. Richer families are easily able to afford tuition, which sets those children from those families up on a more advantageous position. The help rendered to them by their tutors make it easier for them to excel in their studies as compared to the children from poorer families that cannot afford tuition, hence widening the education disparity between the rich and the poor in Singapore. Increasingly, Singaporeans have lost faith in the education system as a leveller, as a representation of social mobility, with many criticising the fact that students in elite schools tend to hail from affluent family backgrounds, and the increased importance of social capital in Singapore.  Given the fact that the education system has traditionally fed into the labour market, there are concerns that the education system only serves to perpetuate the cycle of inequality.\nLastly, it is possible to have a fair and inclusive society in Singapore through the appeal to the individual. From the age of seven, Singaporean students are made to recite the Pledge in school on a daily basis, subconsciously reminding themselves that differences in race, language, and religion does not make one more, or indeed less, of a Singaporean than anyone else. Singaporeans are taught from when they were young that everyone is equal, and this is hopefully reflected in their dealings with others in the later part of their lives. The creation of a society that welcomes all, despite their differences, can only be done through cooperation of individuals.\nThat said, however, it is ultimately up to individuals to practise being inclusive and non-discriminatory. While Singapore claims to have achieved a \"harmonious and inclusive\" society, in reality, racial and religious tensions simmer beneath the surface; according to a YouGov survey, 23% of Singaporeans have experienced discrimination while renting properties. Minorities seem to be disproportionately affected, with 49% of Indians surveyed and 34% of Malays reporting such experiences. More than 80% of minorities also report the occurrence of \"microaggressions\" in their daily lives, suggesting that even a society like Singapore which tries its best to be inclusive has a long way to go. Notwithstanding this, as long as individuals actively strive to correct their biases, the culture of fairness and inclusivity will hopefully grow stronger.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed possible to have a highly fair and inclusive society in Singapore, through the implementation of government policies, education, and outreach on an individual level, especially since the framework and guiding policies that have been set down by the leaders of Singapore highlights the importance of those two qualities.",

Singapore's education system is one of the best in the world and is designed to provide equal opportunities for all students, regardless of their socioeconomic backgrounds. This has helped to level the playing field and ensure that everyone has an equal chance of success. \n\nAnother way in which Singapore is building a fair and inclusive society is by investing in social safety nets. For example, the government has implemented social welfare programs that provide financial assistance to those in need, such as the ComCare scheme. This helps to ensure that people are not excluded from society due to poverty and enables them to live with dignity. \n\nThe government has also taken steps to promote social cohesion and integration across different ethnic and racial groups. For example, the National Integration Council has been established to promote racial and religious harmony in society. Singapore's multi-ethnic representation in parliament also helps to ensure that the different voices of society are heard and that policies are designed to benefit everyone. \n\nIn conclusion, building a fair and inclusive society is not an easy task. Singapore faces significant challenges that must be overcome if the country is to achieve this goal. Nevertheless, many steps have already been taken to promote social justice, including investing in education, establishing social safety nets, and promoting social cohesion.

For instance, despite anti-discrimination policies and public education campaigns, implicit biases and stereotypes still exist and perpetuate certain forms of marginalization. Even within communities, there may be inequalities or exclusionary practices, which can hinder the progress towards a truly inclusive society. It is therefore important that individuals are aware of and take responsibility for their own thoughts and actions, in ensuring that their behavior towards others is respectful and inclusive.\nTo conclude, a fair and inclusive society in Singapore is not an unattainable ideal. Government policies and an accessible education system have made it easier for individuals to grow, develop and transcend the barriers of social distancing.

Despite efforts made, there may still be some forms of discrimination or individual prejudices that remain, for it is difficult to completely control individual mindsets. Moreover, due to the natural differences in people's abilities and circumstances, there may be some form of social stratification or hierarchy that will emerge.

Despite government efforts to provide greater social mobility and accessibility to education, unequal distribution of resources continues to perpetuate the cycle of poverty and marginalization in disadvantaged communities. Furthermore, stigmatization of certain groups, such as individuals with mental health conditions or members of the LGBTQ+ community, still exists and prevents them from being fully included in mainstream society. These challenges require a multi-pronged approach, involving not only government policy changes, but also shifts in societal attitudes and perceptions.\nIn conclusion, while perfect fairness and inclusivity may be unattainable, it is still possible to strive towards a society that is more equal, accepting and inclusive. The Singaporean government has made efforts to create such a society through policies, education and other measures, but more work needs to be done.

A crucial issue to be tackled is the social divide between the rich and the poor. Singapore is one of the most expensive cities in the world, and this creates a divide between the haves and have-nots. The government has put in place measures to address this issue, such as the progressive tax system and the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme.

As such, Singapore has a strong educational system that contributes towards a fair and inclusive society.\n\nHowever, it is impossible to have a completely fair and inclusive society in Singapore, due to the inherent diversity that exists in our society. Individuals have their own prejudices, biases and assumptions, which unavoidably affect their dealings with others.

Another example is that of The Hidden Good, a movement started by two youths several years back which has also drawn much attention for its attempts to enact change. Through its series of social experiments and online podcasts, the Hidden Good aims to highlight the inherent and latent kindness in each and every Singaporean and make Singapore a more compassionate society. Through these various efforts, many individuals have in their own ways started a spark to fuel. While individual efforts may seem insignificant in a seemingly idealistic cause, it is all these ground-up efforts that have successfully reached out to the disenfranchised and underprivileged who may have been left behind.\nHowever, skeptics may argue that it is highly improbable for an individual alone to make a significant impact in our society, given how risk-averse and conservative we are. They purport that individuals cannot make a significant positive impact on society as the status quo is simply stacked too highly against them and that the authorities hold too much sway over the civil sphere. Some may point to the \"Save My CPF\" campaign, for which blogger Roy Ngerng was sued for defamation for voicing his opposition an unhappiness about the national savings scheme, citing how the bureaucracy and political system are still resistant to change and alternative voices system are still disregarded. In a climate where the government remains conservative and powerful, and the system is entrenched in tradition, the individual seems powerless to be able to do much to change society. Yet, as Singapore moves into a more mature and developed society, this belief is increasingly outdated. While it is true that the government is still conservative and maintains strict control over many issues, there are now many more opportunities for an individual to bring about change, through discourse and activism. As Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said in recent times, the government will move towards a more collaborative, co-creative leadership model under the fourth generation of leadership. Even if we have some way to go before we can become a truly open country that is receptive to change, the truth is that individuals today can already make a change in society in small but effective ways.\nAn individual alone has the power to bring about positive change in society by setting in motion a domino effect that will eventually have far-reaching impact. Through political and social activism, we see how many Singaporeans have come forward to do their part for society by triggering greater awareness and discussion or simply by touching the lives of those they help. As Singapore moves into the future, it is important for Singaporeans to be more participative and engaged in bringing about change in society. Even if an individual effort seems insignificant in the larger scheme of things, it is many of those tiny but important efforts that will move Singapore society into a more developed, civilised, mature and kind one.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " a more massive scale. Social media platforms provide individuals with a voice, allowing them to connect with like-minded people or raising awareness for a cause. Social media platforms have led to the implementation of petitions, fundraisers, and other donation drives, which have successfully raised awareness and funds for people in need.\n\nWhile it is evident that individuals can bring about change, all these examples required persistent effort, dedication, and the determination to bring about change. Change requires a long-term commitment and an unwavering belief in one's beliefs and values.\n\nHowever, some may argue that it's impossible for an individual to bring change in society without the help of others. It's true that change can only be brought about when people come together. However, that does not dismiss the fact that it takes one person to influence and persuade others to create a movement. For instance, in Malaysia, Bersih 2.0 began as a group of individuals protesting for clean and fair elections. The movement drew attention from Malaysians that joined in the effort, and the movement eventually resulted in the Malaysian government's election reform process. The point being, Bersih 2.0 began solely with a group of individuals, and through their persistence, they created a movement that brought about positive change in society.\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that while change is brought about by a group of individuals working together, it takes one person to take the first step and start the journey. It takes one person to make a difference, influence others, and inspire change. It takes courage, persistence, vision, and unwavering determination to bring about change.\n\nIn conclusion, one person can make a positive difference in society and can inspire others to create a movement for the common good. It requires a strong belief in one's values and an unwavering commitment to bringing about change, and by doing so, one person can change the course of history. Hence, collective effort is essential in driving positive change, but the journey always begins with a single individual.",

                "orker went to the media to share her story, and many individuals rallied together to share the story and voice their disapproval of the unethical business practices of Mobile Air. The incident sparked a national conversation about consumer rights and the protection of foreign workers in Singapore, leading to tighter regulations being implemented in the industry. Through initiatives like the Pink Dot movement and the Sim Lim Square incident, we see how individuals have the ability to raise awareness and instigate social change.\nIn conclusion, individuals can make a significant positive difference to society through various avenues, including political discourse and raising awareness of social issues. As Singapore moves towards becoming a more democratic and liberal society, individuals have a greater role in sharing their views and influencing change. Through the power of social media and digital platforms, they can mobilize others to enact change and highlight critical issues in society. As Margaret Mead puts it, it is essential to remember that even one individual can cause a ripple effect and make a positive change in society.",
                "orker's plight was highlighted by online news portal The Straits Times. Soon after, netizens took it upon themselves to track down, confront and name-and-shame the culprit, creating the powerful hashtag #iPhoneSavior. The subsequent social media backlash exacted a heavy toll on the reputation of Mobile Air, with the business's license being revoked and the company being forced to shut down. This incident shows how individuals have the power to bring corrupt businesses to task and prevent future injustices. By leveraging on social media and increased access to information, individuals can mobilise others in similar situations or with similar interests to raise awareness about social issues and their plight, forcing stakeholders to take greater responsibility for change by highlighting their grievances in the public domain. This emphasises the critical role that individuals have in initiating and driving social change in our society.\nIn conclusion, Margaret Mead's adage about the power of a small group rings true. Regardless of whether they act as part of a mass movement or as lone advocates, individuals have the power to create positive change in society. By taking advantage of new methods of communication, such as social media, they are now increasingly able to make a difference. Individuals are able to create meaningful conversations, raise public awareness about topics of importance to them, and galvanise others to work towards a common goal. This demonstrates that with the right intent and attitude, individuals can make a significant change, inspiring and influencing others to ultimately improve Singapore for the better.",
                "orker's story went viral through social media, and many netizens called for public boycotts of the store. In response to public pressure, the authorities stepped in to launch investigations into Mobile Air, and the store had its license revoked. This incident reveals how individuals, through the power of social media and word-of-mouth, can create a \"groundswell\" of public opinion that can force the authorities to take action and redress society's injustices.\nIn conclusion, individuals can make a positive change in society through various means like political discourse, creating awareness and highlighting social issues, or through inspiring others to take action. As Singapore continues to progress and develop as a society and nation, it becomes increasingly essential for individuals to step up and play their part in creating positive change. It takes only one person to start a movement, and with the help of technology and the power of social media, individuals now have more opportunities than ever to make a positive impact on society.",
                "orker was filmed crying after being forced to pay exorbitant sums to the business owner. This sparked outrage online and on social media, with netizens calling for a boycott of Mobile Air. The store eventually closed down, and the owner was brought to court and charged. By raising awareness of the issue, individuals succeeded in bringing justice to the victim and sending a strong message that such unethical practices will not be tolerated in Singapore. These movements serve to show the power of individuals to start and shape conversations on social issues and bring about positive change by creating public pressure and drawing attention to important societal challenges.\nIn conclusion, an individual can make a significant and positive change in society, albeit often starting out as a small step. The power of technology and social media has given Singaporeans more avenues than ever before to mobilize and contribute to societal change. By participating in political discourse, initiating conversations on social issues and campaigning for causes, individuals can exercise their power to influence, shape and make Singapore a better place for all and shape our collective future.",
                "orker's story was circulated online, and it drew significant public attention and strong reactions. The press picked up on the story, and it quickly became a national scandal that led to the store's closure and legal action against the shop owners. The incident highlighted the importance of consumer protection and ethics in businesses, and the individual who first shared the story catalysed a broader discussion on how we can create a more transparent and fair business environment for all Singaporeans. Through these examples, we see that individuals have the power to raise public awareness on critical social issues, and to urge the authorities and fellow citizens to take action.\nWhile individuals can make positive changes in society through political discourse and social awareness, there are also other ways. For instance, individuals can contribute to the community by volunteering or participating in charity work. There are numerous opportunities for Singaporeans to engage in community service and support various causes, such as through volunteering at charities like Food Bank Singapore or the Children's Society. Volunteering encourages empathy, promotes social cohesion and reduces inequality, all of which contribute to a healthier and happier society. Furthermore, volunteering allows individuals to give back to their community and to make a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of others. Singaporeans have shown that they can come together as a collective force to initiate change. The community-driven \"Gotong Royong\" spirit displayed during the COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies how Singaporeans' innate resilience, resourcefulness, and unity can support the nation through times of crisis. It was heartening to observe how many individuals stepped up as volunteers during the pandemic to distribute masks, to provide food and supplies to vulnerable groups or to pack and deliver care packages to migrant workers. These acts of kindness and generosity allowed Singaporeans to connect with one another and to alleviate the difficulties imposed by the pandemic. The individual's ability to serve and support his or her community fosters a better society for all, and Singapore's forward march towards a better future depends on this collective spirit towards achieving shared goals.\nIn conclusion, one individual has the power to bring about positive change in society, no matter how small or large. From engaging in political discourse and social awareness to donating time, money, and resources to those in need, individuals can have a tangible and significant impact on society. In this interconnected world, we should strive to make our actions count and to influence others to become agents of change. Individual actions, no matter how small, can ignite a fire in others and bring about the transformation that we need as a society.",
                "orker's plight was brought to light by netizens on social media, who subsequently banded together to raise funds for the victim. The online outrage and crowdfunding initiative eventually convinced the authorities to intervene and take action against the errant store. This incident highlights how individual Singaporeans have the power to initiate changes in society by bringing attention to social issues that need addressing.\nFinally, individuals can make a positive change in society by being role models and inspiring change in others. The actions of role models can influence their peers, colleagues, and the community at large. For example, Singaporean Olympic swimmer Joseph Schooling's gold medal win in Rio in 2016 inspired the nation with his sheer determination and grit. His victory in a high-profile competition brought Singaporeans together, and showed how individuals, with support and drive, can do great things for themselves, their families, and the wider society. In 2017, the then Non-Constituency Member of Parliament, Mr. Leon Perera, illustrated how one individual can inspire positive change by using his platform in Parliament to promote schemes that balance parenting with career progression. His work highlighted areas to be improved in Singapore's support for working parents and promoted much-needed conversations and adjustments. In doing so, he acted as a role model, showing how individuals can use their platform to make real change.\nIn conclusion, individuals can make a positive change in society through political discourse, raising awareness of social issues, and being role models. While much depends on the successful mobilization of people across society to make positive change, we must appreciate that the power of the individual cannot be underestimated, and the combined effect of efforts can ultimately result in lasting, meaningful change.",

In both cases, these individuals started the conversation on an issue that was not given much attention before, but today, both topics are part of our national narrative. In highlighting these issues, individuals can proactively engage the government and society to effect change.\nIn conclusion, an individual can, indeed, make a positive change in society. The examples above show that through political discourse and highlighting issues of social concern, individuals can play an active role in shaping, if not the entire society, at least our national conversation. A government for the people must necessarily hear the voice of the people, and individuals through their participation in political and social discussions can push for policy changes which accurately reflect the needs of society. It is thus in our collective interest to encourage individuals to play an active role in shaping the society they want to live in.",

Similarly, the social enterprise, \"Hawker Heroes,\" which started off as an individual's quest to preserve hawker culture and rejuvenate the industry, has since become a nationwide movement to support and promote the local hawker trade. Through raising awareness of issues and starting movements, individuals can mobilize others to support important causes, starting from the community before gaining wider recognition.\nIn conclusion, one individual can indeed make a positive change in society by playing an active role in political discourse and discussion, raising awareness of social issues, and starting campaigns that galvanize the masses. The power of individuals to enact positive social change lies in the ability to influence others around them and making their voices heard. As Mead said, small groups of committed individuals can change the world, and with the democratization of information and communication in Singapore today, individuals have more opportunities to participate in the conversation and influence change. It is therefore imperative for individuals to continue to take active roles in shaping the society we want to see.",

As such, these social issues have been given greater attention and momentum, potentially leading to real social benefits for society.\n\nIn conclusion, an individual can make a positive change in society by directly participating in political discourse and discussions, raising awareness of social issues, and by mobilizing others to participate in the conversation. In Singapore, our democratic values have given individuals the opportunity to make a positive change in society, and technological advancements have made it even easier for these individuals to amplify their voices to reach a wider audience. Therefore, while an individual may appear to be powerless in the face of societal challenges and existing power structures, they can still significantly impact society and sway public opinion towards positive change.",

The incident sparked a social media outcry, and netizens rallied together to expose and bring to light the unreasonable business practices of the store. Through their efforts, victims of the store's scams received refunds, and the store eventually closed down. The Sim Lim Square incident demonstrates that individuals have the ability to bring about change by highlighting social issues and rallying support from the public. In this case, the individual took charge of the situation and initiated a movement to ensure justice was served.\n\nIn conclusion, individuals have the power to impact positive change in our society through political discussion, feedback, awareness-raising, and highlighting social issues. As Singapore evolves as a society, it is imperative for citizens to play an active role in shaping the future of our country. The advancements in technology have amplified the voices of individuals, and it is up to us to use this platform to create a better world for ourselves and future generations."

            "prompt": "HOW FAR IS IT FAIR TO CONSIDER THE ELDERLY TO BE A BURDEN ON SOCIETY?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "rited notwithstanding, it is arguably true that the elderly are viewed as increasingly obsolete in the economy of tomorrow.\nYet, while the aforementioned challenges may seem overwhelming, it is essential to recognize that the elderly are not inevitably doomed to be a burden to society. Amidst an increasing elderly population in many countries, it has become ever more urgent and important for countries to tap on the pool of elderly as a demographic group which can bring about greater opportunities and benefits. The elderly need not be a burden to society if sound government policies are devised and implemented to encourage the elderly to become economically productive. The elderly, while less mobile and efficient, still represent a large pool of people who can contribute to the economy. Governments can introduce policies to encourage elderly participation in the workforce by providing monetary incentives, as well as retraining and skills upgrading opportunities. For instance, Singapore has the Workfare Income Supplement scheme, which gives older workers higher take-home pay and increased Central Provident Fund contributions. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices also uses advertisements and schemes to encourage employment of older workers by changing socio-cultural perceptions of the elderly. By encouraging the elderly to become financially independent, less pressure is placed on governments and families to provide support for the elderly. In fact, the elderly can help to supplement the dwindling workforce in many countries by filling in labour gaps such as in the services industry. From the aforementioned, one can evidently see that the elderly can provide many benefits to society if sound governmental policies are put in place to encourage the elderly to become more independent.\nAnother key aspect of governmental policies which can help alleviate the burden that the elderly put on society is in terms of promoting healthy ageing and encouraging healthier lifestyles. With a healthier elderly population, less will be spent on healthcare costs as there will be fewer illnesses and medical issues in society. Campaigns to encourage healthy dietary practices and regular exercise are useful in shaping a healthy population. Technology, the very tool which has led to the decreased relevance of elderly, should in fact be utilized to help the elderly lead healthier lives. For instance, a group of National Technological University students have devised electronic games that require physical participation from the elderly. These games are already being tested at senior activity centres around the island, and suggest that there is huge potential to encourage the elderly to lead healthier lifestyles. Indeed, if the elderly can be healthy and fit, they will be able to contribute to society much more, rather than be a liability to society. As such, it is certainly not inevitable that the elderly are a burden.\nMoreover, the elderly population need not be a burden to society as they can stimulate certain sectors in a country'seconomy. The elderly population brings with it a diverse range of needs that has given rise to the \"silver industry\". This represents a significant growth sector for economies as businesses can tap on growing demand for geriatric services, medicinal and pharmaceutical services as well as infrastructure and facilities that cater to the needs of the elderly. For instance, in the UK, many households have stair lifts which can help transport older family members up and down flights of stairs. In Japan, buses have been equipped with mobile ramps that cater to elderly on wheelchairs. Singapore has also recently been ranked third out of fifteen Asian-Pacific countries in terms of silver industry market potential, which refers to the potential of a market emerging to serve the unique needs of affluent but aging consumers. All these opportunities represent the many benefits that the elderly can bring to the economy by introducing greater demand for geriatric goods and services. This potential growth sector can lead to economic growth for the society. Clearly, the elderly can also bring about benefits and opportunities, and need not be a burden to society.\nIn conclusion, it is not inevitable for the elderly to be a burden to society. While the elderly can be a burden in certain aspects, sound government policies can help to alleviate this burden and tap on this demographic group to contribute to society. Moreover, opportunities are created with an increasing elderly population. Essentially, the issue of an aging population is a complex one which will not be easy to tackle, but it is important to remember that all of us will one day grow old, and will also experience lower mobility, slower reactions and health issues. Growing old is part and parcel of life, and even if the elderly are a burden in certain aspects, this burden must be a burden that we are willing to carry.",

Aging is a natural part of life, and it is essential to provide the elderly with the support they need to age gracefully. This support includes access to healthcare, social services, and other facilities that cater to their needs. Caring for the elderly is not only the responsibility of the family but also the government and society as a whole.\n\nLastly, it is essential to shift our perspective and see the elderly as individuals with rights and needs, rather than as a burden on society. They deserve to be treated with respect and dignity, and their contributions to society should be valued. We must recognize that the elderly are an integral part of our society, and we must work together to create a society that is inclusive of all age groups.\n\nIn conclusion, it is unfair to consider the elderly as a burden on society. They have contributed significantly to the development of our nation, and they continue to be an asset to society. It is important to provide them with the support they need to age gracefully and to recognize their rights and needs.

                "rited or not, it is clear that the elderly are often stereotyped as being unproductive and obsolete in today's highly competitive economy.\nHowever, I believe that the elderly should not be dismissed as an economic burden. Instead, we should look at how we can encourage them to participate actively in the workforce, especially in industries which require high levels of experience and expertise. The elderly possess a wealth of knowledge and skills that can be harnessed to benefit society. For example, in Japan, senior citizens are employed in various industries such as tourism and hospitality, where they can utilize their vast experience and knowledge. In Singapore, the government has also implemented several initiatives to encourage companies to employ older workers. For instance, since 2012, the government has been providing employers with a Special Employment Credit, which is a wage subsidy that incentivizes the hiring of older workers. By tapping into the skills and experience of the elderly, we can help to alleviate the negative perceptions of them as a burden on society.\nAdditionally, we need to address the negative sociocultural stereotypes of the elderly. Many societies view the elderly as useless or even a hindrance to the younger generation. This mindset needs to be changed, and society needs to recognize that the elderly are valuable members of society who have contributed significantly to its development. By respecting and valuing the elderly, we can encourage intergenerational harmony, create meaningful opportunities for the elderly and foster a more inclusive society.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly may require greater public expenditure and community care, it is not fair to dismiss them as a burden on society. Instead, we should be looking at ways to encourage them to continue being productive members of society, by tapping into their skills and experience. By changing our mindset and treating the elderly with respect, we can create a more inclusive and harmonious society that values and celebrates all members, regardless of their age.",
                "rited or not, this societal perception of elderly people as lacking in relevance or dynamism may stigmatize the elderly as burdens to society and reinforce some people's view of them as a liability.\nHowever, it is important to note that the elderly have much to offer to society. Firstly, their accumulated knowledge and experience can be employed in any facet of life, including mentorship, consulting and intergenerational bonding. Singapore\u2019s government has also highlighted that eldercare can be a growth sector for the economy, and valuing such job opportunities would help to recognize the service quality offered by the elderly. Furthermore, some developing countries, such as Japan, have shown that encouraging elderly participation in the workforce can lead to increased social capital and productivity. In Singapore, the government has also urged employers to hire more elderly workers with government schemes such as the Senior Employment Credit, which incentivizes employers to hire and retain older workers. Moreover, elderly persons can provide support and care for their grandchildren, and take up volunteer roles in the community, such as in schools or hospitals. Therefore, instead of viewing the elderly as a burden to society, we should also recognize their contributions.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly population may require greater public expenditure and community care, it is unfair to consider them as a burden on society as they continue to provide numerous benefits and opportunities. While it may be difficult for elderly persons to keep up with the fast pace of the modern world, a shift in societal perceptions and policies can aid in their integration and maximize their capabilities. Ultimately, we should remember that aging is a natural process and that elderly individuals have dedicated their lives to society and deserve to be respected and valued for their contributions.",
                "rited or not, it is clear that the elderly face a more difficult battle in securing or maintaining employment. This exacerbates the perception that the elderly are no longer economically relevant, leading to the conclusion that they may be a burden to society.\nHowever, I argue that the above perceptions are not entirely fair. Firstly,the elderly can contribute to society by imparting their wisdom and experience to their younger counterparts. They can also serve as mentors or advisers in various fields, be it in academia or industry. Secondly, the elderly can take up part-time jobs or engage in voluntary work which can alleviate pressure on their families and have a positive impact on their mental and physical health. A study done by the National Volunteer and Philanthropy Centre in Singapore found that elderly volunteers feel a greater sense of self-worth, leading to reduced depression and a lower chance of developing cognitive disorders such as dementia. Thirdly, the elderly can be involved in niche sectors, which cater to specific needs of the aging population. For example, elderly-friendly jobs such as home-care providers or mobility aid technicians can be created to provide basic care needs for the elderly, thus offering a way for them to be productive and valued members of society.\nIn conclusion, while it may be tempting to view the elderly as a burden, it is important to remember that the elderly are valuable members of society who can contribute meaningfully given the right support and encouragement. As such, it is crucial for both policy makers and individuals to recognise the value of the elderly, and change our mindset to help them contribute to society in meaningful ways.",
                "rited or not, it highlights society's tendency to view the elderly as a burden to the economy.\nHowever, I believe that such views are unfair and limit the potential of the elderly. Firstly, the elderly have vast experience which can be harnessed to mentor younger generations. They could impart invaluable wisdom and life experiences to those who are embarking on their professional journeys. Secondly, with age comes a more calm and stable demeanor, something that is valuable in fields such as psychology and conflict resolution. Furthermore, as the world becomes increasingly connected and diverse, the ability to speak different languages and have a diverse cultural background is becoming more and more sought-after. The elderly arguably have greater exposure to different cultures, and this can be used to bridge cultural divides and foster greater social cohesion. In Japan, for example, the elderly are highly valued for their contributions to public life, providing a rich cultural tapestry and a source of intergenerational camaraderie. Therefore, it is important that we shift our perceptions of the elderly from one of burden to one of dignity and value.\nIn addition, greater emphasis should be placed on encouraging elderly participation in the workforce. Older workers can be given vocational training to adapt to current job requirements, which can lead to greater job satisfaction and security. Research shows that older workers are also more likely to be more committed and engaged in their work. With the right support, the elderly can continue to make valuable contributions to the economy. Embracing the elderly as a valuable asset to society can also foster greater social cohesion and respect between different age groups.\nIn conclusion, while it may be true that the elderly pose certain challenges to society, it is unfair and unproductive to view them solely as a burden. We need to shift our mindsets to recognize the value of the elderly as a rich source of experience, culture and wisdom. It is time for us to move away from negative perceptions of aging, and work towards an inclusive society that respects and values individuals of all ages.",
                "rited or not, it is understandable that society may view the elderly as a burden if they are unable to contribute to the workforce and a rapidly changing society.\nHowever, I believe that we should not simply view the elderly as a liability. Firstly, the elderly can contribute to the workforce if they are encouraged to remain active in the labour market. With extended life expectancy, there is potential for elderly persons to continue working and earning an income. In Japan, elderly employment has increased over the years, and many elderly persons continue to contribute by working in part-time jobs. Similarly, Singapore has also implemented initiatives such as the Silver Support Scheme, which provides annual payouts to low-income elderly citizens. This encourages elderly participation in the workforce, as they are not disadvantaged by the loss of financial support. Secondly, the elderly also bring about benefits and opportunities in certain sectors. Elderly persons are more knowledgeable about traditional cultures and crafts, and can act as mentors for younger generations. In addition, the elderly also have significant purchasing power as customers, and can help boost sales in certain industries such as healthcare and travel. Therefore, we should not simply label the elderly as burdens to society.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly may potentially cause financial and emotional burdens, we should not view them solely as a liability. Instead, we should change our mindsets and focus on encouraging elderly participation in the workforce, as well as recognizing their contributions to various sectors. We should also work towards improving the elderly healthcare support system and creating an enabling environment for the elderly in our communities.",

Firstly, there is a wealth of experience and wisdom that can be garnered from the elderly. In Singapore, around 10% of the elderly continue to work beyond their retirement age of 62, contributing to the economy while also transmitting their skills and experience to younger generations. Secondly, with the advance of technology and education, older workers can acquire new skills, especially in fields such as digital proficiency. In fact, according to Forbes, older employees can be better at communicating, have better customer service and a greater sense of loyalty as compared to younger employees. Therefore, it is important to recognise and tap on the potential contributions of the elderly instead of stereotyping them as liabilities.\nIn conclusion, the elderly do impose a burden on society in terms of public finances and on their families\u2019 welfare. However, that is not to say that the elderly should perpetually be viewed as a burden on society, as they have the potential to continue contributing to society through their wealth of experience and knowledge. Governments should place greater emphasis on encouraging elderly participation in the workforce and provide necessary training to facilitate these efforts, in order to empower the elderly and to benefit society as a whole.",

Furthermore, the elderly can contribute significantly in non-technical sectors such as social work and volunteerism, where their life experiences and maturity are highly valued. Their participation in the workforce can also help to mitigate the issue of an aging population in societies where the workforce is shrinking.\nUltimately, it is unfair to consider the elderly as a burden on society, simply because of the aforementioned challenges. We need to change our Mindsets and resist the urge to view the elderly as a liability. Instead, we should recognize their contributions and consider how they can continue to contribute to society. By embracing such perspectives, we can create a society that values and supports all members regardless of their age.",

Furthermore, the elderly can contribute through various means such as volunteering, which can have a positive impact on the community. As a society, we need to acknowledge the contributions of the elderly and create opportunities for them to continue to participate and engage in society, rather than excluding them and treating them as a burden.\nIn conclusion, while there are valid concerns over the financial burden the elderly may place on society, there are also many benefits and opportunities they can bring. We need to challenge the negative stereotypes and views of the elderly as a burden and instead create an inclusive society that values all members regardless of their age. This requires a significant shift in cultural attitudes towards the elderly, as well as government policies that support elderly participation in the workforce and provision of good healthcare. Ultimately, we must strive to create a society that values and respects all ages, recognizing the importance of each generation's contributions to our society as a whole.",

For instance, they may have valuable skills, experiences, and knowledge which can be harnessed by companies. Moreover, the elderly can also play a crucial role in volunteering and community work, such as assisting in childcare services or imparting knowledge at community centres. Therefore, it is not fair to solely paint the elderly as burdens to society, as they have skills that can be utilized and they can continue to contribute.\nAdditionally, the elderly can also contribute to the economy through an increase in their spending power. With aging comes a shift in consumer behavior where the elderly may have higher demand for certain products such as healthcare services, tourism, and leisure. This translates into job opportunities for the younger generations, hence boosting economic growth. Therefore, it is important to change our mindset towards the elderly and recognize their contributions and potential economic benefits.\nIn conclusion, while the elderly may incur costs to society and be perceived as burdens, we should not overlook their potential contributions and economic benefits. Encouraging elderly participation in the workforce, providing them with relevant skillsets and recognizing their valuable knowledge and experiences, can lead to a more inclusive and dynamic society. With the right policies and sociocultural perspectives, the elderly can continue to play an active role in society for years to come.",

They can be role models to the younger generation, sharing their wisdom on how to live a fulfilling and successful life, they can volunteer with charities and social organizations, and they can even take up part-time jobs or start their own businesses. It is important to change the sociocultural perspective of the elderly, from being seen as burdens to being respected for their contributions and experiences. Moreover, the elderly can bring about significant benefits to certain sectors. They may be preferred customers in certain industries, such as healthcare services and luxury goods, given their higher disposable income and investment experience. Additionally, many elderly persons are interested in travel and tourism, which can spur economic growth in these sectors. \n\nIn conclusion, while it can be argued that the elderly can be a burden on society due to certain financial, emotional and healthcare costs, it is important to challenge the negative perspectives and recognize that they can continue to contribute meaningfully to society. Instead of seeing the elderly as solely requiring financial investments, they should be seen as assets with a wealth of experience and knowledge that can benefit society. By changing our mindsets, we can create more opportunities for the elderly to participate meaningfully in society and benefit from their contributions."

            "human_gen_truncate": "esearch opens up the possibility for such research to be abused and exploited. Research done in stem-cell therapy, cloning, and organ transplants are experimental at best. The results have been inconsistent, and these procedures have not been widely accepted by the medical community. As a result, expecting such genetic engineering processes to improve one'squality of life is quixotic. Nevertheless, as scientists continue to dabble with research of questionable nature, hoping to make a ground-breaking discovery, there is a possibility that ethics and morality will be sacrificed. With the technology to precisely and accurately edit human genetic sequences within reach, designing humans are no longer just a science fiction fantasy. The arrival of CRISPR technology, though still in its nascent stage, has the potential to excise undesirable genes and insert favourable ones into gametes and embryos in a process called germ line engineering, allowing couples to select traits they wish their child to have and potentially turning the concept of designer babies into a frightening reality. Given that the eugenics movement, which essentially proclaimed that all were created equal, but some were more equal than others, had entered the mainstream consciousness as recently as the 19thand 20thcentury, research along these lines might be exploited by the most radical amongst us. Furthermore, the concept is also offensive to many religious groups who believe that it is wrong to \"play God\" by effectively creating and changing life, as well as opposing the law of nature. It can be evinced clearly that the sheer magnitude in terms of expectations placed on biotechnology, could easily raise ethical and moral concerns, especially if it threatens the very essence of human life.\nProponents of medical science would however argue otherwise, stating that faith placed upon medicine and health research is certainly not misplaced, given that it has brought about innumerable benefits to humanity. Its merits span from the early diagnosis and management of life threatening diseases, to the eradication of pandemics that once plagued the world. Admittedly, the positive impact of medical science has been long lasting, which may coax people into accepting it wholeheartedly. Medical science has successfully identified the causes of infectious diseases and destroyed the carriers of such bacteria and viruses. Dedicated research and experimentation have given rise to vaccines and antibiotics to combat such maladies. This was well-demonstrated in the cases of polio and smallpox, where in collaboration with the World Health Organization, medical resources were able to reduce the prevalence of such diseases. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative reduced the number of cases of polio by 99% and more than 2 billion children have been immunized. The negative effects of smallpox were also short-lived as it was officially eradicated in 1980. It has been estimated that at least 20 million people would have died of smallpox had it not been eradicated. People may also pin their hopes on pharmacogenomic research and the concept of personalized medicine, which is administered with the understanding that individuals may have different responses to drugs due to different genes. Medco Health Solutions, one of America'slargest pharmacy benefit managers until it was acquired by Express Solutions in 2011, was leading the way in making the provision of personal genomics services to the masses a reality. It had already achieved successes with personalized treatment of Warfarin, a widely used blood thinner to prevent clots, and Tamoxifen for breast cancer. Essentially, matching the right drugs to the patients not only has obvious clinical benefits, but also makes good economic sense. By reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis, long hospitalization periods and the need for follow up treatment, personalized healthcare can generate significant cost savings. All of these will ultimately allow patients to direct their own care to some extent, empowering them with a greater sense of freedom and self-reliance, truly heralding a breakthrough in medical science. Advances in personalised medicine would also allow for the treatment of rare disorders and allow the industry to track the development of diseases. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the National Healthcare System is collaborating with academia and industry to analyse the genetic material of persons with rare disorders through the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is hoped that such information will shed light on and save lives from disorders which were previously unknown. Indubitably, the public validation of medical science especially in keeping infectious diseases at bay and enhancing their health by providing personalized medicine is indeed justifiable and in no way a gross exaggeration of our gargantuan trust on medical science.\nIn sum, medical science remains essential and indispensable due to the benefits it has on the well-being of Man. As this branch of science continues to expand, evolve and develop, it is inevitable that mankind would place much of their hopes and utmost faith in it to provide them with enhanced longevity. However, past and present experiences have revealed that this may not necessarily be a wise decision, as it poses risks that may be catastrophic if not cured in time. It is imperative that ethical restrictions be present to act as a moral compass and ensure that our desires and trust do not tip the scale, lest we might find ourselves being reduced to soulless beings, stripped of our mental faculties and perhaps, depending on soma, in the near future.",

                "esearch presents risks. The internet, with its free-flowing information, has created the notion that alternatives to medical science exist. The trend towards alternative medicine is gaining momentum, particularly in the developed world where people believe in the power of herbs, supplements, acupuncture and other treatments to heal a wide range of ailments. Disgruntled with mainstream medical science provoking unwelcome side effects, many are opting for alternative approaches that offer more natural, less invasive treatments. However, these alternative treatments are often untested, with questionable effectiveness that could pose a huge risk to the vulnerable and ill patients that place their trust in them. In the United States alone, over three million individuals have found themselves in the emergency department as a result of herbal product consumption. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in 2020 concerning the use of chloroquine meant for the treatment of COVID-19, which has resulted in individuals self-medicating and overdosing on quinine. The situation has become so alarming that the FDA has categorically stated that chloroquine poses serious side effects when consumed in large doses and without a prescription. The growing resistance towards traditional medicine and the increasing inclination towards unproven methods of treatment serves as a warning that medical science should be cautiously approached and not excessively relied upon.\nTherefore, it is evident that while medical science and technology have proven successful in treating diseases and enhancing lives, they are not infallible. There exists a tendency to place too much faith in them, and this exposes patients to various risks. The rising acceptance and willingness to undertake cosmetic surgeries for unnecessary procedures, opting for an unrealistic 'quick fix' over a healthy lifestyle, and embracing alternative medicines that have questionable efficiency are all examples of the public's disproportionate trust in medical science. As we venture deeper into the 21st century, there is a requirement for one to be more vigilant and assess the risks that come along with relying on medical science.",
                "esearches could lead to disastrous outcomes. Medical science relies heavily on trial and error which means not all treatments or procedures that were initially thought to be effective actually worked in the long run. One such example is the discovery of Thalidomide in 1957, which was marketed as a miracle drug that could relieve nausea or discomfort during pregnancy. However, it was later found that Thalidomide could cause endless problems, ranging from birth defects during pregnancy. Thousands of children were born with malformed limbs, and a vast majority of them died at an early age or suffered from severe disabilities. Thalidomide served as a deadly reminder of the potential long-term dangers associated with medical science. Unfortunately, not everyone learns from history, as there are still sporadic cases of black market treatments, substances and therapies that are highly untested and exceed the limits of traditional science, which can be detrimental to the well-being of patients. In other cases, patients seeking unconventional treatments that they believe to be beneficial have resorted to or have been subjected to controversial or even fake medical treatments, which adds to more problems and unnecessary suffering of patients.\nIn conclusion, medical science has contributed significantly to the overall well-being and safety of individuals. However, a fine balance between putting faith in it and understanding its limitations has to be struck. The excessive emphasis on medical science as a means to eradicate all issues associated with the human body may lead to negative consequences. Instead, people should be more willing to be actively engaged in their own health and wellness, taking up a healthy lifestyle, which includes eating well, exercising regularly and minimizing stress. If the public still believes that medical science is the solution for all their problems, they should carefully assess the reliability of treatments or therapies and the credentials and reputation of the providers before undergoing them.",
                "esearch also highlights the dangers of excessive faith in medical science. During the early days of HIV/AIDS, the medical fraternity was at a loss as to how to diagnose and treat the disease. This lack of knowledge prompted the government and public health organizations to inject significant funding into HIV/AIDS research, which led to the discovery of antiretroviral therapy(ART), which has since saved millions of lives. Despite the fact that antiretroviral therapy has provided a significant step in the treatment of HIV/AIDS, scientists may have crossed a line when they decided to experiment with a cure, like they were searching for a holy grail in the form of a cure. Records suggest that in the 1980s and 90s, the US military with the intention of studying HIV developed a cocktail of drugs which was administered to unsuspecting service members without their consent, in a bid to avoid human subject research ethics committees, paving the way for more risky medical experiments. Similarly, the highly controversial HeJiankui scandal in 2018 called into question the ethical considerations behind some of these experiments. Jiankui had used CRISPR, a tool to edit genes, to give gene-edited babies HIV immunity and higher cognitive abilities, taking the medical community by surprise and raising the spectre of unnecessary manipulation of the human genome. Evidently, unbridled faith in cutting-edge research could pose significant risks to patients and humanity at large by ignoring the vital ethical considerations that need to accompany such research.\nGiven these examples, it is plausible to concur that the belief that medical science can solve all of our problems is unwarranted. While it has undoubtedly brought about countless positive changes in the world, to place unbridled trust in one field of science poses the danger of neglecting other aspects of life that contribute to good health, such as a balanced diet, exercise and good mental health. \nIn conclusion, I agree that people have placed too much faith in medical science, leading to negative consequences, such as an unrealistic perception of the curative powers of medicine, a preoccupation with cosmetic surgery and the potential dangers of untested cutting-edge research. It is imperative for people to realise that medical science is but one aspect of a multi-faceted solution to health, and a balanced approach between medical science, lifestyle changes, and ethical considerations should be adopted for lasting and sustainable progress in the medical field and humanity in general.",

Regrettably, some of these treatments are not backed up by scientific evidence and have not been tested rigorously through clinical trials. The trend towards embracing alternative treatments is likewise a testament to the overreliance on medical science; the eagerness to pursue the next best medical breakthrough or shortcut to good health without being aware of the potential risks that such treatments pose. Some of the risks include the severe side effects of treatment and the danger of abandoning mainstream treatments, which could have an adverse impact on one'soverall health. For instance, there has been a surge in individuals indulging in \"Juice cleanse\" in recent years as they believe their bodies need to be detoxed. Whereas there are benefits to having a healthy digestive and excretory system, the reality is that herbs or other concoctions administered in these cleanses can interact with medications, lead to nutrient deficiencies and dehydration, besides not being medically proven to remove toxins from the body. While some people may benefit from alternative therapies, it is critical for the public to remember that not all alternative medicine is equal, and there is a need to consult a doctor before opting for any such treatments.\nIn a nutshell, it can be argued that the public may place too much faith in medical science, to the point of treating it as a panacea for all problems. This misplaced trust can lead to erroneous beliefs and unrealistic expectations, such as thinking that medication can replace a healthy lifestyle or that cosmetic surgeries can eliminate all physical flaws. However, it is important to acknowledge that medical science has been successful in curing diseases and prolonging human life. To strike a balance, the public should be aware of the limitations of medical science and its unpredictable nature, as well as the risks associated with alternative treatments, and approach medical treatments with a critical and informed mind.",
                "esearch also can be seen when individuals ignore solid medical practices and opt for new and untested treatments. This was seen during the Zika epidemic in 2016, when experimental treatments that were not yet validated by the medical community were offered by various institutions, giving rise to moral and ethical concerns. A similar case can be noted with the recent uproar over the anti-vaccination movement that severely hampers medical science's attempts to vaccinate the population. To be sure, some individuals have legitimate concerns about whether vaccines are safe, but the anti-vaccination movement, aided by social media, has stirred up unnecessary panic. Its insidious growth is particularly worrying since it endangers the most vulnerable segment of population like infants and elderly people. Indeed, widespread misinformation about vaccines has led to deadly outbreaks of preventable diseases such as measles and mumps. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has declared vaccine hesitancy one of the top ten threats facing the world in 2019. It is thus imperative that people acknowledge the advances made by medical science and allow it to continue making progress, but also strike a balance between new and traditional methods of treatment to ensure that medical science remains dependable, credible and safe.\nIn conclusion, it is true that medical science has largely delivered on its promise to improve human health beyond what Alexander Fleming would have dreamt of a century ago. However, it is important to note that the proliferation of faith in medical science has resulted in other problems such as excessive consumption of drugs, the obsession with physical appearance and the spread of misinformation about vaccines. It is therefore crucial that the public strikes a balance between the trust they have placed in medical science and the principles of safe, ethical medicine to maintain their well-being.",
                "esearch has also led to the blurring of the lines between science fiction and reality, with potentially harmful effects. The various research projects carried out by corporations like Google, such as their attempt to potentially extend human lifespan to three centuries and over, have the potential of going wrong and causing disastrous consequences for those involved. Similarly, medical researchers have recently been heavily focused on gene editing and creating designer babies, thereby manipulating the very essence that defines humanity, and perhaps inadvertently supporting a eugenic ideology. The high stakes of gene editing caused a furore in the scientific community when Chinese scientist He Jiankui claimed to have created the world's first genetically edited human babies, resulting in widespread criticism and public outrage. It is clear that such research needs to be undertaken with great care, consideration and with the cautionary principles of the autonomy of the individual and the sanctity of human life held in mind.\nIn conclusion, it cannot be denied that medical science has enriched and saved countless lives. However, a society that unconditionally places its trust in that science violates the very essence of our humanity, as the inordinate faith we attach to it could lead to an obsession with untested treatments/procedures, the unnecessary consumption of drugs, and the choice to tamper with the sanctity of human life. As such, it is vital that we view medical science not as an infallible elixir, but as a complex, multifaceted field with its contradictions, fallibilities, and uncertainties.",
                "esearch and treatments might inadvertently harm patients, as well as negatively affect the progress and reputation of the medical field. In 2017, a young American doctor named YoungsooJun, caused an uproar when he created a start-up called \"NanoHybrids\". Jun claimed to invent a revolutionary new technology to diagnose cancer cells using gold nanoparticles, which were small enough to penetrate inside human cells and bind to proteins that are only found on cancerous cells. He promised that the new diagnostic test would revolutionise cancer treatment. Consequently, he received a grant from the National Science Foundation to fund his start-up. His claims were later exposed to be fraudulent, and he was sentenced to 57 months in prison for embezzlement, wire fraud and making false statements. It is believed that innocent cancer patients and their families were caught in the crossfireof his ambition to achieve fame and fortune. Cases of medical negligence and malpractice have also resulted in fatalities, such as the overdose of Joan Rivers during a minor procedure for cosmetic surgery. Such instances illustrate how faith in the medical industry can sometimes be misplaced and stem from undesirable consequences in the form of physical and/or psychological harm to patients.\nIn conclusion, despite the incredible advances in medical science that have delivered on its promises, people could be placing too much faith in medical science. This misplaced confidence is manifested in the form of neglecting one'sphysical health in favour of overconsumption of medication, pursuing risky cosmetic procedures such as cosmetic surgery and believing in untested, fraudulent claims of medical breakthroughs, which could pose a threat to patients' lives. While placing faith in medical science is not necessarily a bad thing, it is essential to balance it with a healthy dose of scepticism, as well as understanding the limitations and risks associated with new medical interventions. Ultimately, personal responsibility and balance are essential in building a sustainable relationship between individuals and the medical industry.",
                "eligiously adopted by some individuals could pose a risk to their well-being, given that scientific evidence supporting these treatments, medications and procedures may be lacking. The proliferation of alternative practitioners such as chiropractors and herbalists have been accepted by the general public, with people readily seeking assistance for maladies not necessarily treated by conventional medicine. In Singapore, traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture are some of the more well-known alternative treatments which people are willing to try out. There is often no scientific evidence to prove that these treatments are effective, nor are there existing regulations which are able to protect the patient's welfare and safety. This poses a danger to the general public as these health practitioners might provide improper diagnoses and treatments which could lead to worsening of symptoms and in certain cases, irreparable damage to one's health. In fact, an Australian study, that analysed 330 chiropractic cases in Victoria, found that approximately 1 in 10 patients experienced adverse events from receiving chiropractic treatment over a 2-week period. Worse still, chiropractic treatment has led to the death of several people, through the delayed or absence of recognised medical advice.\nIn conclusion, while medical science has propelled us into an era where the treatment of various ailments is no longer an unattainable ambition, it is crucial that we do not become complacent and place too much trust in it. The unrealistic expectations and insatiable human desires that fuel the cosmetic industry and the proliferation of alternative medicine at the cost of conventional medicine could potentially be lethal for patients who are willing to try out untested methods. It is healthy to stay sceptical while still acknowledging the indispensable contributions of medical science to human health. Ultimately, striking a balance between faith in medical science and rational scepticism would be key to benefiting from the advances in medical technology.",
                "esearch has also led to several cases of medical malpractice and unethical trials. One of the most notorious cases of the former is the Thalidomide scandal that occurred in the 1950s and 1960s. Thalidomide, a drug that was marketed as a cure for morning sickness in pregnant women, had disastrous side effects on developing fetuses, leading to thousands of children being born with disabilities. This could have been avoided if the pharmaceutical companies had conducted thorough tests on the drug's impact on fetuses before releasing it into the market. On a similar note, several unethical trials have been conducted on unsuspecting human subjects. For example, the Tuskegee Syphilis Study, a clinical trial conducted in the United States from 1932 to 1972, was designed to study the natural history of syphilis in African American men. The patients were not informed of their diagnosis, were not given penicillin (a widely-used cure for syphilis at that time), and their treatment was deliberately withheld for several decades, resulting in the deaths of many of the patients and their family members. These incidents reveal that people'sfaith in the integrity of the medical industry may have been misplaced and that there have been instances where medical science has been more concerned with profits than with the health and well-being of patients.\nIn conclusion, it is safe to say that while medical science has benefited humans greatly in various aspects, it is imperative that people do not place an excessive amount of trust on it. It is noteworthy that medical science is not infallible, and that it is not a panacea to every malaise. Instead, individuals ought to integrate preventative measures into their lifestyles in order to maintain healthy lives, while also engaging in responsible research practices that prioritize the well-being of human subjects. By doing so, the numerous benefits medical science has provided will continue to aid individuals, without the negative consequences that excessive faith may bring.",
                "esearch is another area where people's blind faith in medical science may prove to be a potential threat. Given the pace at which medical science is being developed, the processes and careful assessment that follow each new discovery may err on the side of caution. This means that someone who prematurely uses untested treatments could suffer from dangerous side effects or even death. An illustration of this was seen in the 1990s, when doctors prescribed fen-phen, a combination of fenfluramine and phentermine, a weight-loss technique. The success of the drug led to a rush for its prescription, which later revealed unpleasant side effects such as pulmonary hypertension and heart valve damage, in some cases leading to death. The episode served as a cautionary tale about over-reliance on newly discovered treatments, many of which lack meticulous research and development. It is crucial that people understand that medical science is a field that hinges on the correct implementation of treatments in the correct setting, dosage and circumstances. Any attempt to deviate from these could have severe, sometimes catastrophic consequences.\nTo conclude, while it would be unreasonable to assert that medical science is entirely useless or harmful, it should be viewed as one aspect of a multifaceted solution to the most pressing global problems. The hasty, unsupervised reliance placed upon it has the potential to not only create a ripple effect of consequences, but to foster a sense of complacency towards ever-growing preventable disease epidemics. It is therefore crucial that people embrace a balanced way of thinking, in which they thoroughly investigate the side effects and viability of treatments before using them in order to assign an adequate amount of trust to the field of medical science."

            "prompt": "IS IMMIGRATION THE KEY SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF AGEING POPULATIONS? ",
            "human_gen_truncate": "hild-rearing. In France and the Scandinavian countries, which have some of the highest fertility rates in Europe, couples are greatly assisted by the government. A French mother has at least 16 weeks of paid maternity leave as well as guaranteed job security and \u2013 if she has a third child \u2013 a monthly stipend of up to 1,000 Euros for a year. Similarly, in Norway, women are entitled to 10 months of paid maternity leave at their full salary or a year with compensation being about 80% of their salary. Since the policies have been in place for decades, the country'sfertility rates are approaching 2.1, roughly the point where a population is self-sustaining, thereby reducing the need for immigration. Clearly, it is evident that boosting the fertility rate would have a far more pronounced effect on mitigating the effects of an ageing population in the long run.\nNext, there is a trend that is being observed in today'sworld, especially in developed countries and that is the company'swillingness to hire older people. Many organisations recognize that there is a wealth of experience in the elderly that generally goes untapped. Firms organize workshops and skills training programmes to help the elderly remain relevant in the workplace in order to tap on these existing skill sets. This, in turn, renders immigration unnecessary. Examples of such initiatives can be observed in the US, where an association of non-profit groups and the government hold seminars targeted at helping older people hone their skills to increase their employability. In addition, due to the array of retirement options that allow employees to transit gradually to retirement, along with other benefits such as flexible schedules, vetted back-up eldercare and low-impact exercise classes, the National Institute of Health (NIH) of the United States has consistently been ranked as one of the best companies for older workers. This could explain why more than half of their 20,000 workers are aged 50 years or older. These measures would prove to be superfluous, however, if the retirement age is not raised. Across the world, the statutory retirement age has different legal implications: in some countries like Singapore, the retirement age prevents older workers who have not reached the retirement age from being unfairly retrenched on the pretext of old age, while in others workers are guaranteed a pension if they retire upon reaching retirement age. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), many developed countries have already passed legislation that would increase the retirement age in their countries to at least 67 years from 65 by 2050. Ultimately, raising the retirement age will help to address the problem of a dwindling workforce as well as the impending pension crisis. The notion that the elderly can still contribute meaningfully to the workforce and the economy should be popularised, and the necessary changes should be made to re-integrate them back into the workforce.\nIt is also crucial that governments promote active and healthy ageing through public awareness campaigns and education. Indisputably, a rapidly ageing population will place greater demands on the healthcare system. The World Health Organization warns that the social impact of population ageing could be enormous. It predicts a big rise in cancers, coronary heart disease, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases related to ageing. Health experts are also worried that as people get older, they could become more prone to an increasing number of debilitating conditions unless they keep themselves physically active. In Singapore'scontext, research by the University of Washington'sInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggest that Singaporeans spent an average of eight years in ill health even as life expectancy increased to 82. Additionally, research by Duke-NUS Medical School suggests that the percentage of those over 60 years of age suffering from three or more chronic health conditions had more than doubled, from 19.8% in 2009 to 37% in 2017. What this necessarily means is that healthcare systems have had to devote more resources to addressing the needs of the elderly, many of whom will be in and out of hospices. To make matters worse, healthcare costs are on the steady rise and the elderly and their caregivers are struggling to afford essential treatments. Policies which place greater emphasis on community-based care and the prevention and management of chronic ailments are thus more pertinent than ever. Countries and their leaders have responded to this astronomical challenge by publicly funding the healthcare system, best exemplified by England. It subsidizes elderly patients\" medical care expenses through the National Healthcare System and has implemented various programmes like the National Retention Strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment for the elderly. Closer to home, Singapore'sMinistry of Health has introduced a slew of campaigns and financial schemes, such as the $3 billion Action Plan for Successful Ageing, co-payment insurance schemes like Medisave and Medishield to help the elderly cope with medical expenses for age-related ailments. These initiatives will indeed go a long way in addressing the social impacts of a rapidly ageing population.\nIn short, population ageing is in a state of flux today. It is also an intractable problem with no magic silver bullet to solve the issue. As many countries start to experience its pervasive effects, it is vital to consider mitigating the negative aspects of it via a multi-pronged approach, instead of relying on immigration solely to solve the problems associated with population ageing. While immigration seems like the fastest, most feasible way to replace the loss in working adults, in the long run, it may turn out to cause more harmful than beneficial, not to mention that a country cannot depend entirely on immigration as it may not be permanent. Other alternative solutions such as boosting fertility rates, encouraging skills upgrading and providing healthcare and financial support to the elderly should be employed in tandem. Notwithstanding this, immigration, at the moment serves as the most efficient and pragmatic way to supplement the ageing population, but ideally, it has to be complementary to other alternate solutions discussed to inculcate a culture where \"grey is the new gold\".",

This effect could be particularly pronounced in countries where the elderly population size is rapidly increasing. In these countries, a high influx of immigrants could help avoid a demographic catastrophe that could lead to the complete collapse of social welfare systems such as healthcare and pensions.\n\nHowever, there are also potential downsides to relying on immigration to address the problem of an ageing population. Firstly, there may be a negative perception of immigrants among the local population. This can affect their ability to integrate into society and could potentially lead to social unrest. Secondly, there may be a loss of cultural identity as a result of too many immigrants coming into the country. Thirdly, there may be issues related to the exploitation of migrant workers by employers that need to be addressed. Fourthly, the integration of some immigrants into society may prove difficult, particularly if there are language barriers, religious differences or cultural gaps.\n\nIn conclusion, immigration can be a key solution to the issue of ageing populations, but the effectiveness of this approach will depend on the specific circumstances of the country and its people. Immigration can help to bring in younger workers and replenish the workforce, whilst alleviating the cost burdens of an ageing population. However, in implementing this solution, policymakers must also take into account the potential downsides of immigration, such as the loss of cultural identity and resistance from local populations.

The Scandinavian countries have enjoyed some success in this area, with policies such as affordable childcare and the prioritizing of family friendly workplaces. Raising the retirement age is another option to be considered, as it can lead to a longer productive lifespan and more extensive contributions to the economy. In addition, improving the healthcare system, promoting active ageing, and increasing productivity are also possibilities that could alleviate the negative consequences of ageing populations. For instance, in Japan, the combination of a good healthcare system, active ageing policies, and technological advances, has allowed the elderly to live independently in their own homes and avoid putting a significant strain on the economy and the healthcare sector. It is clear that no single solution will suffice in addressing the impending demographic squeeze, but rather a comprehensive, multi-faceted approach will be necessary.\nIn conclusion, while immigration remains one of the ways to tackle the challenges of an ageing population, governments should approach it with caution and address the potential issues that it may bring about. It is not necessarily a silver bullet solution and should be supplemented with other strategies. Governments should be considering a comprehensive approach that includes policies such as improving healthcare, encouraging more births, promoting productivity, and active aging, among others.

Improving healthcare services is also key to assisting an ageing population as there will be an increasing demand for healthcare services, including long-term care, as the population ages. All of these measures can be implemented alongside carefully crafted immigration policies to ensure a balanced approach to tackling the problem of an ageing population.\nIn conclusion, while immigration can be an effective method to counter the negative economic consequences of a rapidly ageing population, it is not without problems. Therefore, it is crucial for policymakers to not view immigration policies as a silver bullet.

For instance, the Japanese government has proposed \"work-life integration\" policies, extending parental leave policies and providing other incentives to encourage young couples to have more children. This allows governments to maintain the native cultural identity, provide hope and a sense of continuity to its people. Raising the retirement age is another possible solution. By lengthening the time people are expected to contribute to the workforce, governments can accommodate the reduced labour force without having to rely solely on immigrants. This has been done in developed economies like Singapore, where the retirement age was raised from 62 to 65. This helps to sustain an adequate tax base to support the increasing health care costs. Finally, improving the healthcare system and living conditions will allow people to live longer, healthier lives, meaning that the burden on the working population to support the elderly will be reduced. This has been done in European nations such as Sweden, where preventative medicine is emphasized, and people are encouraged to live healthier lifestyles. \nThe issue of ageing populations is complex, and immigration cannot be seen as the lone solution. While it has the potential to alleviate some of the negative consequences, it can also create additional challenges such as cultural clashes and labour market imbalances. Thus, a balanced approach incorporating other solutions such as encouraging childbirth and raising the retirement age would be important to mitigate the effects of an ageing population. It is important for governments to recognise that immigration is just one part of a larger suite of policies that should be employed to effectively and sustainably confront issues related to an ageing population.",
                "hild-rearing, such as by offering tax incentives, extending parental leave and providing affordable childcare services. Japan is one such country that provides a good example of this, with her government offering families generous financial incentives starting from childbirth, as well as increasing affordable childcare facilities to promote a higher birth rate. By doing so, countries can hope to increase the labour force by providing new manpower, reducing the need to encourage immigration in order to replenish the labour pool. Raising the retirement age is another potential solution, which would increase the number of working citizens available, and reduce pressure on the social security systems as well as a shortage of manpower. Although some governments have even suggested increasing retirement age to as much as the mid-70s, many people may have chronic health issues that limit their ability to work, so this method might not be a universally applicable solution. Lastly, another solution would be to make healthcare services more efficient and accessible to both the aging population and the general population. By doing so, countries can reduce the burden on healthcare services as well as safeguard the productivity of the labour force by keeping them healthy and fitted for work. In essence, this means employing best practices in the healthcare industry in an effort to increase the quality of care patients receive. If countries can afford to invest in these solutions, there will be an eventual decrease in their dependence on immigration and foreign labour to compensate for an ageing population.\nIn conclusion, while some may tout immigration as the key solution to the problem of ageing populations, it is by no means the most effective method. Competition for jobs between new immigrants and locals may be stiff, cultural differences may result in social and political tensions, and there could be a lack of empathy between the two groups due to ideological differences. Importantly, governments must adopt a multi-dimensional approach to alleviate the problem of ageing populations. Such measures could include incentivising childbirth, increasing the efficiency of healthcare services, and raising the retirement age. Through a well-coordinated effort, countries can eventually reduce their dependence on immigration and foreign labour to replenish the shrinking workforce and ensure sustainable economic growth for the future.",

France, for example, has one of the most extensive family support systems in the world, boasting of comprehensive parental leave schemes and a monthly cash transfer to parents of young children. Raising the retirement age can also mean that older workers are encouraged to stay in the workplace, contributing to society and the economy while also helping to maintain the labour force. Governments may also invest more in healthcare and disability support so that those who are ageing or unable to work are still able to lead fulfilling and meaningful lives. All of these measures have the potential to supplement the ageing population, but the challenge is to find the right balance between the societal costs and benefits of each policy.\nIn conclusion, while immigration has been touted as one of the solutions to the burgeoning problem of ageing populations, it is not without its share of consequences, such as wage depression, social tensions and cultural conflicts. Consequently, it is important for governments to carefully calibrate their immigration policies and ensure that they have a strategic approach to managing their ageing populations.

As life expectancy increases, it makes sense to raise the retirement age so that older workers can remain active and productive for a longer period of time, thus helping to mitigate the labour shortage. Finally, improving healthcare is another way to tackle the problem of an ageing population. By ensuring that the elderly can remain healthy and active for longer, it will reduce the burden on healthcare services and promote economic productivity while enabling the elderly to live full and meaningful lives.\nIn conclusion, while immigration is often touted as a key solution to the problem of ageing populations, it is not a panacea without its downsides. There are many other solutions that governments can consider alongside immigration, such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age, and improving healthcare. Ultimately, it is only by considering and implementing a mix of these measures that governments can effectively address the problem of an ageing population, and ensure that economic growth, social cohesion, and individual well-being are all enhanced in tandem.",

In Singapore, various incentives such as the Baby Bonus Scheme have been introduced to encourage Singaporeans to have more children. While it may not be as immediate a solution as immigration, it is a sustainable method to address the ageing population issue.\nIn all, it is clear that immigration alone is not the key solution to the issue of ageing populations. The strategy can bring about as many problems as it solves, such as social tensions and labour market competition. Other options, such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age and improving healthcare should be incorporated to address the problem.",

Japan is a prominent example of a developed country facing an ageing population that has emphasised the need for encouraging childbirth. Japan has introduced a range of measures aimed at assisting families and raising fertility rates, such as cash incentives, heavily subsidised child care and flexible work arrangements. Such policies can contribute towards promoting a culture of childbirth and establish the necessary infrastructure to support families and children, thereby helping to mitigate the negative effects of population ageing.\nAside from this, raising the retirement age is another solution that governments can consider. One such example would be the German government, which in recent years has made extensive revisions to its social security and pensions system. The government has implemented various measures, including an increase in the retirement age and a supplementation of pension incomes, which has resulted in a delayed departure of workers from the labour market. This, in turn, has helped to supplement the nation\u2019s labour force, helping to ease the burden of Germany\u2019s ageing population.\nFinally, countries could also consider investing more heavily in health care, as medical advancements have helped to increase life expectancies and prolong working lives. Improving healthcare infrastructure, providing access to a wider range of medical services, and investing in research can help to reduce the healthcare burdens associated with ageing populations.\nIn conclusion, there is no single solution to the problem of ageing populations. While immigration can be a part of the solution, it is not a silver bullet - its drawbacks are numerous, including potential wage depression and social tensions. Governments should adopt an integrated approach to tackle the issue, utilising a range of complementary solutions such as promoting childbirth, raising the retirement age, enhancing healthcare infrastructure, and implementing immigration policies with caution.",

Policymakers can also look to alternative strategies to increase productivity, such as increasing automation and enhancing workforce training opportunities. Healthcare, too, can be improved to mitigate the burdens of an ageing population on the healthcare system.\nIn conclusion, immigration, while a potential solution to address the problem of ageing populations, is not without its problems. Policymakers must look beyond this quick fix and consider alternative solutions that could address the challenges of an ageing population, such as encouraging childbirth, raising the retirement age and improving healthcare. Countries must weigh the costs and benefits of immigration and consider a measured approach to foster social harmony while still meeting demographic needs. A holistic approach integrating various strategies would be preferable to relying solely on immigration or any one single solution. Ultimately, the way forward in tackling ageing populations may yield different combinations of solutions in different contexts."

This has allowed topics ranging from hot-button issues such as capital punishment and voting rights to those mundane or alien to the average viewer like vaccinations and elections in Mexico and India, to be covered in segments as long as ten to 20 minutes. It also brutally exposes certain contradictions, hypocrisies and errors which public figures make, in ways that mainstream news stations cannot do. In an extreme case, actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen acted as fake interviewers in \"documentaries\" like \"The Ali G Show\" and \"Who Is America?\" to coax politicians out of their scripted messages. For instance, in an episode of \"Who Is America?\", Baron Cohen managed to get former US Vice President Dick Cheney\u2014a controversial person due to his involvement in the CIA'suse of torture on suspects\u2014to openly endorse waterboarding. In another episode, he convinces gun lobbyists in the US to support arming children as young as three years old. The use of comedy and satire in these cases show that humour can play a significant role in society in making news entertaining and accessible to people and even in some cases, more accurate.\nNonetheless, there is a time and place for everything and there are certainly occasions where humour ought to play a limited role, or no role at all. In extremely serious and solemn situations such as funerals and court cases, there is not much place for humour. Humour isalsoof little to no value when it is used inappropriately or insensitively. Mocking people for things like race, religion, gender, height, weight, age and disability, for instance, is bullying, because it derives selfish pleasure at the expense of innocent people. Furthermore, it may cause harm to the victims beyond just normal hurt\u2014they might suffer from alienation, depression and may even attempt suicide.Likewise, racist or sexual jokes that are likely to offend others should be avoided, especially in today'shighly globalized world where societies are more diverse than ever. A tactless comment made without any real harmful intent may still be taken the wrong way and this can cause or perpetuate social prejudice and tensions. The comparison that Italian politician Roberto Calderoli made between Italy'sblack minister of integration and an orangutan example, was claimed to have no malicious intent.However, that does not change the fact that such a remark serves to reinforce the racist mindsets which are a major problem in multicultural Italy, and might create a backlash from the insulted group that could spin out of control. For instance, the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shootings in France was a response to the newspaper'spublication of a cartoon that mocked Prophet Muhammad.People have to be careful about how they use humour as the consequences can be damaging if they cross the line. Therefore,there is a time and place for humour, and occasions where it is less significant and indeed, best not to be used.\nIn essence, humour plays a significant part of our communications and ourlives, but it is significant only in certain scenarios and when used appropriately. In more solemn and sensitive scenarios, humour becomes less important as its use is minimised or even eliminated due to social and cultural sensitivities. Ultimately, some types of humour are more meaningful than others.

            "human_gen_truncate": "outdoors and for those who live in remote region. Although the plan to promote self-empowered education was promising, on hindsight, there were many doubts that arose regarding the development of the initiative in rural areas. For example, in Peru, over 800,000 low-cost laptops were distributed to children, but the direct benefits were not felt due to a myriad of problems, from ill-prepared rural teachers who were unable to fathom, much less teach, with the machines; software bugs that were not fixed affecting the learning; to the lack of electricity in the rural areas and schools to power the laptops. These concerns mar the alluring prospect that technology could potentially eliminate the problem of poverty, and highlight the importance of addressing the other issues that exist on the fringe of the main issue of poverty, such as providing basic infrastructure reassessing the government.\nAs aforementioned, the quality of the government has to be assessed before tackling the problem of poverty, as the reality is that the existence of corruption within most bureaucracies of developing countries makes the elimination of poverty an intimidating task. A country led by inept leaders generally suffers from greater instability and has poorly developed infrastructure. Under their governance, there is mismanagement of resources, resulting in poor and inadequate public services such as healthcare and education, which are vital aspects for a country'sdevelopment. In addition, even if technology were to assist in providing aid in times of need via social media platforms and the Internet, the donations and resources channelled from developed countries to the developing countries might not directly help the poor who need them the most. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, a significant proportion of food, medical, and monetary aid failed to reach the victims of the disaster as the Indonesian military looted the essential supplies to sell them in the black market at inflated prices, while the government pocketed the money. The ineffectiveness of technology in eradicating poverty is further reiterated here, what aid offered to poorer countries can be siphoned by the leaders to improve their wealth and status. Therefore, apart from technology, a call for action is certainly required in this instance, to exterminate corruption and put in place proper policies to ensure that aid is rendered to the poor, lest the impoverished be mired further in poverty.\nNext, international alliance and collective will play a major role in improving the current state of poverty. Various governmental and non-governmental organisations at national and community levels can work in tandem to tackle some of the major issues faced by the poor, such as healthcare concerns, and the lack of basic education, as these will eventually go a long way in assisting them to secure jobs, equipped with skills and also in the pink of health. Furthermore, by providing the poor with basic necessities, they would be able to utilize technology appropriately and to its fullest capabilities. UNICEF has been building national capacities for primarily healthcare. Around 270 million children, just over 14% of all children in developing countries have no access to healthcare services. As such, a global leader in vaccine supply, UNICEF purchases and helps distribute vaccines to over 40% of children in developing countries. It has also provided oral rehydration salts for 10 cents per packet to children suffering from dehydration. This two-pronged approach in engaging government aid families is still adopted by UNICEF today, reducing child mortality for those under 5, by almost 50% to date. Initiates to promote education have also been taken as they are key signifiers of positive economic development. The MacArthur Foundation, the Mastercard Foundation and the Human Dignity Foundation are collaborating through partnership in strengthening Innovative Practice in secondary education, issuing a second call for proposals to support lifelong learning opportunities and life skills for underserved youth between the ages of 12 and 19 in East Africa, Nigeria, and India. It is an indisputable fact that in the long run, education would serve well in providing people with better economic opportunities, higher agricultural productivity and cultural thinking skills to help them revenge their current plight and escape the straitjacket of poverty. Clearly, such measures would stand poverty-stricken people in good stead and enhance their quality of life, making it far more effective solution to the problem of global poverty.\nWith all of the above in mind, it must be noted that ever since its use to prominence in the early 20thcentury, technology has been a key aspect in our day-to-day lives, strengthening communications, and bringing work productivity to levels unparalleled in the last century. While technological developments have indeed contributed to mitigating poverty to some extent, the presence of other factors such as corrupt governments and lack of basic education and infrastructure impedes its progress in making a profound difference in the lives of the poor. As such, technology alone cannot be the only solution to the problem of global poverty, because if the root causes of poverty are not addressed, technology can and will only play second fiddle to the battle of poverty. What the poor require is not the complete removal of technology from their lives, nor is it the bombardment of technology in their society. They need to be exposed to technology at a gradual pace, along with other complementary external aid and reform actions, such as increased education and communication in the government. Essentially, a more calibrated approach towards tackling the problem would produce a desired outcome in the decades to come.",

Digital payment systems, such as mobile money and electronic benefit transfers, have enabled cash transfer programs, providing economic support to families, elderly people, and other vulnerable groups. The use of biometric identification systems has also helped ensure program integrity, reducing fraud and improving targeting. Additionally, technology has enabled the creation of monitoring and evaluation systems, enabling governments and organizations to track program performance and measure impact.\n\nDespite the potential of technology, however, it is not the complete solution to ending global poverty. There are numerous challenges that need to be addressed for technology to be effective in poverty eradication. One of the key challenges is the digital divide, which refers to the gap between those who have access to technology and those who do not. Many people in developing countries lack access to technology due to factors such as cost, infrastructure, and digital literacy. This limits their ability to benefit from the opportunities offered by technology, perpetuating poverty.\n\nAnother challenge facing technology in poverty eradication is the issue of inequality. While technology has the potential to reduce poverty by creating new opportunities, it can also exacerbate inequality by creating winners and losers. For instance, those who lack the skills or resources to capitalize on new opportunities offered by technology risk falling behind, while those who are better equipped to take advantage of technology gain a competitive edge. This can further widen the gap between the rich and poor, and undermine efforts to reduce poverty.\n\nIn conclusion, technology offers immense potential in the fight against global poverty. It can enable economic growth, improve health and education outcomes, and create effective social safety nets. However, it is not the complete solution to ending poverty, as it is constrained by challenges such as the digital divide and inequality. Efforts must be made to address these challenges to enable technology to be harnessed to its fullest potential in poverty eradication.",

While such technology has indeed had a positive impact in bridging the education gap for children in underdeveloped communities, the sad reality is that many of these communities might not even have access to basic necessities such as electricity and water. The lack of infrastructure can also impede the distribution of the laptops on a large scale and renders them futile to solve the problem of global poverty. Therefore, it is unfortunate that while technology has potential in bridging education gaps, it is still limited by the hindrances to infrastructure and extenuating circumstances like poor governance or lack of education.\nIn conclusion, while technology has great potential to improve the quality of life of those living in impoverished communities, its effectiveness is limited by several factors such as limited infrastructure, poor governance, lack of education and problems it creates in the industry. It is, therefore, crucial that a multi-pronged approach is adopted in tackling the issue of global poverty, instead of over-reliance on technology alone. By weighing the pros and cons of technology, we can then utilise it more efficiently in conjunction with other solutions like education or social welfare schemes. As with any new solution proposed, we must thoroughly scrutinise it and adapt it to the specific context of the area in which it is being used, so as to maximise its effects and ensure that it becomes a sole solution to global poverty.",

This could potentially level the playing fields and raise the income levels of those at the bottom of the pyramid.\nHowever, technology alone is not enough, and its effectiveness in solving the problem of global poverty is hampered by a lack of well-designed policies, corrupt governance and unscrupulous business practices. For example, foreign aid to developing countries have been known to be used to line the pockets of politicians, instead of being used to benefit the communities that are in need of support. This would mean that no matter how well-intentioned companies or philanthropists are, the wealth that is shared, would not be reflective of the impact that was intended, and a greater effort needs to be made to safeguard the public purse and ensure that aid is used efficiently to achieve its intended aims.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that technology can potentially address the issue of global poverty through its increased access to basic necessities and the provision of education, among other things. However, technology is not a panacea to the myriad problems that the poor face every day, and it would take more than just cutting-edge solutions to lift people out of poverty.

This initiative has successfully empowered children in underprivileged areas with knowledge and broadened their perspective on life, hopefully lifting them out of their current predicament of global poverty. Yet, despite all of these technological advancements, the root problem of global poverty still persists. \nSeveral factors have hindered the progress of these technological advancements, preventing it from being effective in eradicating global poverty. First and foremost, poor governance and endemic corruption prevent aid from reaching those in need. While technology has made a tremendous impact, its effectiveness ultimately depends on the people that execute and administer them. It is no secret that many people living in poverty are at a disadvantage due to governmental neglect and corruption. Secondly, the issue of education plays a significant role in determining the effectiveness of technological advancements. It is highly unlikely that poor people living in remote areas will have education levels adequate enough to operate technology. Therefore, it can be concluded that to achieve development through technology, the government must address the larger systemic issues of governance and education infrastructure in poverty-stricken areas. \n\nIn conclusion, technology has made considerable strides in alleviating the problem of global poverty. It has helped increase agricultural production, food security, and education in underprivileged communities. Social media platforms have also played a pivotal role in raising awareness of global poverty and increasing support.

Corruption and political instability can derail the implementation of technological solutions and prevent them from reaching the intended beneficiaries. Developing countries might not have the resources or expertise to exploit technological advancements fully. Investings in education and creating an environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship are crucial in propelling any technological solutions for poverty reduction to work effectively. Hence, governments must invest in human capital, promote good governance and create an environment that fosters social and technological innovation.\nTo conclude, while technology has the potential to combat global poverty, it is not a silver bullet. It can provide greater access to basic necessities and global community support, but it also has its limitations, which must be critically evaluated. The success of technological solutions to poverty reduction will depend on addressing the underlying causes of poverty, such as inequality and political instability, as well as creating an environment that fosters innovation and entrepreneurship.",

For instance, poorer countries lack the infrastructure to support the digital platforms sufficiently. Without proper telecommunications systems, the availability of devices, networks and sound policies that promote broadband deployment, the integration of technology would be inadequate. Moreover, digital literacy is also an issue, which remains the biggest challenge to widespread access to and use of digital technologies among the poor. Simply providing the hardware alone may not be sufficient if they lack the necessary skills to use the technology to their advantage, such as learning how to surf the internet, or handling the laptop when faced with hardware malfunctions. These are the problems that must be addressed, and while technology plays a crucial role in alleviating global poverty, it is still reliant on these supporting factors.\nIn conclusion, while technology is a powerful tool in our efforts to combat global poverty, it is not the panacea to rid our society of poverty. This is because technology, while having an impressive ability to solve poverty-related problems, is dependent on various contingent factors such as governance, education, digital literacy and infrastructure. Governments and policymakers need to work with the wider society to create a supportive environment that encourages the development and utilization of technology to combat poverty.

Despite all the great technological advancements, global poverty persists because of the lack of education and poor governance over countries. One of the biggest reasons for the persistence of poverty is poor governance and corruption in impoverished countries. Weak institutional frameworks impede the effectiveness of technology in bringing about change, and this is exemplified by the fact that despite large investments in technology by donors to many developing countries, little progress has been made in reducing poverty. Technology is only useful when it is integrated in a larger framework of policies related to poverty, education, sanitation, healthcare, institutional and political reforms. Furthermore, for technology to be applied appropriately in poverty alleviation programmes, it must reflect the economic and social context of each country to help improve the quality of life for those entrenched in poverty.\n\nIn conclusion, while technology has the potential to provide solutions to eradicate global poverty by improving access to basic necessities such as food, water, education, and healthcare, it is not a comprehensive solution by itself. The problematic implementation of technological advancements often results in exacerbating the problems of poverty, inequality and unemployment.

While these initiatives seem to be effective in bridging the digital gap and providing education to the less fortunate, they are constrained by certain extenuating circumstances that make them less effective in eradicating global poverty. Developing countries may lack the infrastructure to support such initiatives, due to poor governance that hinders the implementation of proper policies and plans. Moreover, countries without access to electricity will be unable to use these devices despite them being available, thereby rendering them ineffective. Additionally, there is also the issue of the digital divide. People from low-income families may not have access to modern gadgets or the internet, making it difficult to partake in online educational programmes. These programmes may also be limited by a lack of bandwidth, rendering them slow, which may discourage the students who may have otherwise wanted to partake in them.\nUltimately, while technology has the potential to help alleviate poverty, its effectiveness is hindered by several factors. Good governance, coupled with policies that create an enabling environment for technology to flourish can help to ensure its efficiency. The promotion of education, access to capital, and strengthening of social protections through measures like microfinancing, are catalysts that will enable people to take advantage of the opportunities that the technology brings forth. Investing in these areas, along with technology, is more likely to fuel sustainable, long-term economic growth, and alleviate the problems of global poverty.",

With the increased accessibility and reduced costs of technology in the future, more individuals from impoverished families will be able to receive formal education, exposed to ideas from around the world and eventually reverse the trend of global poverty. \nHowever, it is important to note that technology alone cannot effectively eradicate global poverty. Poor governance, corruption, and lack of education infrastructure are just some of the larger issues that cannot be solved by the use of technology alone. For example, if a government were corrupt or inefficient on using these technologies to serve the poor, then these efforts would be futile. Thus, there must be a concerted effort between governments and technology-based organizations to ensure equitable distribution of these resources, to reach as many disadvantaged individuals as possible. This multi-pronged approach that involves a combination of the development of effective policies, active involvement of the private sector, technological innovations and scaling up of humanitarian aid will be more likely to improve the living standards of those living in poverty. \nIn conclusion, whilst technology can undoubtedly be a useful tool in the fight against global poverty, it is not a comprehensive solution. There is much work to be done to ensure equitable distribution of technology and to address other important social factors such as governance, education, and well-being.

This enhances the effectiveness of education in developing nations as children are able to study not only in school but also at home. Through this initiative, the poor are given greater access to education and are better equipped to break out of the poverty cycle. The positive effects of technology in this aspect cannot be denied. Nonetheless, its effectiveness in improving educational standards may be limited by factors such as lack of infrastructure and poor governance. For example, some areas in developing nations may still not have access to basic necessities such as water and electricity, making it challenging for students to learn. Furthermore, schools in some countries may not have enough computers or even electricity supply to run them, rendering the \"One Laptop per Child\" campaign futile. Additionally, poor governance may lead to corruption and undermine the effectiveness of educational initiatives, deterring people from learning and perpetuating the cycle of poverty.

Moreover, the introduction of mobile banking has also benefited the poor by allowing them access to financial services without the need for a physical bank. This means that they can save money and manage their finances securely, efficiently and cheaply. For instance, in the developing world, mobile banking systems have enabled people like small farmers to receive payments electronically instead of cash, reducing their reliance on the unscrupulous middlemen who levied steep fees and often cheated them out of their honest earnings. With the advent of mobile money transfers, it also means that they can access money more easily, since it is not required for them to have a bank account, which they often do not have.\n\nHowever, despite the visible benefits of these technological advancements, it is important to recognize that technology alone is not a magical solution to the problem of global poverty. This is because there are still boundaries to their adoption within impoverished communities. Education, good governance and political stability are key elements that would help these people get the full benefit of technological advancements. Those who live in rural areas, for instance, do not possess the knowledge or have access to the internet, which means they would not be able to utilise the advantages of technology to improve their lives. Additionally, the problem of defective governments who do not prioritize the needs of their people cannot be underestimated; projects these governments undertake may end up as white elephants without the proper implementation and supervision of the plans. Moreover, several impoverished countries may be forced to take on debt, which they are unable to repay, which leads to a cycle of poverty, domestic upheaval and sometimes violence.\n\nTo conclude, there are certainly benefits to using technological advancements as a way to mitigate global poverty, these potential methods are limited in the absence of good governance, education and political stability.

In Germany, millions of dollars are pumped into vocational training annually, which the majority of post-secondary students pursue instead of university degrees. As a result, they are equipped with the experience and practical skills desired by employers, and this has helped keep youth unemployment at bay at 7% as compared to other European countries with an average of 40%, as of 2015. Therefore, it is not completely accurate to claim that formal education has not done enough to help students become ready for today'seconomic challenges, because one must take into account the fact that formal education is similarly evolving to adapt to these challenges.\nFurthermore, in light of the increasing racial and religious divides present throughout the world today, formal education is in fact doing its part in minimizing or at least, reducing, these divisions in culturally diverse societies. Most educational systems considers the holistic development of students in all levels of education, implementing various programmes and encouraging students to take up extra-curricular activities. At the elementary level, the Child Development Project (CDP) is a programme spanning multiple states in America, which aims to foster children'sethical, social and intellectual development. Reports have shown that students in CDP schools are more skilled at resolving interpersonal conflicts and engage in more pro-social behaviour. Additionally, extra-curricular activities such as sports, performing arts or community clubs not only help build resilience and resourcefulness, but also help inculcate soft skills such as teamwork amongst students as well, which are definitely vital for surviving in an economy that no longer guarantees job security. However, a more important purpose of these programmes is that they help foster social integration, as students gain a sense of pride and belonging to their community and its people. They also become more tolerant of citizens who are racially, ethnically or religiously different from themselves, which play a part in reducing the alienation of the minority. This is especially important in today'sdangerous world, where terrorism has spread in a large pan due to the isolation of misunderstood or stereotyped communities. These programmes are a part of formal education, and thus it cannot be claimed that formal education has done little to ready the students for today'ssocial challenges as well.\nTo conclude, there is a certain truth to claims that some traditional formal education that focuses only on educating students knowledge have become outdated, and hence irrelevant in readying students for the current globalized world plagued with uncertainty and threat. However, there are other aspects of formal education in several societies \u2013 from the elementary to university levels \u2013 that have also evolved to tackle these social and economic challenges and have revealed considerably encouraging outcomes.

Moreover, having a society which is open to diversity attracts the investments of large multinational companies since it means that they are able to send in their professional expats much more easily. This explains why today'smost prosperous cities such as London, Singapore and New York are so welcoming to immigrants. Hence, since the trend towards diversity is what will drive future economic development in the world, it is a positive development.\nOn a more microscopic note, diversity in industries meaning competition as opposed to a single monopoly, is healthy. Competition drives producers to deliver better products and services and keep costs down. The liberalization of telecommunications in Singapore, for example, served to include Starhub and M1 together with Singtel. This move was to the ultimate benefit of consumers who received more choice and better quality. Therefore, diversity in industries improves efficiency in economies and is a positive development.\nAt first glance, one might think that the trend towards diversity in societies is beneficial because the cultural interactions between people can promote a greater understanding and respect between people of different races and religion. Indeed, the shift from ethnocentrism and stereotypes to a more global and multicultural society is a step in the right direction. However, it will be too optimistic to claim that everyone has understood one another and everyone is living harmoniously together. The influx of foreign cultures and values have alarmed cultural preservationists, leading to tensions and conflicts within societies. Radical Hindus, in India for example, have felt that western public displays of affection are unacceptable to traditional Indian culture so they annually harass or even attempt to forcefully marry young couples on Valentine'sDay. The French Law that bans headscarves and face veils in schools has also alienated many of France'sfive million Muslims. A few years back, rioting broke out in a Paris suburb when a police officer checked the identity papers of a fully veiled women. Indeed, social diversity brings about its own set of challenges and these problems are not easily solved. Therefore, while diversity may increase cultural understanding, the social strife it might cause does not make the trend towards diversity a necessarily positive one.\nIn essence, the movement towards diversity may be beneficial politically and economically but the social aspect needs to be examined more closely. Governments will have to embrace diversity but at the same time remain cautious at its negative aspects if they were to truly enjoy the fruits that diversity bear.",

The trend towards diversity can result in conflicts and misunderstandings. People from different backgrounds may hold different values, beliefs, and attitudes, which can lead to disagreements that may escalate to hostility and division. Furthermore, a lack of cultural sensitivity and understanding can exacerbate conflicts. For example, a caricature of a Prophet can lead to tensions among religious groups. Misunderstanding of cultural norms can also lead to conflicts such as wearing headscarves or any form of cultural dress.\n\nIn addition, diversity can lead to the marginalization of certain groups. In a diverse society, some groups may dominate others, leading to an imbalance of power and privilege. For example, in some countries, foreigners or minorities may experience discrimination in the workplace. It must be acknowledged that diversity is not a panacea for addressing societal inequalities entirely.\n\nNotwithstanding, the drawbacks of diversity can be minimized if addressed properly. Sensitivity training, cultural awareness programs, and policies promoting inclusivity can make interactions among diverse groups more positive, productive, and meaningful. Effective communication and empathy techniques can be incorporated into these programs to foster understanding among individuals from diverse backgrounds. Additionally, governments can provide policies that protect minority groups and promote their equality and access to opportunities. \n\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity is a positive development. The benefits of diversity, such as inclusivity, equity, personal growth, and development, creativity, and innovation, make it an essential component of modern society.

Therefore, diversity in media can help to connect with large audiences and provide fresh perspectives on current issues.\n\nHowever, despite these advantages of diversity, it is important to recognize that increased diversity can also lead to conflicts between groups with different social identities. When people of different cultures or ethnicities interact, sometimes they may hold beliefs that are incompatible with each other, resulting in misunderstandings and tension. In such situations, people tend to form groups that share a certain identity, which can contribute to social polarization and discrimination. For example, in 2016, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union as a result of anti-immigrant sentiment.

As people from different cultures, backgrounds and linguistic abilities come together, language and communication can pose a significant barrier. For example, differences in regional accents or linguistic backgrounds can hinder successful communication in a team setting. Additionally, differences in cultural values, beliefs and practices can often lead to misunderstandings and conflict. For instance, certain religious beliefs or cultural practices may not be accepted in some societies although the adherents consider it as fundamental. Furthermore, diversity can lead to stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination as people may hold certain preconceived notions about individuals based on their race, gender, or ethnicity. Such attitudes can lead to a lack of inclusivity and the formation of clique cultures in which certain groups are excluded. Therefore, while diversity is a positive development, it needs to be managed appropriately to ensure that everyone is respected and that their unique differences are celebrated.\n\nIn conclusion, while the trend towards diversity is largely positive, its negative implications should not be ignored. Admitting people from different socio-cultural contexts and linguistic backgrounds can lead to a range of perspectives and broader creativity.

Collaboration and cross-disciplinary work between cultures and ethnicity are also important in modern medicine and public health research, as people's genetic makeup can often affect certain outcomes, including diseases that are unique to certain populations. Therefore, the trend towards diversity does bring about fresh ideas and valuable innovation.\nDespite the advantages that diversity has, there are several concerns associated with it too. When people are used to living in a community that is largely homogenous, the introduction of a new and different culture can lead to misunderstandings and hostility. There have been cases of racially motivated attacks in countries like the USA and Germany on those who don't \"belong\". The xenophobic attacks have often been sparked by an increase in the number of refugees coming into the country. People who come from different cultures have different ways of speaking and behaving which can be perceived as rude or indecent by the host country. For instance, in Korea, it is considered rude for an individual to point using the index finger at another person. To the Koreans, this is a sign of disrespect, but to other regional people, it is a norm. Thus, diversity can lead to cultural misunderstandings and offending cultures' norms can often manifest as negative attitudes.\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity is generally a positive development that promotes fresh perspectives, innovation, and better representation in societies. It does, however, have its negative side to it too as it can lead to misunderstandings and intolerance.

In a diverse society, different cultures may have different norms, values, and beliefs. This can lead to misunderstandings, communication breakdowns, and even conflict. The challenge, therefore, is to promote mutual respect, understanding, and tolerance among diverse groups.\n\nAnother potential drawback of diversity is the possibility of inequality and discrimination. While diversity aims to promote equal opportunities and fairness, it may not always be achieved. In some cases, minority groups may face discrimination and prejudice, which can limit their opportunities and hinder their success. The challenge is to ensure that no one is left behind in the pursuit of diversity and that everyone has access to the same opportunities and resources.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity is a positive development as it promotes inclusivity, equity, personal growth, and innovation. However, there are also potential challenges, such as misunderstandings and discrimination, that need to be addressed. By promoting respect, understanding, and equality, we can harness the benefits of diversity and build a more harmonious and prosperous society.",

Diversity can bring together people with vastly different beliefs and values, which can result in clashes. For instance, religious and cultural differences can cause misunderstandings and disagreements. Additionally, diversity can lead to a lack of cohesion and shared identity as people may instead identify more strongly with their individual groups.\n\nAnother challenge is the potential for discrimination. Research has shown that although employers may claim to be seeking diversity, unconscious bias may result in certain groups being excluded or overlooked. Discrimination can also occur in schools and communities, leading to marginalization and social exclusion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the trend towards diversity is a positive development, it is not without challenges. There is a need to address the potential for conflict and discrimination, so that diversity can be harnessed to its full potential. It is essential for individuals, organizations, and societies to embrace diversity, learning from and celebrating each other's differences, to create a more inclusive and harmonious world.",

Firstly, it may lead to cultural clashes and misunderstandings, particularly in areas where cultural values differ significantly. This can lead to tension and conflict, which can negatively impact social cohesion. Furthermore, diversity may lead to the formation of ethnic enclaves and the tendency to self-segregate, creating pockets of exclusion and disunity.\n\nAdditionally, diversity can also create barriers to communication and understanding due to language differences, leading to miscommunications and misunderstandings. This can be particularly challenging in fields such as medicine and science, where clear communication is essential for effective outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, the trend towards diversity has both positive and negative aspects. While diversity can promote inclusivity, equity, personal growth, creativity, and innovation, it may also lead to cultural clashes, misunderstanding, exclusivity, and communication gaps. Therefore, it is essential to approach diversity with an open and inclusive mindset, embracing the benefits while finding ways to mitigate the potential drawbacks, to foster a more harmonious and equitable society."

This may lead to a change in many designs, building houses and commercial buildings shorter to prevent collapse, or using new, stronger materials in the building process.\nFurthermore, buildings of the future should be built to be as eco-friendly and sustainable as possible. Incorporating solar panels into the roofs and sides of buildings and creating systems where water is reused for a variety of purposes are currently underway. However, more can be done to increase the effectiveness of these systems, such as designing buildings to capture maximum sunlight, or incorporating localised water purification and collection plants, so that water can constantly be reused and recycled. Designers may even consider incorporating ways of collecting wind energy, placing these turbines at higher floors to capture large amounts of wind. These efforts to encourage sustainable living will gradually help to reduce our carbon footprint, hence restricting our impact on the environment, and reducing the negative impact of global warming.\nFinally, the rise of greying populations worldwide as well as growing urban populations means that cities of the future have to be built with greater inclusiveness for those with disabilities, as well as the elderly. The building of cities that incorporate the needs of the disabilities involve minor structural inclusions such as ramps and lifts to allow those in wheelchairs to move around easily, or even making doors slightly translucent, so that the deaf will be able to determine if someone is behind a door, before opening it. Although these are already present in some buildings, they need to be incorporated into all cities and spaces. Designers should be able to anticipate the needs of the people that will be living in the cities, and those with disabilities should not be overlooked. Cities of the future will need to have signs in Braille for the blind, larger walkways so that the deaf are able to walk side-by-side and sign to each other at the same time. Current cities are only being built to cater to 99% of the population, but we need to remember that the 1% is a crucial part of our communities and societies as well. Similarly, with our growing elderly population, urban designs should provide areas with high elderly populations, more hospitals and palliative care centres should be built, to cope with the greater demand for them. There have been trials in Europe merging childcare and eldercare centres, and this has been proven to be beneficial in the mental wellness of the elderly, as social interaction lowers the risk of dementia and depression. The merger and incorporation of these seemingly different facilities is indeed radical, but has proven to be beneficial to the most overlooked segments of urban cities today. Hence, designers of the future should consider similar ideas in order to cater for greater diversity in cities.\nIn essence, the cities of the future need not be designed completely differently. Instead, they should be designed with minor adjustments made to better suit the changing needs of the people in the time and age, incorporating new designs and innovations, while remaining inclusive and not neglecting any sector of society. In an age where the green agenda needs to take priority, cities need to be built in a way that they too can become carbon sinks for the world.

In many cities, housing is becoming increasingly unaffordable, pushing people out of the cities. Future cities need to be designed with innovative housing models that can support the growing population. Architects and city planners must come up with innovative designs to create density without compromising on living conditions. Some innovative models such as shared housing units, co-living ventures, and micro-apartments will enable individuals to gain access to living spaces that are affordable, which will make cities more accessible, inclusive, and equitable places.\n\nFinally, cities\u2019 planning must take into account the broader regional context to ensure that they are not isolated from the surrounding region. Planners must have a broader outlook on the impact of their decisions on areas beyond the city itself. For example, regional transportation systems and water supply must be taken into consideration, while regional development plans and environmental concerns such as land conservation and water use should be integrated into the planning of future cities.\n\nIn conclusion, urbanization has resulted in many environmental and infrastructure problems. Cities must be made more sustainable, efficient, and livable to accommodate the increasing population. The cities of the future need new ideas and innovative approaches to provide healthy living environments, ensure that everyone is included, and ultimately to build better communities.

Clearly, para-journalists pay little heed to more important issues in their bid to feed the insatiable need of their audience for entertainment and gossip. Against the backdrop of a parliament flailing in the face of Brexit, tabloids like the Daily Express have instead chosen to cover Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and her many controversies, even touting her as \"Duchess Difficult\". Are these media sources at least accurate in their reporting (never mind their obsession with covering the glitzy and glamorous) or do they compromise the truth in their pursuit of pleasure? It appears that tabloids often pay lip-service to the notion of truth \u2013 the feud narrative between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton has been thoroughly debunked by Buckingham Palace, and rumours about her being difficult with staff have not been verified with empirical evidence. It appears that parajournalism is a form of media which has taken its desire for entertaining material to the extreme, and completely forsaken the truth in the process. Unlike mainstream media, which often pushes a political agenda to further their own interests, para-journalists simply benefit from a readership that constantly desires entertainment. It would thus make sense for such forms of media to prioritize entertainment over telling the truth.\nFinally, I venture to argue that New Media, which refers to interactive digital media that incorporates two-way communication, tends to prioritise telling the truth over the amusement of its readership. Whether it successfully does so is another question. Alternative media like Wikipedia and Wikileaks for instance, have presenting the truth at the heart of what they do. Wikipedia allows its curious readership to discover the truth about a wide range of topics under the sun, whereas Wikileaks publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources with the intention of challenging narratives peddled by mainstream media. Evidently, rather than creating a fictional narrative that is meant to amuse, alternative media prefers to challenge conventional narratives with the intention of eventually uncovering the truth. This is because Wikipedia profits off telling the truth as users who trust its reliability and believe in its purpose donate an amount of USD $15 on average. That being said, social media platforms, which are also included under the umbrella term of \"New Media\", are also in danger of compromising the truth for entertainment. The nature of social media platforms and their business model means that algorithms pick up on the preferences of individual users, and thereafter promote articles or advertisements that it believes these individual users are inclined towards. This extends towards other issues in the public sphere when algorithms used by social media platforms contribute to confirmation bias; users are fed articles that reaffirm their existing views, which to a certain extent reaffirms them and brings about pleasure, be it in the form of self-righteous anger or otherwise. 47% of Conservatives are likely to see Facebook posts aligned to their own views, according to a Pews Research report. Again, as mediums under the umbrella term of \"New Media\" are so diverse in their motivations, whether New Media prioritises the truth over entertainment depends on how these motivations fit into their business model and align themselves with the profit incentive.\nIn a world where large media platforms seem increasingly obsessed with the hilarity of the trivial, and increasingly eager to broadcast their interest, it may appear that entertainment value has displaced the truth as a priority of the media. I venture to argue, however, that media networks are diverse and like individuals, cannot be tarred with the same brush. Their priorities are predicated on the priorities of their readership and their priorities as profit-generating businesses; if the public desires entertainment over truth, this is what the media will provide, for after all, we get the media that we deserve.",

People tend to share exciting or controversial news stories on social media platforms without any fact-checking, and the news goes viral. As a result, media outlets prioritize producing sensational and clickbait news to amass large followings on social media platforms.\n\nDespite the above-discussed issues, some media outlets still uphold the principles of journalism and prioritize truth over entertainment. These news organizations operate with a core objective of providing reliable and factual news to the public without any biases. They respect the journalistic ethics and integrity and strive to hold accountable those who deviate from it. However, such outlets often have fewer viewers and generate lower revenues as compared with entertainment-oriented news media.\n\nIn conclusion, the media has indeed prioritized entertainment over truth in recent years. The reason for this shift is multifaceted, ranging from competition, reliance on revenue from advertisements, social media, and the unwillingness of audiences to consume news that is not sensationalized. However, it is crucial that we recognize and address this issue since it affects the growth and sustainability of any society.

While para-journalism does have its role to play in pushing the boundaries on difficult issues, it tends to value entertainment over truth, which can be detrimental to public discourse.\n\nLastly, new media, which refers to platforms such as social media and online news sites, may have priorities that ironically reflect a change towards truth. Social media, while being instrumental in spreading disinformation and fake news, has also made possible the democratisation of information, where there are more sources of news and diverse voices than ever before.

Indeed, the media is ultimately a business, and media sources are dependent on their readership and income. The demands for sensational news and juicy gossip also make media sources more susceptible to prioritising entertainment. However, it is important to recognise the variegated motivations and priorities of different sources of media, and not fall into the trap of simplifying their actions as prioritising either entertainment or truth.",
                "ut human rights violations in the Maldives by Para-journalism site \"Daily Mail\", which suggests that their priority is less about truth, and more about what might grab the attention of their readers. However, it is worth noting that para-journalism is often differentiated from mainstream media because of its overt rejection of objectivity in favour of embracing subjectivity - so it might be unfair to suggest that sensationalism over truth is less forgivable in this sphere of media, when the priorities and criteria for success differ so markedly.\nThis brings us to \"New Media\", which is a relatively modern buzzword used to describe a range of online sources of media, from blogs to podcasts to social media platforms. Here, the priorities are even more diverse and hard to pin down. Some New Media sources are relentlessly concerned with the truth and watchdogging, regardless of its impact or entertainment value. For instance, non-profit news organisation ProPublica is, as of February 2020, running objective reports on the failed US healthcare system, and the ongoing legal battles surrounding allegations of sexual assault against high-profile figures like Harvey Weinstein to bring the truth to light. However, it is also true that New Media is often a space for sensationalism and entertainment value. YouTube stars, for example, rely on entertaining video content to attract views, shares, and subscriptions. Sites like Buzzfeed, originally a way of delivering \"clickbait\" content like \"23 Reasons Why Cats are Better than Dogs\", are now attempting to move towards serious news, although their reported concerns about their dependence on Facebook algorithms to drive viewership suggest that entertainment remains their ultimate priority. Regardless of these concerns, it is clear that New Media has vastly expanded our access to news and entertainment, and created opportunities for content creators to both generate income and amplify the voices of those underreported in mainstream sources.\nIn conclusion, while it is clear that the media cannot be reduced to a simple dichotomy between entertainment and truth, it is also undeniable that entertainment value is a factor that news sources must consider if they hope to be successful in today's media landscape. Nonetheless, this does not necessarily mean that truth is relegated to a secondary position in the priorities of journalism. Instead, it is important to recognise that the media is a multifaceted force, with different sources having different concerns and priorities. Only by engaging critically with media sources and the criteria for what counts as \"successful\" journalism can we hope to distinguish between the good and the bad, and ultimately demand better journalistic standards.",
                "ut the treatment of Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar by the military. This coverage has shifted the focus of the news report away from the Rohingyas and onto Amal Clooney. While such coverage may provide some form of light-hearted amusement, it also distracts from the important facts and issues that otherwise would have been highlighted. Para-journalistic media thus thrives on sensationalist news stories and appeals to the baser emotions of the public to gain attention, which ultimately leads to increased profit for their media outlets or brands. In this sense, it is apparent that entertainment takes precedence over truth.\n\nNew Media, which comprises internet-based sources such as social media platforms, bloggers or vloggers, have fundamentally changed the media landscape. New media sources do not have the same resources for covering breaking news as mainstream media. However, what they lack in resources, they make up for by seeking out stories and perspectives that do not fit into mainstream media's agenda. Unlike mainstream media, New Media aims to provide the public with raw and unfiltered news content that is free from the limitations imposed by commercial media entities. New media sources are typically motivated by a passion for the \"truth\" and providing a voice for the otherwise voiceless. It is therefore questionable to state that entertainment over truth is prioritised in New Media.\n\nIn conclusion, while it may be the case that mainstream media and para-journalism have been known to prioritise entertainment over the truth, it is somewhat short-sighted to paint all media with the same brush. New media, in particular, has revolutionized the way news is presented to the public and brought increased scrutiny to mainstream media's coverage of issues. Rather than focusing on entertainment, it appears that media sources of all types have created a hierarchical structure of news \"worthiness\" depending on their target audience's desires, and this has inevitably led to media sources sacrificing journalistic values for profit and attention.",
                "ut possible war crimes committed by ISIS in Iraq and Syria. The emphasis is squarely on the \"show\", not on the substance of the case. It is no secret that para-journalism seeks to attract people through novelty and the use of emotional hooks-whether through heartwarming tales of thwarted danger or stories that are designed to shock and horrify readers. The reality of life is glossed over to make way for a neat and superficial narrative that appeals to the masses. Consequently, para-journalism does not prioritize truth in the traditional sense; it prioritizes sales and the attention of its audience instead.\nNew Media, which refers to a newer form of social media that relies on the internet and technology to disseminate news, faces unique challenges in producing content that prioritizes the truth while still appealing to its audience. Social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, have become a dominant source of news for a significant proportion of the population, especially the younger generation. With a population that is accustomed to instant gratification and quick bites of information, it is increasingly tough to attract them with news stories that concern public interests. Rather than entertainment, New Media prioritizes information and virality. They rely on algorithms to personalise content that readers are likely to read, enjoy and share. Consequently, issues concerning public interests such as climate change and political happenings are often presented in a simplified and populist manner to draw in readers. However, it is worth acknowledging that New Media has brought about a democratization of the news: anyone with an internet connection and some rudimentary writing abilities can now comment on the events of the day, and produce journalistic content that is not filtered by mainstream media gatekeepers. It is therefore not entirely accurate to say that New Media prioritizes entertainment or even information; what it prioritizes is accessibility, and matching the demands of its target audience.\n\nIn conclusion, the priorities of media today are complex and multi-layered. While the temptation to reduce media to one overarching priority is ever present, the diversity of media sources precludes such an exercise. Broadly speaking, mainstream media tends to prioritize agenda-setting, para-journalism prioritizes entertainment and New Media prioritizes accessibility. Nonetheless, within each category, there are nuanced differences in the way news is presented. Hence, we must exercise caution when making sweeping generalisations about priorities of media, lest we fall into the trap of confirmation bias.",
                "ut the Rohingya crisis at the United Nations in 2017. This is an example of how para-journalism sources care little about the truth and more about providing entertainment to their target audience. That said, it is important to note that para-journalism sources cater to a specific audience who desires a different kind of content as compared to mainstream media. It can be argued that as long as the audience is interested in such content, there will always be a market for it.\nFinally, New Media refers to journalism that sources from the internet and social media platforms. It is my opinion that New Media prioritises views and clicks more than entertainment or truth. In order to generate income, New Media sources such as BuzzFeed and online news sites like The Independent, rely heavily on providing sensationalised news to its viewers. While this is considered a less superior form of journalism as compared to mainstream media, it is also important to acknowledge that New Media provides a platform for alternative voices to be heard. Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook provide a space for citizen journalists and grassroots voices to share their opinions and provide a different perspective on issues that matter to them. This underscores the significant role that New Media plays in shaping public opinion, bringing to the forefront the voices of the marginalised and hitherto unheard.\nIn conclusion, the claim that entertainment is the priority of the media today is too broad and unjustifiably over-generalised. The media is a heterogeneous entity that caters to different forms of content in order to appeal to different target audiences. While it is true that the media does at times prioritise entertainment over the truth, this is largely a result of their profit-generating agenda or to cater to the viewing desires of their audience. However, this does not necessarily mean that entertainment always overrides the truth in today's media landscape.",
                "ut the Rohingya crisis in Myanmar. Such reports suggest that para-journalism news sources are more interested in the sensational and the easy-to-digest than in the need to remain factual and informative. It cannot be denied that para-journalism remains a fixture of not just social media but individual blogs and even television networks; evident in the widespread notion that \"if it bleeds, it leads\", providing quick and easy content that can attract attention. However, this may not entirely be a reflection of para-journalism's desires. Para-journalism works on a shoestring budget and writers/editors obviously require money to survive. Paid content on digital platforms isn't guaranteed anymore, so clicks and likes carry a very real monetary value for them. Thus the need to keep their readers interested and entertained to keep themselves within their reader's attention span, and hence their income. It is debatable whether the nature of para-journalism is to entertain at the expense of truth, but the balance is struck during each news piece that is churned out.\nFinally, with the rise of new media, which encompasses self-publication as well as citizen journalism, entertainment has continued to take up more time and space. Certainly, social media platforms has enabled the proliferation of fake news and unreliable sources, and the appeal of engaging content incentivises cutting corners and spreading falsehoods. However, the tendency to prioritise entertainment can also be interpreted as a symptom of a more inclusive and interconnected media landscape. New media is largely dependent on \"shares\" to gain a wider reach, and so entertainment and sensationalism can be utilised to attract this added attention. However, due to the near-infinite number of sources available online, new media is paradoxically more committed to truth than ever before. Since reputations, clicks and ratings remain a major reason for why people bother to engage with particular sources of media, new media sources have a greater incentive than before to be reliable and fact-based in their reporting. The rise of fact-checking websites underscores this point; regardless of whether entertainment or public truth remains the priority, it is difficult to voice an opinion without a commitment to verifiable facts.\nIn conclusion, whether or not the priority of media today is entertainment over truth is debatable. Certainly certain forms of media may overtly prioritise the goals or norms of their consumer more than others, such as para-journalism or mainstream media. However, it is unrealistic to render this into simple dichotomies without understanding the underlying circumstances and contexts of each media form. Entertainment and truth are not mutually incompatible, as entertainment can also be a means of engaging and informing viewers about current events, and journalism can be a form of entertainment. At the end of the day, media remains a powerful engine through which people can be educated, informed and entertained, and so understanding its complexities is crucial to making informed choices about what and how we consume media.",
                "ut ISIS rape and genocide allegations. This trivialises the seriousness of the situation, and prioritises entertainment over truth.\nFinally, New Media sources like social media websites have today taken the world by storm. This has led to a shift in what is considered news and what isn't. These sources prioritise virality over everything. It is often said that \"if it does not go viral, it's not news\". This highlights the fact that in New Media, entertainment takes precedence over the truth, as the focus is on sensationalism. The proliferation of fake news, clickbait headlines, and memes is evidence of this. Social media users are known to recycle news stories, often without checking for the truthfulness of the story, just so they can attract attention to their posts. This is indicative of how the media is willing to prioritise entertainment rather than truth to generate attention.\nIn conclusion, therefore, it cannot be said that entertainment is the sole priority of the media today. While entertainment is certainly important to the media, and some forms of media may indeed prioritise entertainment over truth, this does not apply to all forms, or even all incidents, of media. Mainstream media outlets often resort to sensationalist reporting to generate clicks and likes, but this is sometimes an effort to sustain their advertisement revenue as opposed to pleasing their readership. Conversely, para-journalism seems to have little interest in public affairs and prioritises entertaining the public over the truth. Finally, New Media prioritises virality over everything, leading to extreme sensationalism in news reporting. Ultimately, the nature of the media today is complex and cannot be reduced to a simple dichotomy between entertainment and truth.",
                "ut human rights abuses in the Maldives, rather than the actual substance of her case. Articles under para-journalism make no attempts at espousing any truth, but rather only seek to entertain the public and maintain a high viewership to drive up the advertisement revenue. This is because para-journalism articles have never been known for quality journalism, but instead, offer entertainment in the form of scandalous material.\nLastly, New Media, which refers to online sources of information, has changed the way people consume news, and there are new implications for the way media companies prioritize entertainment or truth. New Media seeks to bring together people of similar interests and moods, who together seek out desired messages and meanings in a world of increasingly ceaseless information. New Media offers an unprecedented level of accessibility to people from all over the world, who can share information and news with the click of a button. However, these platforms offer equal access to the truth and falsehoods - that which entertains alongside that which informs. The anonymity of the internet allows various forms of entertainment to be peddled as the truth, this can lead to a great deal of confusion about the true nature of an event. New media sources like illustratedtravel.com offer a wide array of content that blends news and entertainment, making it hard to distinguish between priority given to entertainment or truth.\nIn conclusion, the notion that entertainment trumps truth as the priority of media companies today is an oversimplification. It is reasonable to argue that while the media has become dramatically more superficial with the rise of celebrity culture and with the advent of new media, the need for quality journalism has never been more important. Mainstream media, para-journalism and New Media each have their own agendas that dictate their priorities. Mainstream media's priority may not be skewed towards entertainment as much as popular opinion believes. Para-journalism is notorious for preferring entertainment to truth and New Media's accessibility means truth and entertainment are easily confused.  Ultimately, it is the job of the public to be discerning and critical consumers of the media, and to be adept at identifying what is true and what has been sensationalized for entertainment purposes.",

Little emphasis was given to the significance of the court hearing itself, and it is unlikely that this coverage added any value to public awareness of global affairs. Para-journalism, therefore, appears to prioritize entertainment at the expense of truth and public interest.\nFinally, with the rise of New Media such as social media, blogs, and online news sources, it is clear that the priorities of the media have changed dramatically. Many New Media sources have explicitly stated that they do not focus on truth, but on \"clicks\" and \"going viral\" as a means of generating revenue. As such, it can be assumed that New Media sources do generally prioritize entertaining or attention-grabbing content over truth or public interest. The widespread dissemination of \"fake news\" and \"clickbait\" articles are stark examples of the negative effects of New Media's prioritization of entertainment.\nIn conclusion, while it is a popular sentiment that entertainment has become the priority of the media today, this is only partially true. The motives and priorities of different forms of media are complex and dependent on their profit generation and target audience. While para-journalism and New Media do generally prioritize entertainment, mainstream media at times still prioritizes truth despite its tendency towards sensationalism. It is important that readers approach all forms of media with critical thinking and vigilance, in order to distinguish between entertaining content and that which serves the public interest.",
                "ut the Rohingya crisis. The focus on trivial details that have no bearing on the story at hand is a prime example of how para-journalism seems to prioritise entertainment over truth. The preoccupation with the emotional pull of a story and aesthetic appeal of its subject matter over the substance of its contents appears to be the modus operandi of para-journalism. It is not difficult to reason that this inclination stems from their dependency on circulation and subscription sales, which is determined by the popularity and newsworthiness of their stories.\nFinally, the advent of New Media, which concerns forms of media that are produced in a digital format and disseminated online, has greatly expanded the spectrum of priority differences in media. New Media has given rise to an unprecedented and diverse range of media sources, ranging from social media platforms, to personal blogs, to independent online news sources. Within these sources, the motivations can range widely, from seeking to inform, entertain, or mobilise support for political ends. This extreme variability illustrates that the purpose of media is not simply binary but lies instead on a spectrum.\nIn sum, the idea that entertainment has replaced truth as the priority of the media is a crude reductionist oversimplification of the complicated dynamics affecting different generations and kinds of media. While elements of the media do place premium on pablum, the motivations of media sources are diverse and layered, ranging from revenue generation to journalistic standards, to creating news that resonate with the public. Ultimately, whether it\u2019s entertainment or truth, the effects of media are part of a complex, multifaceted network of information and influence that inform, educate, entertain or mislead the public."

            "prompt": "\"THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF RELIGION DID NOT EXIST.\" WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "e earlier argument that religion promotes division and gives rise to a \"us versus them\" mentality needs to be balanced by the fact that religion plays an important role in our world today as a unifying force, creating to hold people together in communities where individuals feel safe, accepted and respected. Organized religions foster a deep sense of community among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people who hold similar values. Religious festivals such as Thaipusam, Hannukah, Easter and Hari Raya witness people coming together in a show of solidarity and community bonding. As a consequence, religion does provide a measure of civil order by nurturing a sense of belonging among people, which is far more desirable in preventing violence and conflict than societies with no central guiding principles save that of materialism and self-centredness. Indeed, many religions advocate practices that place helpful limitations on the behaviour of their adherents. Teachings such as the Ten Commandments in the Torah and the Bible, and the Middle Path in Buddhism, reject extremism and embrace moderation, leading many to view them as positive influences which potentially protect adherents from the destructive or even fatal excesses to which they might otherwise be susceptible. Many, if not all, religions promote peace, and the unfortunate fact that conflicts take place in the name of religion is more a reflection of how a minority of believers have misconstrued and distorted certain doctrines in their religions either out of misguided teachings or to serve their own narrow and selfish agendas. This is therefore an indication of our innate human nature rather than an indictment of religion as an institution in society. Hence, religion can and does serve a useful purpose in modern society in this aspect.\nIn addition to the role that religion plays in the areas of community identity and moral guidance, religion also has a cherished place in society because of the positive impacts which are manifested in practical and concrete ways. By championing the universality of humanity as a race with shared values, dignity and respect, religion often brings out the \"human\" side of mankind in the areas of charity, compassion and altruism for the betterment of humankind. The  2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami witnessed international aid coming from non-Muslim organizations like the Salvation Army in the well-intentioned provision of humanitarian aid; Christianity is noted for the founding of many missionary orphanages and schools; Buddhist welfare organizations are often at the helm providing food and medical supplies to the needy. In fact, the most well-known international humanitarian organizations \u2013 the Red Cross and the Red Crescent \u2013 were initially established as religious outfits to provide humanitarian aid and comfort in a suffering world. Offshoots of organized religion, such as A Rocha'sEcochurches in the United Kingdom, also lead efforts to promote conservation of the natural environment. Formal research also suggests that religion can be a force for good as it promotes a sense of engagement with the community. Research conducted by the Religious News Service suggest that religious people are three to four times more likely to engage in civic activism, be it volunteering with grassroots organisations or donating money to a selected social cause. In today'sworld which places great emphasis on profit-making, personal and corporate goals, selfish materialism, it can be argued that religion is more needed than ever to teach us to think and act beyond the narrow confines of our own comfortable worlds.\nBesides the positive functions of religion at the societal level, religion also meets many needs for the individual. Although much has been made about how religious faith is at odds with rational analysis, many famous thinkers and intellectuals actually found their way to God through the path of cognitive evaluation and rational analysis. Prominent figures such as C.S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, and Antony Flew have written extensively on how the teachings of religion most closely describe the realities of the world we live in, with both Lewis and Flew being staunch advocates of atheism before converting to Christianity after weighing the historical and intellectual evidence for the existence of God. Beyond cognitive reasoning, religion also taps into the emotional wellspring of our existence by providing deeply-satisfying emotional experiences. From the singing of traditional hymns to the practice of solitary meditation; from the trance-like states produced in such practices as the Whirling Dervishes to the graceful motions of yoga; believers of religion are able to find emotional relief and fulfilment by participating in such rituals and acts. But it is at the spiritual level that religion most attend to the needs of people. Through postulating a reality which includes both the natural and the supernatural, both the seen and the unseen; both the temporal and the eternal, religion helps man in his search for meaning and answers to life'sfundamental questions that science, technology and materialism have not been able to provide adequate answers. Why do we suffer? Why are we here? What happens after death? Such issues as the human condition, the purpose of human existence on earth, the afterlife, can only be answered by religion and faith in God that transcends our finite, material and physical existence,  providing hope in an eternal life. But even in this life, religion also fills a spiritual gap that gives believers strength and resilience in the difficult times. Abraham Maslow'sresearch after World War Two revealed that Holocaust survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs, suggesting it helped people cope in extreme circumstances. This was most famously enunciated in Viktor Frankel'smoving book entitled \"Man'sSearch for Meaning\", detailing his experience with the importance of religion in his survival of the concentration camps of the Holocaust. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, what shone through was that instead of renouncing religion bitterly, many turned to God for solace and comfort. As can be seen, in today'sworld wrought with conflict, disasters, and uncertainties, religion has not declined in relevance, but instead increased as it becomes embraced as a coping mechanism for people in their grief and despair.\nFinally, in our current frantic pace of life, religion provides an avenue for the fatigued and the frustrated. As a result of technology and globalization, a whole slew of health-related problems have emerged in modern society, with depression, stress and burnout being just a few of them. Many stressed-out individuals have been known to take time off from their hectic work schedules to be alone for reflection and contemplation, often turning to religion for respite. In Singapore, retreat centres such as the Catholic Spirituality Centre and the Maranatha Retreat are becoming increasingly popular among working adults who seek havens to rest, recharge and restore their personal ecologies in a world away from the everyday busy routine of life'sdemands and stresses. Catholic churches, Buddhist temples, Hindu temples are also witnessing more people entering their sacred sanctuaries during lunchtime on a workday or after work to pray and seek rest and comfort. Thus, religion can be said to provide a much needed stabilizing and calming effect in our society that is fast being deprived of assurance, direction and security.\nIn a world where the winds of globalization are blowing strong and the domination of science is growing deep, we desperately need religion as an anchor to provide a sense of identity and community and as a compass to guide us and offer navigation in the uncharted waters of new scientific discoveries. Granted, religion has been used to justify much tension, violence and human suffering but we do need to also acknowledge the many positive benefits it has brought to mankind both at the societal and individual levels. Getting rid of religion would not only fail to solve many of our current problems, but would remove a much-needed institution in a world increasingly fraught with fear and insecurity and marked by a culture of excess.",

In the Middle East, for example, Islam serves as the glue that holds communities together, irrespective of their political affiliations or economic status. Similarly, in India, Hinduism has been the foundation of cultural practices that transcend social divides, such as the caste system. Without religion, societies would be more fragmented and less cohesive.\n\nHowever, critics of religion argue that it has been the source of much violence and conflict around the world. Religion has been used to justify wars, genocide, and persecution. The Crusades, the Spanish Inquisition, and the partition of India and Pakistan are just a few examples of the violent confrontations that have been fueled by religion. Furthermore, religious fundamentalism has been blamed for many terrorism incidents, such as the 9/11 attacks by Islamic extremists. All these incidents have tarnished the image of religion and led to much strife and human suffering.\n\nHowever, the root cause of such conflicts is not religion per se but rather the misinterpretation of religious teachings by fanatics. Religion itself espouses peace, compassion, and respect for one another, and it is the extremist\u2019s interpretation that creates violence. Furthermore, while many religions have been implicated in violent acts, it is important to recognize that religion is not the only source of conflict. Ideological, political, and economic differences have also been the source of many conflicts around the world.\n\nIn conclusion, it is my belief that the world would not be a better place without religion. Religion provides a spiritual dimension to people's lives, inspires humanitarian initiatives, and fosters social cohesion. While it is true that religion has been the source of conflict and violence, this is not a problem inherent to religion as an institution, but rather a consequence of extremists' misinterpretation of religious teachings.

Religious organisations often run schools, hospitals, orphanages and homeless shelters, providing services and support to those in need. They also foster a sense of community and belonging among members of the same faith, which is important in establishing a shared identity and sense of purpose. Religious festivals and gatherings provide a platform for people to interact with each other and to celebrate their shared values and beliefs.

It's also instructive that a lot of adherents to religion have found in it a source of comfort, strength and hope during times of personal crises and adversity. Religion provides many with a sense of purpose and meaning in life, and this helps to keep them on the straight and narrow. Religion is a means of keeping people grounded in life and makes them aware of their responsibilities as human beings. It provides a sense of continuity and tradition, a sense that we are part of something larger, and that we are not alone.\nIn conclusion, while it's true that religion has been blamed for many of the world's problems, it would be a mistake to conclude that the world would be a better place without it. Religion has played an important role in shaping human civilisation and has been an integral part of many cultures throughout history. Simply sweeping it away would be a naive and simplistic solution to the complex problems we face today. Instead, we should continue to acknowledge the positive contributions of religion to society, while also working towards removing the negative aspects of it. It's important that we find a way to balance the benefits of religion with the need for tolerance, understanding, and mutual respect. Only then can we create a world that is truly peaceful and harmonious for everyone.",
                "e role of religion has been equally essential. In addition to providing moral guidelines to individuals that inform their values and attitudes, religion has acted as a cohesive force in societies. Communities often come together to celebrate religious festivals or events that act as social glue, forging relationships and creating shared experiences that strengthen communal bonds. Religious institutions and organizations have often been at the forefront of efforts to alleviate poverty, provide education and healthcare, assist in disaster relief, and promote human rights. It is a testament to the power of religion that some of the most iconic figures of the 20th century, such as Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King Jr., and Mother Teresa, were all deeply religious and motivated by its tenets to bring about change. Because religion often inspires individuals to selflessness, sacrifice, compassion, and generosity, it can be argued that society would be much poorer without religious institutions and their contributions to public welfare.\nIn conclusion, while religion has been the source of much conflict and tension in the world, and many believe that it has no place in the modern, secular, and scientific world, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion does not stand up to scrutiny. Religion still plays a crucial role in our world, providing moral guidance, communal bonds, and social welfare, among other things. In light of the moral, ethical, and societal challenges that we face today, we should recognize the continuing relevance of religion, and work towards using it as a source of inspiration and guidance for a better future.",
                "ere are also significant contributions made by religion in terms of social cohesion, charity work and philanthropy. Religion has always played a role in fostering social cohesion by bringing people together under a common faith and belief system. It has often been the foundation of communities - think of how churches and temples serve not just as places of worship but also as community centres where people come together to celebrate festivals, build relationships and promote kinship ties. In terms of charity work, religions are often at the forefront of efforts to alleviate poverty, hunger and suffering. Think of how Christian missionaries work overseas in developing countries to provide education, medical aid and shelter for the poor; or how Buddhist monks organize charity events to feed the hungry and care for the sick. The concept of \"tithing\" - donating a portion of one's income to the church or temple - remains a common practice in many religions and has helped to support the running of religious institutions that provide welfare services. Moreover, religion has also served as a catalyst for interfaith dialogue, bringing together people of different faiths to foster mutual understanding and respect. In a world that is often divided by ethnic and religious fault lines, this is an invaluable contribution made by religion that should not be easily dismissed.\nIn conclusion, while it cannot be denied that religion has at times been the source of tension and conflict, it would be too simplistic to argue that the world would be a better place without religion. In fact, religion has played a vital role in human history, providing comfort, guidance and moral direction to individuals and societies alike. It is true that religion needs to adapt to the changing times and accommodate scientific progress, but we should not forget the positive benefits that it has brought to our world. Ultimately, it is up to us to determine how we use religion - as a force for good or for bad - and how we ensure that it continues to play a constructive role in shaping our world.",
                "e role of religion should also not be undervalued. It is noteworthy to recognize the enormous contribution that religious organizations have made to uplift and support the less fortunate members of society. Many religious groups have been at the forefront of building schools, hospitals and care centers in some of the most impoverished and disadvantaged regions of the world, providing much-needed aid and support to those in need. Additionally, religious organizations have also promoted social cohesion, peace and harmony in a world that is marked by growing animosity between communities and cultures. Religious groups have often been instrumental in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding, creating bridges between peoples of different faiths and cultures. For instance, the Interfaith Council of Singapore promotes greater inter-religious and racial understanding, urging members of various faiths to appreciate the beliefs and practices of others and promoting goodwill and harmony in society. Such initiatives create and build tolerant societies, which can serve as a bulwark against the hate-filled rhetoric of extremists on all sides. Hence, the role of religion should not be dismissed as it has a huge role to play in nurturing and building societies that are more compassionate, equitable and peaceful.\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly negative aspects associated with religion, it would be naive and simplistic to contend that the world would be a better place without it altogether. Religion is a powerful force with the potential to bring about profound changes in people's lives and in society as a whole. It offers a guiding framework that provides us with moral direction and solace in a world that is increasingly complex and unpredictable. Categorizing religion as either wholly good or wholly bad is problematic because the role of religion in society is nuanced and complex. It is therefore essential that we continue to engage with religion critically, challenging its excesses and negative tendencies while recognizing the immense contributions it has made to our world. By doing so, we can harness the power of religion to create a world that is truly fair, just and compassionate for all.",
                "e role that religion has played cannot be ignored either. Religion has had a positive impact on the social fabric of society by providing a sense of community, fostering goodwill and solidarity among its adherents. Religious organizations and institutions have also been at the forefront of charitable work, contributing to society in meaningful ways such as caring for the sick, elderly and disadvantaged. In many parts of the world, people are drawn together by shared traditions, rituals and beliefs, which offer a sense of belonging and identity. This is especially true in countries where religion serves as a source of comfort and hope in situations of oppression or poverty. It is therefore difficult to negate the contribution that religion has made to society in fostering social harmony and integration.\nIn conclusion, it is clear that the claim that the world would be a better place if religion did not exist is a gross oversimplification. While it is undeniable that religion has been at times the source of conflict and tension, it also serves many positive functions that have benefited mankind throughout our history. In fact, religion has played an integral role in shaping moral values, beliefs, culture and societal structures that form the very foundation of our world today. Rather than dismissing religion wholesale, perhaps we should explore how religion can be adapted to meet the needs of a changing world while preserving the positive values and contributions it has made throughout history.",
                "e role of religion in promoting social cohesion and community is undeniable. Religion often provides a common identity, a shared history, and a shared set of beliefs that bond people together. Religious organizations often undertake charitable works, providing aid to the poor and needy. Moreover, religion provides a sense of comfort and hope to people in times of distress, such as in times of war or natural disaster. It gives meaning and purpose to people's lives, providing them with a sense of existential security that transcends the vicissitudes of life. In this sense, religious institutions often act as a buffer to the ravages of modern life, providing a stable foundation for personal and social well-being. In the absence of religion, it is possible that people may feel adrift, lacking a sense of identity and purpose, and be more susceptible to falling into social isolation, depression and existential crisis.\nFinally, the argument that religion has no place in politics also overlooks the valuable role that religion has played in the liberation movements of the past. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. famously invoked the Christian faith as a moral framework to promote civil rights and equality. Mahatma Gandhi relied on the teachings of Hinduism to promote the non-violent struggle against British colonialism in India. Religion has also played a key role in the fight against apartheid in South Africa and in the struggle of Polish workers against communist rule. In all these cases, religion acted as a unifying force to galvanize people to oppose oppression, and provide a clear moral vision of what a just and equitable society should look like. Without religion, it is possible that these movements may not have been as successful or as transformative as they were.\nIn conclusion, the view that the world would be a better place if religion did not exist is a simplistic and reductionist claim that overlooks the many positive benefits and contributions that religion has made to our societies. While it is true that religion in its various forms has been a source of conflict and discord, it has also provided a moral framework, a sense of community, and a bulwark against the excesses of modern life. It has served as a unifying force in liberating people from oppression and promoting social justice. We should not dismiss religion out of hand but rather engage in constructive dialogue to critically evaluate it and seek to promote its positive aspects while minimizing its negative effects.",
                "e benefits of religion are also evident. Religion often provides the glue that bind communities together, creating a sense of shared identity and purpose that transcends individual differences. This is seen in the many religious festivals and communal events which dot the calendar year - Christmas, Diwali, Eid-al-Fitr and Wesak Day - which bring disparate groups of people together in a show of communal solidarity. Religion can also be a vital source of charity work and social activism: the Catholic Church, for example, has been instrumental in caring for the sick and the needy in communities around the world, while the Buddhist Tzu Chi Foundation has been credited with undertaking disaster relief efforts in the wake of natural calamities all over the world. These acts of charity and selflessness are important in fostering social cohesion and have the power to bring people together in ways that transcend political allegiances or national borders.\nMoreover, religion can be a source of positive personal growth and development. For many people, religion provides a framework for personal reflection, encourages personal growth, and offers guidance for living a meaningful and fulfilled life. Religion can increase a sense of purpose and meaning in one's life, providing individuals with a sense of direction and a sense of belonging. This is perhaps why religion continues to be an important aspect of millions of people's lives around the world, even in the face of the rapid secularization of many societies.\nTo conclude, while there is little doubt that religion has been implicated in many instances of conflict, violence and oppression, the claim that the world would be a better place if religion did not exist is too absolute. The truth is that religion has played and continues to play a vital role in shaping our world, both for good and for ill. While we should be vigilant against the negative aspects of religion, we cannot overlook the many benefits that religion provides, both to individuals and to society as a whole. In the end, the debate around whether the world would be a better place without religion is something we must reflect on ourselves and decide for ourselves.",
                "e role of religion should also not be underestimated. Religion can provide a cohesive force that brings people of different races, cultures and backgrounds together. Take the example of India, where the policy of secularism has been used to keep the various religious and ethnic groups together, despite the country's tremendous diversity. Religion can also inculcate respect for authority and law.  Religious institutions such as the Catholic Church and the Anglican Church have long played a vital role in providing social services and caring for the poor, sick and disadvantaged in local communities. Many religious organizations are also involved in charitable work, disaster relief and the provision of education for less fortunate people around the world.\nIn addition, religion can play a crucial role in providing comfort and hope in times of crisis. People often find solace in their faith when they are faced with illness, grief, or other forms of adversity. In his book, \"The Varieties of Religious Experience,\" William James argued that religious experiences, such as feelings of overwhelming love and benevolence, can give people a sense of purpose and meaning in life that they may not find elsewhere. This is reflected in the many people who turn to their faith during times of war, terrorism, or natural calamities. Religion can help people cope with extreme stress and anxiety when other conventional means of assistance may not be available.\nIn conclusion, while the excesses of religion have at times caused divisions, strife and conflict both within and between nations, it is my view that this does not warrant the dismissal of religion as a whole. The world would be a poorer place without religion, for religion serves to provide a moral framework in which to strive for personal and social well-being, and offers comfort, support and hope to millions of people around the world. The challenge, therefore, is to work towards a world where religion is viewed as a positive force for good, and where the teachings of all religions are used to promote peace and harmony among all peoples.",
                "e benefits of religion are manifold. Religious communities often play a significant role in providing social welfare services to the needy and marginalized members of society, from soup kitchens to drug rehabilitation centers, and from education to medical care. Furthermore, religion is often the means by which people find a sense of belonging, comfort, and hope- a community where they can share experiences, find emotional support, and develop meaningful relationships. The institution of religion can act as a unifying force to bring people together across different backgrounds, promoting peace, tolerance and understanding. This is exemplified by the role played by religious leaders during times of crisis, such as the interfaith vigils held in the aftermath of the Christchurch mosque shootings in New Zealand. Above all, religion can provide a framework for understanding and making sense of the world, and give people a sense of purpose and direction.\nIn conclusion, while it is understandable why some may view religion as a source of discord and tension in the world, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion is too simplistic and fails to acknowledge the many positive benefits religion brings to humanity. Far from being incompatible with modernity and reason, religion continues to play an important role in promoting morality, compassion, and community, and in providing meaning and comfort in uncertain times. In a world that is increasingly fractured and divided, we need the unifying force that religion can provide more than ever before.",
                "e function of religion is equally important. Religion has contributed greatly to the building of communities, charities, and social welfare organizations. The Catholic Church alone operates one of the world's largest networks of charities, hospitals, and aid organizations, providing support to millions of people around the world. Other religious groups such as the Salvation Army, Islamic Relief, and the Jewish Relief Agency also play a significant role in the provision of aid, relief, and support to the needy. By promoting charity and helping the poor and marginalized, religion serves as a counterweight to the excesses of capitalism and the pursuit of wealth at the expense of others. In areas plagued by conflict, religious leaders have been the front aid workers during disasters and in conflict situations, and have helped to restore communities and bring warring factions to peaceful resolution. In this sense, religion is an important factor in social cohesion and in helping to create a more just and equitable society.\nIn summary, while religion has been the cause of much division and strife in the world, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion is an overstatement. Religion has provided moral guidance and comfort to countless people throughout history, and remains one of the key institutions which provide moral clarity in a world that is increasingly beset by moral confusion. The concept of religion is often seen as incompatible with modernity, but this essay has shown how religion still has a vital role to play in society as a moral compass, providing communities with a sense of purpose, and playing a crucial role in providing aid and relief to the less fortunate. While religion must be kept in check to prevent it from being abused, it is undoubtedly an essential component of our world and has contributed much to the development and preservation of human society."

            "human_gen_truncate": "Liberia observed that recidivism rates for former mercenaries decreased when they were offered employment opportunities and resources Indeed, because economic gains often translate into less poverty and less desperation which then leads to greater social security, it can be argued that achieving economic gains should be a top priority for the government.\nHowever, despite the fact that economic gains do bring about a higher standard of living, more effective political governance and greater social stability, there is also a need to recognise that rapid economic growth can, and does, also generate certain negative side-effects that governments do well to take note of. Critics, for instance, highlight the fact that although Singapore has an impressive economic growth track record, it also has one of the world'shighest Gini coefficients, which is a figure that measures the income inequity levels of countries. The income disparity in Singapore is further accentuated by statistics which reveal that the bottom 10% of Singaporean households earn $570 a month, while the top 10% of Singaporeans earn $13,581 a month. Yet, while it is true that this wide gulf is partly caused by the Singapore government'sbreakneck pursuit of economic gains, it must also be noted that the government does recognize this issue and has channelled much of Singapore'sfinancial gains from past decades back to helping the needy and disadvantaged in recent years. A good example of this is how in the economic recession of 2008-2009, the Singapore government was able to dip into its reserves to draw S$4.9 billion to fund two extraordinary measures such as the Jobs Credit and a Special Risk-Sharing Initiative to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn.  Singapore'sBudgets of the last few years also have also kept the social needs and welfare of the people. The budget allocated to ministries such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth has increased by 100%, from $15 billion in 2009 to $30 billion in 2018. New schemes such as Careshield Life have been steadily introduced as their primary focus the social needs and welfare of the people, with billions of dollars being harnessed to fund community initiatives such as ComCare to help to address the diverse needs of Singapore the needy. In light of this, it can be argued that economic gains actually do lead indirectly to social stability as the monies generated provide the means to look after areas of society that the government is obliged to look into. Therefore, economic gains should be the main concern of the government, even as it acts to ensure that those who may not be benefiting from the economic gains are given the help and assistance that they require.\nOn another note, detractors of the position that economic gains should be the primary concern of the government opine that, more often than not, these economic gains come at the expense of the environment. When governments make industrialisation and modernisation a top priority, environmental concerns and conservation inevitably almost always become marginalised. A prime example of this would be India, which has enjoyed a GDP growth rate of 6 to 7% since 1991. Yet, although it has one of the world'shighest rates of economic growth, India is also notorious for the vast environmental damage that economic development has wrought within the country. As of 2019, 22 of the world's320 most polluted cities are found in India; and life expectancy has decreased by 2.6 years due to air pollution. The Ganges river is one of the most polluted in the world, and close to 640 000 die every year due to water pollution. Similarly, 40% of China'slakes and water sources are contaminated with chemicals from factories; numerous species of wildlife have become extinct, most notable among them being the Yangtze River Dolphin. But thankfully, in contrast, the situation in Singapore is more optimistic. While it cannot be denied that economic progress at times come at the cost of the environment, the Singapore government has assiduously worked hard to balance this tension between pursuing economic gains and pursuing environmental protection by using the financial gains it has amassed through sound economic policies to map out and implement strategies to ensure sustainable living within the country. For instance, since 2012, the Housing Development Board has rolled out a $31 million drive to install solar panels in 30 neighbourhoods, and it is currently in the process of turning its youngest townships such as Punggol, Bidadari and Tengah into real-time test beds for the newest energy-saving innovations. The Solar Energy Institute of Singapore is leading the research and development in the solar energy sector, with the support of the Economic Development Board and the National Research Foundation of Singapore, among others. Many of these initiatives to protect the environment can only come about because of the economic gains that the Singapore government has achieved for the country which then pave the way for these projects to be adopted.\nIn the final analysis, while we acknowledge that the government has a duty to look into legitimate concerns that economic gains can lead to undesirable consequences, it must also be recognized that governments must first and foremost ensure the economic viability of the countries they lead.  This is for the simple reason that without economic security being achieved in the first place, essential services cannot be provided. A strong argument can therefore be made for economic gains to be the main concern of the government, as this gives it the financial and political means to implement policies which address other aspects of society such as income inequity and environmental conservation, as the case of Singapore has adequately shown.",

These policies not only benefit the environment but also improve the quality of life for our citizens.\n\nFinally, cultural preservation is an important aspect of a government's responsibility to ensure the well-being of its citizens.

Instead, governments should take a more holistic approach to policy-making, addressing the needs of all citizens and balancing economic gains with broader societal concerns.

This highlights the important point that while economic growth must be a key concern, it needs to be pursued in a socially and environmentally responsible way, with long-term thinking.\n\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that economic gains should be the primary concern of government policies, as this is the bedrock for ensuring the physical, social, and political well-being of its citizens. However, the attainment of economic growth must not be pursued at the expense of other concerns such as income inequity and environmental degradation. With long-term thinking, sensible policies, and socially responsible practices, governments can ensure that economic progress is achieved hand-in-hand with social and environmental sustainability.",
                "Sierra Leone and Liberia found that economic security, via vocational training, microfinance and business start-up support, had a transformative impact on the lives of ex-combatants, reducing crime rates and promoting stability in these two post-conflict countries.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that the pursuit of economic growth is not without its flaws, the most common of which is income inequality. The reality is that as economies grow, the distribution of wealth becomes more uneven. This issue has been recognised by the Singapore government with the creation of progressive policies such as the Workfare Income Supplement scheme, MediSave and the Silver Support Scheme, all of which complement the Central Provident Fund. Even so, critics have argued that these policies do not adequately level the playing field, with some citizens still struggling to make ends meet. The negative externalities of economic growth - such as environmental degradation - must also be taken into account. Singapore's government has been actively weighing environmental concerns against economic gain, with such initiatives as the Sustainable Singapore Blueprint and the implementation of carbon pricing. Nevertheless, it is important to recognise the trade-offs that come with the prioritisation of economic growth; such measures may limit growth and progress in other areas, such as social and environmental sustainability.\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of economic gains has its drawbacks, it remains the primary concern of government policies for the simple reason that, without a thriving economy, other societal objectives cannot be achieved. In Singapore, the success of the government's policies in promoting economic growth and prosperity has resulted in social and political stability, and has enabled it to pursue other objectives such as improving education, strengthening healthcare and promoting environmental sustainability. In other words, while keeping the adage that a civilised society should care for its weakest members, it is essential to acknowledge that economic gains are the bedrock of a robust and effective government that is able to enhance the overall quality of life of its citizens.",
                "Jaffna, Sri Lanka, found that the programme was successful in reducing crime rates in the conflict-ridden region by providing former combatants with employment opportunities, thereby easing their economic woes and curbing their incentives to resort to crime to earn a livelihood.\nFurthermore, it is important to note that a government that does not pay sufficient attention to economic growth and the resultant benefits of a healthy economy risks losing the trust and confidence of its people. In countries where the economy is stagnant or declining, people become disillusioned with the government and feel that it is failing to provide them with the basic necessities of life. This can further exacerbate social and political tensions, which can then become the breeding ground for discontent and potentially violent conflicts. In Singapore, the government has consistently shown that it is proactive in taking action to promote economic growth, which has helped to maintain the trust and confidence of its citizens. It has created many policies such as SkillsFuture, Productivity and Innovation Credit, to ensure that Singaporeans are equipped with the necessary skills to meet the demands of the future economy. Similarly, in China, the government has launched a series of reforms aimed at reducing inequality, improving access to education and healthcare, and easing the widespread poverty that still exists in many parts of the country. These efforts have helped to ensure that the Chinese people remain supportive of their government and optimistic about the future.\nIn conclusion, while it is crucial for governments to be mindful of the potential negative consequences that may arise from an overemphasis on economic growth, the fact remains that economic gains should be the primary concern of government policies. A healthy and growing economy is vital to ensure the material well-being of the people, maintain political stability, ensure social stability, and maintain the trust and confidence of the people in their government. In the case of Singapore, its rapid economic progress has been widely lauded and was a key factor in its ability to first become successful and then grow from strength to strength.",
                "Northern Uganda found that providing employment opportunities to former combatants was a crucial factor in reducing crime rates and social instability in the region.\nHowever, one may rightly argue that the pursuit of economic gains should not be the only priority of government policies, as issues such as income inequality, the environment, and healthcare also require significant attention. Yet, it should be recognized that these issues are intrinsically linked to economic performance. A faltering economy would mean that the government lacks the necessary financial resources to address these problems effectively. In contrast, a robust economy provides the government with the resources to combat income inequality through the provision of social welfare programmes and the implementation of progressive taxation policies. It also allows for investment in healthcare, education, and environmental protection for both the present and future generations. Hence, economic progress and its associated gains are prerequisites for the government to effectively tackle these issues.\nIn conclusion, while the pursuit of economic gains may not be the only priority of government policies, it should be the primary concern. This is because a strong economy is necessary to address the basic needs of citizens, ensure political and social stability, and provide the government with the resources to tackle issues such as income inequality, healthcare, and environmental protection. As Singapore's economic success aptly demonstrates, a thriving economy is the foundation for the attainment of any other aspirations and goals.",
                "Northern Uganda discovered that economic improvements created through the program led to significantly lower levels of community-based violence.\nFurthermore, economic gains from government policies also indirectly reinforce social stability. The increasing affluence from the economic development allows for better education and healthcare, leading to increased opportunities for personal growth for the citizens. This, in turn, fosters a more contented and socially responsible population, which can lead to a virtuous cycle of societal advancement. As Singapore's famous founder, Lee Kuan Yew, succinctly put it in a speech at the Harvard Club of New York in 1988, \"Prosperity stabilises.\"\nThis is not to say that economic growth should completely override other concerns. Governments must also ensure that economic policies are sustainable and not implemented at the cost of the environment or at the expense of the welfare of minority groups. A balance must be achieved where economic gains are not pursued on the backs of the vulnerable or through unsustainable methods. In the Singapore context, the government has taken steps to ensure an environmentally sustainable growth, such as promoting the use of renewables and adopting eco-friendly practices. The government has also undertaken measures to address social inequities, such as providing affordable housing and healthcare for all citizens. These efforts show that while economic growth is paramount, it should not be pursued at the cost of the well-being of the people and the environment.\nIn conclusion, government policies should be primarily concerned with economic gains for three key reasons: to ensure that basic societal needs are met, to foster political stability and effective governance, and to create social stability. While there must be a balance to ensure that economic growth is sustainable and equitable, the benefits of a strong economy cannot be overlooked. Singapore's success story serves as an example of how a strong economy can lead to an increased standard of living and improved opportunities for a nation's citizens.",
                "Northern Uganda found that job creation and economic development were key factors that influenced the success of the programme. In addition, the report noted that economic opportunities helped to prevent a return to conflict as they reduced the risk of poverty and increased social stability.\nIn conclusion, while there may be potential drawbacks in focusing too heavily on economic gains as the primary concern of government policies, the fact remains that this is the most fundamental and essential task of any government, if it is to fulfill its basic duties towards its citizens. More importantly, economic growth and development often translate into social and political stability, which are prerequisites to any other objectives that a government may seek to pursue. As exemplified by the Singaporean case, the transformation of a country from a third world status to a first-world status has been chiefly enabled by a strong focus on econmoic growth, often at the expense of civil liberties, which have over the years been gradually improving, and will likely continue to improve, as economic growth is here to stay.",
                "Colombia on ex-combatants from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia found that financial incentives were a key factor in ensuring their successful integration into society.\nFurthermore, economic gains do not merely have a direct bearing on social stability; they also help to indirectly address social problems by generating resources for the government to invest in programmes or initiatives that cater specifically to the needs of disadvantaged groups. In Singapore, the government has implemented a range of schemes to support low-income families, including subsidies for healthcare and education, as well as targeted financial assistance for other basic necessities. These programmes, funded by the country's strong economic growth, have helped to ensure that even the most vulnerable members of society are able to meet their basic needs and improve their overall standard of living. In China, sustainable economic development has enabled the government to provide resources for large-scale poverty reduction projects in rural areas, such as the poverty alleviation programme that lifted more than 55 million people out of poverty in 2019. Thus, while economic gains should not be the sole focus of government policies, it is clear that they are crucial for a government to be able to address social issues and ensure a stable, secure and prosperous society for all. \n\nIn conclusion, the pursuit of economic gains should be the main concern of government policies, as it helps to ensure the physical well-being of individuals, generate resources for long-term planning, enhance political stability, and promote social stability by providing resources for the government to invest in social programmes that uplift disadvantaged groups. Nonetheless, it must be balanced with a sensitivity to the potential harms, such as income inequality and environmental degradation, and mitigating measures and policies put in place to ensure the sustainable and responsible economic development.",
                "East Africa found that economic opportunities were critical in reducing violence, as individuals who had access to economic opportunities were less likely to be involved in violent activities. This demonstrates the close relationship between economic development and social stability, making economic gains a crucial focus of government policies.\nIt is, however, important to note that while economic growth should be prioritised, it should not come at the expense of environmental sustainability or the well-being of the weaker and more vulnerable members of society. As Singapore's Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, has stated in his National Day Rally speeches, economic growth must be balanced with social safety nets, healthcare and education for the less advantaged. Additionally, Singapore is also strongly committed to sustainable development, implementing policies and initiatives to reduce its carbon footprint and to promote environmentally responsible behaviour amongst its citizens.\nIn conclusion, while economic gains should be the main concern of government policies, it is also crucial to address the potential negative consequences that can arise from a myopic pursuit of economic growth. By balancing economic gains with social stability, environmental sustainability and the well-being of vulnerable members of society, governments can ensure that economic growth leads to tangible and sustainable improvements in the quality of life of its citizens.",
                "Uganda found that the main reason why former combatants were willing to lay down their arms was because they were offered better economic opportunities than as part of the ongoing conflict. Hence, it is clear that economic gains must be pursued as the primary objective of government policies, as the resulting reduction or even elimination of poverty and the improved standards of living will undoubtedly lead to a more socially stable Singapore.\n\nIn conclusion, while acknowledging possible negative consequences of economic growth, it is essential for the government to prioritize economic gains as the key focus of its policies, as it provides Singapore with a more decent standard of living, and increases the nation's competitiveness, as well as ensuring political and social stability. A strong economy is fundamental to any country's well-being, and without it, governments would find it challenging to implement effective policies that benefit the public over the long term. As much as government policymakers should pay attention to potential issues arising from economic growth such as income inequality and environmental degradation, they must prioritize economic prosperity in order to address these issues effectively.",
                "Uganda found that participants who received vocational training and economic support were less likely to engage in criminal activities and had higher social integration scores compared to those who did not receive such support.\nFurthermore, economic gains indirectly lead to social stability by providing governments with the means to fund social welfare schemes, healthcare and education. With an increase in government revenue, resources can be redirected to provide social security for its citizens and ensure that basic needs are being met. Singapore, for example, has implemented a comprehensive healthcare system, quality education, and affordable housing for its citizens \u2013 all of which would be impossible without a strong economy generating the revenue needed to fund such initiatives. Contrast that with Venezuela, a country with a floundering economy that is unable to sustain basic services such as garbage collection, education and healthcare. Such conditions aggravate social unrest and hinder any possibility of social stability. Thus, economic gains should continue to be the primary objective of Singapore's government policy as it leads to a stable and secure society.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that an overemphasis on economic gains at the expense of other factors such as environmental protection and income inequality can result in unsatisfactory conditions for society.  While economic development is important, long-term sustainability and the well-being of the population must remain in focus. In conclusion, the government's primary concern should always revolve around making the country a hospitable place for its people to live. While economic gains may not necessarily be the only means towards that end, it has undoubtedly proven to be a decisive factor that facilitates the attainment of that primary goal."

Singapore, being an urbanized island city-state, is particularly vulnerable to such impacts. As such, our government has been proactive in implementing policies that promote environmental sustainability, such as encouraging the use of public transport and renewable energy, investing in green infrastructure, and enforcing strict regulations on industrial emissions. These measures help to ensure that economic growth is achieved in a sustainable way, so that the benefits can be enjoyed by future generations as well.\n\nLastly, government policies should also take into account cultural preservation. Economic growth should not come at the cost of destroying a nation's heritage and identity. In Singapore, we have a diverse mix of cultures and traditions, which are a source of pride and unity for us. The government has thus implemented policies to safeguard our cultural heritage, such as preserving historical landmarks, supporting local arts and crafts, and promoting intercultural exchange. Such policies help to ensure that economic growth is achieved in a way that respects our cultural roots and promotes social harmony.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic growth is undoubtedly important, government policies should not solely prioritize economic gains. Rather, policies should be holistic, taking into account social welfare, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation, in order to ensure that the benefits of economic growth are shared by all members of society.

Singapore, as a city-state with limited land area, faces unique environmental challenges such as urbanization and high energy consumption. Therefore, our government has taken a proactive approach towards sustainability by implementing policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase the use of renewable energy, and improve waste management. These measures are essential to preserve the environment for future generations, and demonstrate that economic gains and environmental sustainability are not mutually exclusive.\n\nFinally, governments should also consider the importance of preserving their country's cultural heritage. Cultural diversity is a valuable asset that contributes to a nation's identity and social cohesion. In Singapore, where we are a melting pot of different cultures and ethnicities, the government has recognized the importance of cultural preservation by implementing policies to promote the study of our history, preserve our traditional arts and crafts, and safeguard our intangible cultural heritage. This shows that government policies should not solely focus on economic gains at the expense of cultural heritage.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that while economic gains are important, government policies should not be solely concerned with them.

Besides economic growth, the government has also invested in cultural institutions, arts programs, and heritage sites to promote our unique cultural landscape. Such policies are essential in ensuring that our national identity and cultural heritage are not lost in the pursuit of economic growth.\n\nTo conclude, while economic gains are vital for a country's development, government policies should not be concerned solely with them. Social welfare, environmental sustainability, and cultural preservation should also be taken into account when crafting policies.

            "human_gen_truncate": "se of the financial sector, and research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis go as far as to suggest that these millennials might be unable to accumulate sufficient wealth for retirement. Younger millennials born in the 1990s and 2000s have to contend with economic uncertainties like the US-China trade war, the implications of climate change on supply chains, and rapid unprecedented rates of technological disruption to traditional industries. This is a vast contrast to the situation in Singapore'searly days of economic development in the 1960s and 1970s which saw the creation of large numbers of jobs in the rapidly growing manufacturing industry, and strong and sustained economic growth rates. Furthermore, with the winds of globalization blowing strong today, competition between economies has intensified, making it imperative for local employees to constantly upgrade themselves to ensure that they can continue to value-add to their companies in order to remain employed. Young people in Singapore today thus face greater pressure to remain competitive and employable, contrary to the perception that they lead smooth-sailing lives with their whole lives charted out for them.\nAdditionally, while young people today are generally more educated than past generations, the overall increase in education standards means that there are greater expectations to do well academically and it is even more difficult for one to stand out amongst a sea of university students, especially when 4 in 10 Singaporean youth will eventually be degree holders. Moreover, the influx of foreign talents in recent years has raised the bar for many graduates, making it more competitive in getting jobs. As a result, young people, despite being given more education opportunities, now face greater difficulty in getting their desired jobs, and often have to make do with jobs that do not match their qualifications or aspirations. A recent research study conducted by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute suggest a pernicious, worrying underbelly of underemployed millennial graduates, some of whom are earning less than $2,000 a month from their full-time jobs despite their education qualifications. This suggests that young people in Singapore may not necessarily be better off compared to past generations when we take into consideration the increasingly competitive and uncertain job landscape in which they have to survive and thrive in today.\nBesides, the steadily rising costs of living in Singapore is another reason that Singaporeans today may not enjoy an easier life compared to previous generations. Soaring Certificate of Entitlement (COE) for the purchase of motor vehicles and sky-rocketing property prices are but a few of the indicators of inflation. Singapore'sheadline inflation has gradually been on an upward trend, and the cost of purchasing a home or a car in Singapore far exceeds that in other countries. Increasingly, Singaporeans are finding themselves having to tighten their belts to cope with this. Although it is undeniably true that all Singaporeans, both young and old, are affected by the high living costs, young people are more likely to bear the brunt as costs continue to climb, which means they may have to work even harder and longer hours than their parents and grandparents. Today, young people in Singapore take on part-time jobs and freelance gigs such as driving for Grab or Gojek in order to supplement the income from their full-time job, and this presumably complements the observation that millennials in Singapore work 49 hours a week, with 1 out of 4 working two jobs at a time. As a consequence, health issues such as stress, fatigue and even depression could well ensue. In this sense, the higher standards of living that young Singaporeans enjoy today must be viewed in the light of the heavier financial burden imposed by rising living costs.\nIn our world which is increasingly fraught with fear, insecurity and uncertainty, the young are living in a Singapore that is beset with novel challenges that previous generations did not have to grapple with. As the famous historian R G Collingwood once said, \"every new generation must rewrite history in its own way\". In this light, when assessing this or any generation, both the positive and the challenging aspects must be taken into account. Therefore, notwithstanding the better education or job opportunities available to this generation, it would be inaccurate to say that the young in Singapore never had it good if we understand also the myriad issues surrounding today'sgeneration.",

Singapore has excellent public transportation, modern hospitals, world-class shopping centers, and parks, among other things. With low crime rates and a clean environment, we enjoy a high quality of life that is enviable to those living in other parts of the world.\n\nDespite these advantages, we must also acknowledge that not all young people in Singapore have equal access to these opportunities and privileges. Income inequality in Singapore is a persistent issue, and some young people may be unable to access the same resources as their more affluent peers. Education and technology may be available, but not everyone has the financial means to make the most of them. For example, not everyone has access to the latest devices and the internet at home, which can hamper learning and opportunities for self-improvement.\n\nFurthermore, mental health issues, such as stress and anxiety, are prevalent in our society, and young people are not immune to these challenges. The pressure to succeed, particularly in academics, can take a toll on a young person's mental health, and there may not be enough resources available to address these concerns. While mental health awareness has improved in recent years, more needs to be done to destigmatize these issues and provide accessible mental health support for all.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that young people in Singapore have never had it so good in certain aspects, there are still many challenges that we face as a generation. It is essential to recognize that not all young people have equal access to these opportunities, and society must work to level the playing field.

In addition to this, the political arena in Singapore and all around the world has also become increasingly volatile and unpredictable. Since the foundational years of Singapore's independence, the island nation has encountered political stability, high economic growth and progress both domestically and regionally.

This is further amplified by challenges such as rising debt burdens and escalating levels of education fees. As such, it is unfair to regard young people as being cushioned and shielded from the challenges of life. Moreover, in the social and political domains, young people carry the weight of societal expectations to be well-informed and actively engaged in shaping social and political issues. This pressure to stay informed and to think critically is heightened by the deluge of information available through social media and other online platforms where fake news is rife and progressive discussions are often drowned out by extremist opinions. This exposure to a range of ideas does not necessarily translate to greater knowledge or understanding, but rather creates a new layer of confusion and ambiguity, which requires young people to remain constantly vigilant.\nPerhaps, then, what differentiates our youth'sexperience from the challenges that their grandparents faced is the form in which they manifest. While young people today enjoy access to better education, healthcare and standards of living, they have to grapple with more complex challenges involving a rapidly changing social and political climate. Therefore, to argue that \"young people today have never had it so good\" is overly simplistic and fails to capture the nuances of their experiences.",

In addition, the increasing cost of living means that young people today in Singapore have to be even more frugal with their finances than in the past. Prices of basic necessities such as housing, healthcare and education have all escalated over time, forcing young people to be wise with their spending if they want to ensure financial security in the future.\nAnother challenge that the youth face today is pressure in the social and psychological domains. Many young people feel immense pressure to conform to social norms and expectations. The prevalence of social media has made this even more intense as young people are exposed to a myriad of curated lifestyles and perfect images of others, leading to unrealistic expectations about their lives and causing undue stress. Additionally, stress from school assignments and exams can lead to mental health issues such as anxiety and depression. The notion that young people today have it easier therefore does not take into account the emotional burdens they have to face every day.\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that young people today in Singapore enjoy many privileges that their predecessors did not, it is crucial to acknowledge that they face new and unique challenges in today's world. The pressure to succeed in an ever-changing global economy and the emotional burden of conforming to societal norms and expectations are just some examples of the challenges that young people encounter every day. Therefore, it would be simplistic to say that young people today have never had it so good and fail to note the complex realities of their lives.",

The soaring costs of housing and healthcare make it difficult for young people to achieve financial independence, let alone start families.\n\nFurthermore, political and social issues today also pose great challenges to the youth in Singapore. Despite Singapore's emphasis on racial harmony and religious tolerance, instances of hate speech and xenophobic attitudes on social media platforms have been increasing in recent years. Young people today also face the challenge of finding their voice in a highly regulated political landscape where dissent and public protests are highly discouraged. Issues like climate change, income inequality, and geopolitical tensions have also raised concerns about the future of the world and the role that younger generations will play in shaping it.\n\nIn conclusion, while young people in Singapore do enjoy a higher standard of living, better education opportunities, and access to technology that previous generations did not, it is important to note that they also face their own unique set of challenges. The ease and convenience of modern life sometimes take away from the anxiety and unease caused by a rapidly changing world.

The rise of social media and the internet has led to greater awareness and pressure on young people to conform to certain social norms and cultural expectations. Moreover, the needs and aspirations of the young have also presented unique challenges to the government, especially in areas such as housing and healthcare. These challenges, combined with the ever-increasing cost of living, mean that life for young people in Singapore can be just as stressful and difficult as it was for past generations.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that young people in Singapore today enjoy certain advantages that their predecessors did not have, this does not mean that they lead easier lives. In fact, they face a new set of challenges that require them to be resilient, adaptable and resourceful in order to overcome them. While we should certainly celebrate the progress that we have made in improving the lives of young people, we should not be complacent and recognise the difficulties that they face in the modern world.

The repercussions of this crisis were felt by many young people who entered the job market then and the years that followed, making it increasingly difficult to secure employment or to earn enough to sustain their livelihoods. Moreover, navigating the gig economy, with its inherent instability and precariousness in terms of job security, creates a sense of anxiety and uncertainty that previous generations did not have to contend with. This is has become even more pertinent in the current climate, where the global pandemic has created massive job losses and affected the economic stability of many countries, including Singapore.\nIn addition to economic challenges, young people today are also facing new social pressures. Increased usage of social media and the internet has created a toxic environment where youths find it hard to separate their online and offline lives and where cyberbullying and online harassment are becoming increasingly commonplace. This online world becomes inescapable for young people, leading to unprecedented mental health issues, anxiety and resultant poorer quality of life. This generation is also grappling with increased social polarisation, as social media algorithms drive individuals into echo chambers and reinforce perspectives by suggesting content that confirms pre-existing beliefs, further exacerbating divides between differing political and social opinions.\nIn conclusion, while it may be true that youth in Singapore have much better access to education and enjoy higher standards of living than ever before, it is also important to recognise that they face a host of new and ever-evolving challenges that cannot be dismissed lightly.

Additionally, the current pandemic has severely hit businesses and has led to widespread job loss and retrenchment in various sectors. Young people, especially fresh graduates who lack experience and a robust network, have been hit hard by these developments, challenging the notion that young people today have never had it so good in terms of their economic situation.\nFurthermore, young people today also face new challenges in the realm of politics and social issues. While Singapore is a relatively safe and politically stable country, recent events like the #MeToo movement, the Black Lives Matter protests, and growing concerns over climate change have thrust young people into the forefront of political activism and discourse, challenging their beliefs and ensuring they stay informed about current world affairs. This may lead to increased pressure on young people to take a stand on social and political issues, placing additional responsibilities and expectations on them to engage with the larger community in a meaningful way.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that compared to past generations, young people in Singapore today enjoy greater access to education and higher standards of living, the new set of challenges and uncertainties that they face means that the notion that young people today have never had it so good is an oversimplification. The rapidly changing world, coupled with economic, political, and social challenges, have created a much more complex and daunting environment for young people to navigate.

Many feel that they are living in an increasingly fragmented world where traditional values are being challenged by new perspectives on issues like gender identity, sexuality and mental health. This, coupled with the pervasiveness of social media, presents new and different challenges from those faced by previous generations. Today's awareness of mental health means that many young people in Singapore are struggling with the effects of stress, anxiety and depression, and they must learn to cope with these mental health issues while managing the demands of school or work.\nIn conclusion, while young people in Singapore today have access to education and enjoy higher standards of living, we must not overlook the unique challenges they face in this day and age. It is also important to remember that while the level of economic prosperity may have increased, this does not necessarily translate into guaranteed happiness or a life free of struggle.

Furthermore, the cost of living has been steadily rising in recent years, meaning that even with higher incomes, the standard of living may not have necessarily improved across the board. For many young people, homeownership in Singapore's sky-high, unpredictable property market may seem like a pipe dream, and the ever-increasing costs of healthcare, education and retirement savings pose significant financial challenges.\nAdditionally, there is an increasing sense of societal pressure on young people to succeed and conform to high expectations set on academic and career fronts, further compounding the mounting sense of personal failure in case of non-compliance. Singapore youth today are exposed and vulnerable to the negative impacts of social media and technology, leading to a disturbing increase in mental health issues resulting from an overwhelming sense of failure, loneliness and self-worth. Denying these challenges faced by Singapore's youth would not be acknowledging the reality of being young in Singapore today. \nIn conclusion, while the narrative that young people have never had it so good permeates through Singapore society remains partially true, we must also recognise the complex challenges young people face today. The world's changing economic landscape and the accompanying pressures of conforming to social standards and expectations in Singapore continue to place a heavy toll on young people.

Until recently, much faith has been placed in costly climate-change solutions such as solar panels, biofuels and carbon capture technology. Yet, these examples of green technology have not proven to be the panacea that they are touted to be. As long as wind turbines and solar panels remain more expensive than fossil fuels while working only intermittently, they will never be the solution to our energy woes. As of 2016, Germany, the world'slargest per capita consumer of solar energy, produces just 6.6% percent of its energy. And to achieve this number one status, the country has invested $130 billion in return for $12 billion worth of energy. The net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the century? Just 23 hours. Similarly, biofuel production is now consuming 40 percent of the US corn harvest, even though it supplies only 4 percent of the transport fuel used in America. Around the world, the turn to biofuel crops is resulting in higher food prices \u2013 and hence increased hunger. It is estimated that if the European Union were to derive 10 percent of their transport fuels from biofuels, the price of food could increase astronomically by 76% or deprive an additional 600 million people of food. Indeed, the prevalent belief in green technology to save our earth has proven disappointing and constitutes yet another reason for explaining why it has been so difficult to save the environment. But this should not lead us to despair as there is now a growing consensus that we should divert some of the attention and resources on green initiatives to producing solutions for more obvious and needy problems, which would hopefully generate positive knock-on effects for the environment. World Wide Fund for Nature in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand has introduced blockchain technology to track the migration of tuna, allowing scientific researchers an insight into global fishing, vessel traffic, and the potential effects of overfishing. The World Research Institute has also incorporated an open-source online forest monitoring and alert system which depends on data contribution from users on the ground to investigate forest health and deter illegal logging. Poco a poco, these small steps which are dependent on mass collaboration and effort have had a transformative effect on the way in which we tackle the effect of anthropogenic activities on the environment.\nTurning to the domestic level, a crucial aspect to understanding why it is so difficult to save the environment is local politics, and the lack of political will on a local level. In the United States, the world'ssecond largest emitter of greenhouse gases, politicians often ride into office on a ticket sponsored by large corporations with considerable vested interests. Corporatism is literally entrenched in the American constitution and in its politics. Profit-seeking corporations often hope that the politicians they endorse will implement policies that allow them to make more profits, and politicians are thus beholden to their powerful backers. As such, politicians are unlikely to implement policies that can help the environment but which may hurt businesses, for fear of offending their corporate sponsors and ruining their political careers. For instance, it is well-known that many Washington politicians have links to \"Big Oil\" \u2013 influential companies dealing in oil and energy. During his first month in office, President George W. Bush appointed Vice-President Dick Cheney to head a task force charged with developing the country'senergy policy. The group \u2013 which conducted its meetings in secret \u2013 relied on the recommendations of Big Oil behemoths Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP America and Chevron. It would be the first of many moves to come during the Bush administration that would position oil and gas companies well ahead of other energy interests with billions of dollars in subsidies and tax cuts \u2013 payback for an industry with strong ties to the administration and plenty of money to contribute to congressional and presidential campaigns. However, the good news is that in many countries, \"green parties\", which are political parties who campaign on the platform of environmental conservation are slowly but steadily gaining popularity and votes among the electorate who is also becoming more well-informed about environmental issues thanks to greater media attention and coverage. Millennial politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have placed environmental advocacy at the forefront of their political agenda and have proposed drastic measures like the Green New Deal, suggesting a paradigm shift towards greater political will to solve pertinent environmental issues.\nIn the final analysis, while history has shown us that the obstacles to saving our planet are real and formidable, recent changes in mindsets, policies and practices provide us with hope that they are not insurmountable. In time to come, the optimist in me believes that these hurdles can be removed as we work towards a cooperative yet realistic stance on saving our environment both at the international and local levels.",

Therefore, it is evident that technological innovations have made it possible to develop sustainable solutions that can save the environment.\n\nFurthermore, environmental conservation is not just about saving the planet. It also has economic benefits. For instance, eco-tourism provides an alternative source of revenue for countries that rely on natural resources. Tourists are willing to pay to visit natural habitats, such as national parks and nature reserves, providing income for local communities. Sustainable agriculture is another example of how environmental conservation can have economic benefits. By promoting sustainable farming practices, farmers can reduce their impact on the environment while increasing their crop yields, leading to higher profits. Therefore, environmental conservation has economic benefits that should not be overlooked.\n\nHowever, environmental conservation efforts have not been without challenges. One significant challenge is the lack of political willpower. Environmental conservation often requires significant policy changes that can be politically difficult to implement. For instance, policies that require corporations to reduce their waste production can face significant opposition from business interests that prioritize profits over the environment. Lack of financial resources is also another significant challenge to environmental conservation efforts, as it can be costly to implement eco-friendly solutions. Public attitudes towards environmental conservation can also be a challenge, as some people may view it as an inconvenience rather than a necessity. Addressing these challenges will require significant effort and collaboration between various stakeholders.\n\nIn conclusion, the argument that we should stop trying to save the environment is not valid.

Man-made activities, which pose a significant threat to the environment, make it necessary to continue environmental conservation efforts. Technological innovations have made it possible to develop sustainable solutions that can help save the environment while also providing economic benefits.

Schools and educational institutions should also incorporate environmental education into their syllabus to encourage young people to be more environmentally-conscious and to develop the skills needed to challenge the environmental status quo in the future. These societal changes in attitudes and behaviors may only seem like small steps but they are necessary to create a foundation for larger change.\n\nIn conclusion, although it is easy to be discouraged given the difficulties that we face in attempting to save the environment, we should not stop trying. The efforts of both developed and developing nations have demonstrated that the gulf that separates them in terms of environmental conservation is gradually closing. The realization that economic growth and environmental conservation can be complementary rather than mutually exclusive is also making it possible to change businesses' attitudes towards environmental protection.

In Singapore, for example, we have traditionally struggled with waste management, with our landfills rapidly approaching capacity. This issue is compounded by the fact that Singapore lacks the physical space to increase its waste disposal landfills without sacrificing other critical land use needs such as housing, industrialization, and recreation. However, Singapore is actively implementing effective waste management measures, such as increasing recycling efforts and generating power from incineration. Similarly, as individuals, Singaporeans carry certain attitudes and habits that are outdated and detrimental to the environment. Practices such as excessive use of air conditioning, widespread use of plastic bags, and failure to separate recyclables from general waste have been noted as the main culprits for our poor environmental record. However, educational initiatives, supported by government actions, have been shown to change such behavior, as Singapore's NEA has demonstrated with their concerted efforts in educating the public and businesses on the importance of eco-friendliness.\nIn conclusion, the statement that \"given the difficulties, we should stop trying to save the environment\" is a callous and short-sighted response to the more significant issue of environmental degradation. The difficulties in saving our planet are not insurmountable, and we should not be discouraged by the challenges we face in this regard. Instead, we should realize that the opportunities and benefits of environmental conservation far outweigh the costs, and that an environmental approach to development is a necessary and realistic path for sustainable development.

Rightly understood, the pursuit of sustainable economic growth ought not to be viewed as a trade-off against the environment, but rather as a necessary precondition for the environment's preservation.

Often, politicians tend to prioritize short-term economic gains and their re-election prospects over longer-term environmental goals. However, this situation is starting to change as the public becomes more aware and vocal about environmental issues. Recently, we have witnessed unprecedented global movements such as youth climate strikes and Extinction Rebellion which have galvanized public opinion and pressured governments to take more decisive actions. Leaders such as Emmanuel Macron of France and Jacinda Ardern of New Zealand have also declared a \"climate emergency\", while leaders of the European Union have pledged to make their bloc carbon-neutral by 2050. Closer to home, Singapore has recently unveiled its Green Plan 2030 which aims to enhance the country's sustainability efforts through investments in green energy and sustainable infrastructure. These exemplary policies, if accompanied by clear targets and robust policy instruments, can signal a new era of environmental stewardship and inspire other countries to join in this effort.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that saving the environment is a difficult task, it is not an impossible one. The challenges faced in this endeavor are multi-faceted and complex, ranging from economic, political, and social factors. However, we should not be discouraged by the difficulties as history has shown that concerted efforts among nations and communities can lead to genuine progress. The transformational power of technological innovation, the potential of economic growth to complement conservation efforts, and the growing public demand for effective environmental policies are all signs that a sustainable future is possible.

Through concerted efforts at the international level, as well as enlightened domestic policies that encourage responsible growth and sustainable development, we can strike a balance between economic growth and environmental conservation.

Through continued and sustained effort at both the international and domestic levels, we can gradually work towards narrowing the gulf between developed and developing countries, as well as debunking the myth of the trade-off between economic growth and environmental conservation. It is only through a collective and collaborative effort that we can meaningfully work towards safeguarding the planet \u2013 for ourselves, for future generations, and for the myriad of other living beings that also inhabit it."

            "prompt": "\"SPORT UNITES MORE THAN IT DIVIDES\". HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "football on the battlefield. This unexpected show of unity between men who at that point had been trying to kill each other for months is a clear example of the power of sport to bring communities together and give even the most hated of enemies a means of escape from the cycle of hatred that pervaded those times. In fact, the Olympic Truce can trace its origins to the 9th century, where Iphitos convinced other rulers to end any conflict for a week before and after the Olympic games in the spirit of sportsmanship and universal peace. The amazing unifying ability of sport to allow individuals to cast aside their differences and come together in the spirit of the games amplify the unique place sports occupy as an instrument for unification that is strong enough to bring people together even during the most divisive times in human history.\nHowever, when passion for sport is taken too far, it can lead to an excessive and unhealthy rivalry amongst athletes and their fans which could have a divisive effect on the community instead. When passion is taken to extremes and transforms into unwarranted hatred and violence amongst rival fans and players, this can lead to an incredibly divisive and unstable atmosphere that could lead to hostility and even violence. This was unfortunately seen during the 2016 European Championships in France where rival fans took their sporting rivalries too far and engaged in violent brawls with opposing fans throughout the tournament leading to many being thrown behind bars and even more ending up in hospitals due to the mass violence and chaos that these confrontations caused. Instead of being a time for fans to come together over the spectacle that was supposed to be Euro 2016, the hyper-intensified passions and rivalries of these fans caused the tournament to be marred by violence and resulted in divisive sentiments amongst the different countries and their supporters, who pushed the blame to one another for the outbreak of the violence. Thus, when taken to excess, passion and rivalry in sport can transform into mass hysteria and violence, leading to the division of sporting communities as they begin to clash over their loyalties and overzealously express their support through violence.\nFurthermore, when sport is exploited to push political agendas, it can be used as a tool to create divisive sentiments, which goes against the true spirit of sportsmanship. Despite many believing that sport and politics should remain at arm'slength from each other, political agendas and sentiment often creep into sport as governments sometimes see it as one of the easiest and most publicly visible avenues to drive ideas and agendas, some of which are detrimental to harmony. One example of this exploitation of sport can be seen through the recent denial of visas for two Pakistani shooters to enter India to participate in the shooting World Cup. This was attributed to India'sbelief that Pakistan has not done enough to tackle the violent militias hiding within its borders. This fuels the international and domestic narratives that India is trying to champion, which is that Pakistan is a terror state and that it should not be trusted. This blatant use of sport as a political tool disregards the rights of athletes to free and fair competition. It also uses sport to push political agendas in a highly visible public setting, leading to the rise of division as these actions are debated and even championed by some in the public. When governing bodies go against the spirit of sport and use it for their own political gain, it can lead to greater divisions in society as the use of such a publicly visible medium often riles up support for these actions and in turn causes people to see these divisive acts as justifiable and necessary.\nUltimately, sport on its own is designed to unite communities through the shared values and interests associated with sport. Sport allows individuals to grow and learn together, giving people an avenue to interact while leaving all preconceived notions and animosities at the door, allowing them to see past their differences and bond as human beings with the same shared interests. However, if the competitive nature of sport is taken too far without restraint, or if sport is used as a means to a political end in particular, we detract from the inclusive nature of sport, and inadvertently promote divisive violence and animosity throughout society. Thus, despite the fact that sport does unite much more than it divides, if left unchecked and allowed to continuously be exploited, sport could become one of the greatest tools to divide communities around the world.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " that can be applied both on the field and off the field. For example, teamwork plays a significant role in sports like football and basketball. It is important to understand your role and work well with teammates to achieve common goals, positively affecting not only the team's performance but also their personal growth. Participating in team sports also teaches individuals the importance of discipline, hard work, and perseverance. It is not just about winning and losing, but understanding strengths and weaknesses, working on them, and continuously striving to be a better player and a more well-rounded person.\n\nOn the other hand, it is not to assume that sports cannot become a source of division. When competition is intense, emotions run high and sometimes, result in conflicts. Rivalry between teams, whether it be rival football clubs or national teams, has been known to result in violence and discord. For instance, the Division I league finals in football, dubbed the El Clasico between Real Madrid and FC Barcelona, has been known to ignite deep-seated hatred among fans and has even caused conflicts between Spanish regions.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that sports serve as an essential means of bringing people together. Sports do not discriminate nor do they care about race, gender, or religion. It is a universal language, with its rules, and traditions uniting people across nations and borders. Sporting events have the potential to transform relationships, mend political relations between countries and create bonds of friendship that last for lifetimes. While there is no doubt that sports can sometimes be a source of conflict, it is negligible compared to the numerous benefits that sports bring. Sport promotes values of respect, teamwork, and discipline, instilling essential life skills in individuals that allow them to become strong-willed men and women who can endure any challenge that comes their way.

This showed that sport has the power to create new friendships and links to individuals, that go far beyond the sport itself while bridging the gap of mistrust and hatred that had sprung up as a result of the civil war.\nIn conclusion, despite instances where it has been used to push certain agendas, sport undeniably has a greater power to foster unity and co-existence. Through the power of sport, people from different backgrounds are given the opportunity to come together and see past their differences, building communities and promoting genuine understanding. Sport serves as a potent tool to unite and find cohesion in communities which makes it important for every individual in the world to take part and promote unity through sport.",

It is important to note that while sport can be a uniting force, it is only as strong as the people who participate in it and the values they uphold. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the spirit of sport remains untainted and that it continues to serve its purpose of uniting people through their shared love of sport.\nIn conclusion, while there may be instances of sport being used to propagate dangerous ideas, it is undeniable that it has the immense power to bring together individuals from all walks of life. Its ability to blur racial lines, reduce distances, and bring people together in times of chaos demonstrate why it has the potential to unite society far more than it divides it.

The program aims to bring children of various ethnic backgrounds and religious affiliations together to focus on the shared goal of playing football, instead of their differences, which has led to unprecedented levels of camaraderie between the groups. Therefore, it is clear that during times of unrest and conflict, sport can serve as an important unifying force that brings people together, even from opposite sides of the conflict.\nIn conclusion, while sport has been used at times to push divisive agendas, it is clear that it has a unique ability to bring people together, breaking down barriers of race, nationality and even deep rooted enmities.

This short period of peace and unity showed that even in the face of conflict and violence, sport has the power to bring people together and promote healing in societies that have been torn apart by war or other forms of discord.\nHowever, one must acknowledge that there are instances when sport can contribute to division and conflict. For instance, football hooliganism is a serious issue in many countries where heated football rivalries between supporters of different clubs often result in violence and disturbances. Also, there are times when sport has been a platform for political propaganda or has been used to deepen existing divides. A well-known example is the 1936 Berlin Olympics held under Nazi Germany, where Hitler and the Nazi regime utilised the games as a tool for propaganda and to bolster their nationalist ideology.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that there are instances where sport can be divisive, such as when rivalries turn violent, this does not negate the power sport has to unite people across racial, religious and geographical lines. Its uniqueness lies in its ability to bring people together, create bonds and lessen tensions. The shared experience of a game or tournament indeed has the remarkable capacity to create common ground and eradicate prejudice, war and other forms of discord.

Hence, this further attests to how sports can transcend differences and unite people where it seems impossible.\nDespite the divisive actions that some individuals may take around sport, it is evident that the positives of sport far outweigh the negatives. The unifying power of sports brings people together across cultures, borders and even wars. It allows individuals to see each other as equals and as people who are capable of putting aside their differences for a common interest.

Sport has long been a powerful movement that has broken down race, religion, politics and social and cultural barriers, proving it to be a unifying force. It combines the worlds of passion and community to create a synergy that transcends conventional societal norms.

Sporting events, particularly ones of national significance, have the power to rejuvenate and re-energise a community in the face of tragedy, promoting a sense of community and solidarity that transcends whatever divides may exist between them.\n\nIn conclusion, sport is undoubtedly a powerful tool that has the ability to unite and engender a sense of harmony amongst people from all walks of life, whether it be across racial, geographical, or cultural barriers.

However, despite such negative instances, the majority of the sporting world views sports as a force for good in society, as highlighted by the United Nations which designated 6 April as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace.\nIn conclusion, while there are examples where sport has been used as a tool for divisiveness, it is undeniable that sport has the unique ability to unite people and nations, bridging differences and providing common ground where individuals can bond over their shared passion without being held hostage to any deep-seated hatred and biases.

            "prompt": "IS THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY WORTHWHILE?",
            "human_gen_truncate": " found, like a wild flower, all over his dear country\". This suggests that individual freedoms are worth fighting for, and as established earlier, the erosion of the right to privacy ultimately cumulates into the erosion of individual freedoms, and should thus be decried. The right to have a life that is private and non privy to the prying eyes of the state is thus essential despite the risks it entails as without privacy, individuals will not be able to live their lives the way the want and express their true selves, effectively destroying the uniqueness and imaginative joy that makes life worth living.\nHowever, with the rising threat of crime and violence, the protection of privacy might not be as worthwhile as the need to protect people from acts of mass terror and violence may outweigh this. The ability to monitor individuals would allow states to better address the issues of rising crime and terror by giving them an avenue to better track individuals with a greater risk of being involved in criminal activities. States will also be able to set up alert systems to highlight any actions by individuals that could possibly lead to potentially damaging terrorist or criminal activity such as the planning of crimes of terror attacks by people within their borders. Allowing governments access to sensitive information would have allowed law enforcement agencies to prevent many of the attacks perpetrated by radicals and criminals such as the shooting at a mosque in Christchurch in March 2019 and the multiple school shootings that have taken place in America over the years. In fact, concerns about privacy have actively impeded pre-emptive measures and investigations. Former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief James Comey argued that encrypted messaging platforms, meant to safeguard the privacy of individual users, deprive governments and intelligence agencies of crucial information, \"giving terrorists a tremendous advantage against us\". Letting go of the desire for privacy might be the necessary sacrifice that will allow governments to finally get a step ahead of these criminals and extremists as the individualised nature of international terrorism and crime today makes it harder and harder for defence agencies to track and protect us against these threats, which could come from anywhere, even from the people living right next door. Relinquishing the right to privacy might be the only way to allow states to properly address the ever changing and complex network of international crime and terror, and protect us from the many different threats that are brewing just under the surface of society.\nThe protection of privacy is furthermore not worthwhile, as it may prevent people and states from taking responsibility for the actions and being held accountable. While privacy is largely individual, it also extends to states when they are being scrutinised by other nations. Allowing both states and individuals to hide behind the shield of privacy allows people of power to basically go about doing whatever they please without fear of condemnation, if they have significant enough means to keep news of their actions contained. For example, countries such as China have long been using the argument of privacy and national sovereignty to prevent the international community from properly investigating accusations of human rights violations against Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang that have been made against them. The country has used its power in the international community and political red tape to assert that what happens within the country is a private Chinese matter that the international community has no business in. Examples such as this illustrate how the idea of privacy can be used in order to prevent entities from being held accountable for their actions, instead hiding behind privacy as a means of burying and news about their actions. Thus, the protection of privacy is not worthwhile when privacy is just used as a tool to conceal the actions of people and states from the outside world in order to shield themselves from having to deal with the eventual repercussions of these actions, and continue to carry out these atrocities without fear of condemnation due to the protection that privacy give them.\nOverall, whether the protection of privacy is worthwhile depends heavily on the degree that our privacy would be taken away should we choose to stop defending it. Although the relaxing of privacy could have beneficial impacts to society by stopping people and countries from using it as a shield and be held accountable for their actions, and lead to states being more prepared and capable to address the threats that terrorism and crime have towards their communities, the complete relinquishment of privacy might in the long run lead to the loss of all individual freedoms and cause the countries of the world to descend into dystopian police states of our own making.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " that this difficulty in preserving privacy only underscores how important it truly is. We should not abandon our right to privacy simply because it is inconvenient or difficult to maintain.\n\nImportantly, there are many steps that individuals and organizations can take to help protect privacy. For example, companies can implement strong data protection policies, collect only necessary information, and be transparent about how data is used. Similarly, individuals can use tools like encryption and firewalls to protect their personal information online, be mindful of what they post on social media, and limit the amount of information they share with others.\n\nOne of the most important steps, however, is for societies to recognize the value of privacy and work to protect it - not just at an individual level, but also through legal and policy frameworks. This means ensuring that privacy laws are up-to-date and reflect the changing nature of technology, increasing transparency around government surveillance programs, and protecting the rights of individuals to control their own personal information.\n\nIn conclusion, the protection of privacy is undoubtedly worthwhile. While it may be difficult to maintain in today\u2019s rapidly changing world, the importance of privacy for individuals, society, and civil liberties cannot be overstated. Governments, organizations, and individuals must all work together to uphold this fundamental human right so that we can continue to enjoy the freedoms and liberties that we so cherish.",

The safety and welfare of the public should always be the top priority of any government, and in certain situations, individuals may have to compromise their rights to privacy for the greater good. The privacy rights of convicted criminals, for example, may be stripped away in order to protect society from future possible criminal acts. The same can be said for individuals who pose a significant threat to national security. But such exceptions could and should be made on a case-by-case basis that follows the rule of law, with clear guidelines on when and how privacy can be taken away.\nIn conclusion, while the protection of privacy is a cornerstone of individual freedoms, it should not be regarded as an absolute right as it could jeopardise the safety and welfare of society. Nevertheless, it is important for governments to find a balance that respects the privacy rights of individuals while also ensuring their security. The government should also be transparent in its approach towards privacy and make every effort to minimise intrusiveness in order to prevent a slide towards a police state. Ultimately, the protection of privacy is worthwhile, as it allows individuals to live a life that is free from external control and is essential to ensure the preservation of individual freedom and happiness.",
                "remembered\". Without these struggles, the concept of freedom and privacy might never have been achieved, and the happiness that comes from them would also be illusive. Therefore, the protection of privacy is worthwhile since it directly translates to the protection of individual freedom, which in turn greatly contributes to people'shappiness, a fundamental aspect of society.\nHowever, it must be acknowledged that in times of great crisis such as war or terrorist attacks, the need for governments to act in order to protect its people and prevent further harm may require them to infringe on people'srights to privacy. This has happened in the past, and examples include the United States' response to the 9/11 attacks which saw the creation of the Patriot Act, which allowed for increased surveillance and monitoring of individuals in the United States by the state. As such, it is important for governments to strike a balance between individual privacy and the need for security, and to explain this balance to their citizens in order to prevent suspicion and social unrest.\nIn conclusion, the protection of individual privacy and freedom is of utmost importance and worth fighting for, since it effectively protects people'srights to social, political and economic freedom, something that is intrinsically tied to people'slong-term happiness. However, the need for government to be able to care for and protect its citizens may require a degree of surveillance or monitoring, and as such, there must always be a balance between individual freedoms and the need for security.",

These historical examples show that individual rights and the right to privacy are worth fighting for and that they can bring about a better and happier future for everyone.\nIn conclusion, the protection of privacy plays a critical role in protecting individual rights and freedoms. While there may be arguments for the need to monitor individuals for the sake of crime and terrorism prevention, the protection of individual privacy should always take precedence. When individuals' privacy is threatened, it can ultimately lead to the loss of other fundamental rights. Therefore, a balance must be struck between the two, where governments are able to monitor potential risks to society, but in a manner that does not infringe onindividual rights, including the right to privacy. Ultimately, the protection of privacy is worthwhile as it forms the cornerstone of individual rights and the preservation of this right is necessary to safeguard the freedoms of individuals and greater societies the world over.",
                "remembered and respected, and obtained in the end that which he fought for- national independence and freedom\".\nHowever, while the protection of privacy is crucial for individual freedoms and thus happiness, it must also be weighed against the need for governments to protect the safety and welfare of their people. The risks associated with terrorism, crime and violence cannot be ignored, and governments have a responsibility to keep their people safe. The trade-off is complicated, and no clear resolution can be derived. A balance must be found between allowing for privacy and freedom, while implementing measures necessary to monitor and prevent potential threats to public safety. Therefore, in conclusion, I believe privacy protection is worthwhile to the extent that it does not hinder the government's ability to keep its citizens safe, and allows for individual freedom and happiness to flourish.",
                "remembered forever\" as the iconic quote from Braveheart goes. The desire for individual privacy rights and individual freedoms have been the foundation of many historic events that led to the creation of democratic societies that value individual rights and freedoms above all else. And it is understandable why this desire for unrestricted freedom and privacy is an essential part of any functioning democracy, as it is an undeniable part of what makes us human, and an undeniably important buffer against the advances of despotic regimes that would seek to control our lives.\nUltimately, while the current debate in societies across the world will continue to rage, it is essential to remember what is at stake when we discuss individual privacy. It is the very essence of our right to live as we please, free from external and internal constraints, and to maintain democracy. While the need for greater security and the desire for surveillance is also important, it must be done within the boundaries of individual freedom. Society can have both individual privacy and security but only if the rule of law and due processis strictly observed in regulating these two ideals. It is a difficult balancing act but it is not impossible, but it is important that we do not sacrifice the very essence of our being for the illusion of complete security.",
                "remembered forever\" as depicted in the movie \"Braveheart\". This understanding is also what prompted the United Nations to adopt Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which specifies that \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation\". Therefore, the protection of individual privacy is worth protecting as it enables people to live according to their own wishes, free from external control, and thus contribute to their own happiness and welfare.\nHowever, it must also be noted that the protection of privacy cannot simply be taken as an absolute value, as it is sometimes necessary to limit it in order to maintain social order and safety for all. For instance, with the rise of terrorism, it is sometimes necessary for governments to implement surveillance measures in order to detect and prevent possible attacks. In such cases, the protection of privacy must be balanced with the need for the safety of the general public. Likewise, in cases of criminal investigations, the need for justice and protection of victims may require intrusions on individual privacy. Therefore, while the protection of privacy is of utmost importance, it must be balanced against the needs of society as a whole in certain situations.\nIn conclusion, the protection of privacy is valuable in terms of upholding individual freedoms and welfare, and preventing the descent of democracies into police states where individual rights are sacrificed in the name of safety. However, this protection should not be taken as an absolute value, and must be balanced against the needs of society as a whole in specific situations. Ultimately, the goal should be to find a balance between privacy protection and necessary intrusions on it in order to ensure the safety and welfare of all.",
                "remembered forever, and continued to inspire Scottish nationalism centuries later\".\nHowever, we must also consider the potential risks and downsides of the protection of privacy. While fuelling free expression and free will, the protection of privacy also has an unfortunate side effect of aiding potential terrorists, criminals and other radical groups. There is always the possibility that such groups might misuse the protection of privacy to evade law enforcement agencies' dragnets and orchestrate their attacks with impunity, knowing that their communication or movements are safe from being detected. This could lead to more terror attacks, increased violence and crime and, ultimately, loss of life. In addition, the rise and proliferation of new technologies have further complicated the issue since criminals and terrorists can now communicate with each other and plan attacks using even more sophisticated methods such as encrypted messaging systems. Hence, governments need to balance the rights to privacy against the need of national security, and there might be situations where certain aspects of privacy may have to be temporarily sacrificed in order to ensure public safety.\nIn conclusion, while the protection of privacy is essential for individual freedom and happiness, governments must balance individual privacy and national security. The protection of privacy is worthwhile, but not at the expense of everyone'ssecurity. As technology advances, it is becoming increasingly challenging to strike a balance between privacy and national security, and governments must continue to adapt their approach in order to ensure the continued safety and welfare of their people.",
                "remembered, and inspired the movie Braveheart\".\nOn the other side of the argument, it can be said that ensuring the protection of privacy unduly hinders the ability of the government and law enforcement agencies to carry out their duties of protecting citizens from harm, especially in the age where terrorist attacks are increasing in frequency, brutality and unpredictability. The growth of social media has led to the ability of extremists to disseminate their ideologies and teachings across the globe, with a corresponding increase in the number of terrorist attacks carried out across Europe in particular. This means that monitoring activities and communications is essential for the safety and security of the general public. Law enforcement agencies have pointed out that terrorists often use encrypted messaging systems to communicate with one another, making it difficult for authorities to monitor suspicious activities and prevent horrific acts of terror, which threatens the general public with grievous harm.  \nAt the end of the day, it is all about finding a middle ground between the two sides of the argument. Governments must be able to strike a balance between protecting the privacy rights of individuals as well as ensuring the safety and welfare of the general public. This can be achieved through the creation of legal frameworks that recognize the importance of privacy rights while at the same time allowing for intelligence agencies and law enforcement agencies to do their work and protect their citizens from harm. We must seek a solution that does not compromise individual privacy or at the same time compromise the security of the state.  Overall, it is clear that the protection of privacy is definitely worthwhile as it preserves precious individual rights and freedoms, and is an essential democratic principle in any functioning society.",
                "Remembered as a symbol of Scottish freedom\" as depicted in the famous movie \"Braveheart\". This goes to show that personal freedoms and privacy are deeply valued by individuals and are worth protecting.\nHowever, it is also essential to consider that while privacy rights are fundamental, there are circumstances where these rights will need to be restricted in order to protect the safety and welfare of others. For instance, when a terrorist act is on the verge of being committed, it is crucial for the government or relevant authorities to have the capacity to monitor activities, track locations and intercept communications. This is especially important nowadays with the increasing use of social media platforms as a tool for terrorists and criminals to communicate and plan their acts. In such situations, the need for personal privacy takes second place to the need to prevent catastrophic events from happening and safeguarding the larger community. The balance between the protection of privacy and the need to keep the society safe is, therefore, a complex issue, but we should strive to ensure that any effort to protect the society does not go beyond reasonable measures and does not curtail individual rights and freedoms.\nIn conclusion, individual privacy is a fundamental right that cannot, and should not, be taken away lightly. The right to privacy forms the bedrock of individual freedoms and is essential to people'shappiness and well-being. While there are situations where privacy needs to be restricted in order to maintain national security and protect others, this must be done within reasonable bounds and should not lead to the erosion of individual freedoms that are essential to ensuring a just and democratic society.

In this digital age, our personal information is often put online, leaving it vulnerable to cyberattacks and hacking. Furthermore, terrorists and criminals have also historically used the anonymity provided by the internet to plan their attacks, with some even radicalising individuals through the use of targeted online propaganda. As such, there needs to be a balance between protecting privacy and ensuring that the state has the capability to prevent and combat terrorism, violence and crime.\nIn conclusion, the protection of privacy is worthwhile but not at all costs. Privacy is fundamental to the preservation of individual freedoms, and is a necessary precondition for happiness and fulfilment. However, with the threat of terrorism, violence and crime present in modern society, there needs to be a balance between privacy and national security. Governments must seek to strike this balance by using targeted approaches to monitor potential threats, rather than blanket surveillance of everyone's personal lives. Ultimately, the protection of privacy should not be completely discarded in the name of national security, as this would eventually lead to the erosion of democracy and the infringement of the rights of individuals to make their own choices in life."

It has allowed us to celebrate a time of unprecedented advancement in our healthcare systems and practices and drastically improved our quality of life in ways which would have been simply unimaginable otherwise.\nHowever, despite its benefit to the global economy, greater diversity can undermine the economic wellbeing of individuals within countries. Greater diversity in the economy often leads to countries and corporations valuing specialist and cheap foreign talent more than the talent within their borders. This can be seen in places such as Hong Kong, where the expatriate population is around four percent of the entire population of Hong Kong, creating a higher level of competition in the workforce for the local population than they had previously experienced. This is also seen in Singapore, which depends predominantly on foreign workers to meet its manpower needs in the construction, retail and food and beverage industries. With countries more willing to look at a diverse array of cultures for talent, locals in these countries and cities have begun to feel increased levels of competition throughout all levels of  the workforce as only the best and brightest can compete with the foreign experts at the top of their fields for jobs, while the competition for lower income jobs rises due to the increased number of individuals flooding to more developed economies to look for job opportunities. This struggle for employment however, has a greater effect on the poorer sections of the population as they may lack the skills to adapt and improve their skills to stay competitive, leading to the eventual rise in the income gap as the inflow of cheaper foreign talent for menial jobs causes greater problems for the poor than the introduction of foreign expats to the economy as these industry professionals have the means and ability to adapt and maintain their competitiveness in the job market. These fears underpin the rise of populist governments like that led by Donald J.

Thus, the benefits associated with a more diverse workforce, such as lower cost of labour and increasing quality of work,  should not be taken at face value especially since these measures implemented without proper regulations in place may lead to the widening of the income gap and other dire consequences for the country such as social instability.\nIncreased diversity and ease of movement could also make it harder for countries to develop due to the brain drain phenomenon, where talent in developing nations are more willing to venture overseas due to the diverse nature of the workforce in most first world countries. Local talent in developing nations will start looking to work overseas rather than staying locally as it would give them the opportunity to work in better environments and with better benefits due to the structural foundations that have already been laid overseas as opposed to in their homes. Furthermore, the diverse nature of local workforces also encourages them to move abroad as they feel more comfortable to peruse overseas opportunities with less of a fear of falling homesick. This has been happening for years in countries such as India where most of its top scientists and engineers move to developed nations such as America in pursuit of work, draining the country of a large number of its top intellectuals who could have been working in the country to help it progress. Out of 2.96 million foreign-born scientists based in Asia, Indian nationals number about 950,000, suggesting the extent of brain drain that India has to contend with. Uganda, too, has recently plunged into a healthcare crisis as more than 2000 highly trained medical professionals have chosen to leave for greener pastures in the Middle East. The loss of these top intellectuals to foreign governments and companies sets back developing nations by taking away the people that would have been their pioneers and leaders which would lead the country to a new dawn in terms of technological and economic growth, preventing these developing nations from steadily growing and improving into first world developed nations themselves. Thus, diversity, despite its benefit to the global economy, has left many countries without the means of developing as their top talents are more willing to leave the countries for greener pastures due to the increased job security and comfort that the acceptance of diversity has created for foreigners in the global economy.\nOverall, diversity has with it both positive and negative effects on the world as a whole. However, it is undeniable that with diversity, some will continue to fear it and the influence it has on the world. Despite this, with proper regulations to mitigate the negative effects that diversity brings with it, the benefits that diversity has on international cooperation, the global economy and healthcare and wellness alone should be enough to convince the world that it is something that should be celebrated and not feared.",

With the world continuing to progress, it has in fact created a more conducive and comfortable environment for its different heritages to grow and prosper by giving these heritages a new voice through the avenue of technology and social media.\nThe progress of society has also led to different communities across the world becoming more accepting of different groups and their cultural heritage. The progress that society has made towards the acceptance of different cultures has allowed them to thrive even beyond their original borders. Increased education and the message of acceptance that has been spread across the world as a result of globalisation and the ease of exchange of information and movement has witnessed cultures and heritage thrive in completely foreign lands as many of these heritages and traditions are brought along with their people as they move across the increasingly connected world. One prime example of this would be the rise of Chinatowns within major cities across the world, acting as a shining beacon of Chinese cultural heritage amidst a cosmopolitan backdrop in cities like Melbourne, New York and London \u2013 miles away from China itself. Indian food joints have similarly become ubiquitous in Western cities like London. Apart from being a place for people to maintain their cultural heritage abroad, these areas have become a way for foreigners to acquaint themselves with the cultural heritage of a place and community within the comforts of their own country. The prominence of different cultural experiences and images across the world has thus created a more inclusive and accepting world, creating a more comfortable and inviting environment for people to express and maintain their cultural heritage.\nHowever, there are often times when the preservation of heritage conflicts with and obstructs progress, preventing communities from improving due to their loyalty to heritage. The road to progress can often be destructive, with people having to sacrifice in order to advance. Oftentimes, progress can only be achieved if we are willing to give up our traditions and heritage as the resources that are important to these traditions are needed for the future. This struggle between heritage and progress can be seen in Singapore as the country continues to struggle with the issue of land scarcity while attempting to maintain the heritage of the country through the preservation of small, old buildings such as shophouses, which if allowed to be torn down to make way for new developments, could go a long way to solving the land scarcity issue. European cities like Prague, Krakow and Budapest often struggle to incorporate future urban development while preserving historical architecture, resulting in intricate and complex urban planning patterns centred around relics of the past. The nostalgia that many communities feel towards places and objects of their heritage can often cloud their judgement when it comes to the bigger goal of the community as they are unwilling to sacrifice their heritage to solve their modern problems. Thus, heritage often comes into direct conflict with progress as the only way to allow the world to continue to progress is sometimes to let go of our heritage and let progress take its place.\nOverall, as society progresses, so does the way heritage is viewed and manged by those in society. Progress has allowed heritage and traditions to enter a period of renaissance where they are more readily visible and accepted than ever before. Although heritage often does come into conflict with progress in certain areas, the progress that society has made has created avenues to work around these inconveniences and allowed the heritage of different societies across the world to become more global and more secure. Many would assume that as society progresses, there will be no place left for heritage in society, however, the opposite is in fact true: as society progresses ,it creates more opportunities for heritage to be preserved, spread and accepted in our modern and progressive community.",

Furthermore, as society progresses, there is also room for innovation and fusion, whereby new cultural practices are created by fusing old practices with modern-day thinking and technology. Examples of this include the use of traditional music to create new techno music, or the blend of traditional clothing with contemporary designs to create fashionable pieces. The continued growth and progress of society may not therefore lead to the decline of heritage and traditions but, in fact, could create new opportunities for heritage to thrive.\nIn conclusion, the notion that as society progresses, there will be no place for heritage is undoubtedly pessimistic. Instead, it has been shown that technological advancements and the growth of society have created new opportunities for heritage to be preserved and showcased. In addition, the increased cultural knowledge of people worldwide has allowed for awareness and appreciation of heritage from different communities. Therefore, we need to recognise the new opportunities that progress creates to promote and preserve our heritage, as it represents the rich and unique histories of our cultures, and an important means of connecting with our past.",

The rise in technological advancements and the increasing reach of digital platforms provide us with new tools to preserve and spread knowledge about our global heritage and tradition. With the help of these developments, the world's progress can work hand in hand with the preservation of our heritage and traditions. This ensures that we don't have to leave behind the aspects of our past that are important to us and that we can continue to pass on the richness and beauty of our heritage to future generations.",

An example of this is the fading music traditions of Syria. War and heightened feelings of nationalism have led to the decline of the traditional Syrian musical heritage as it is increasingly being pushed aside in favour of newer music forms. There is a real fear that the unique artistic expression of the Syrians may eventually be lost and forgotten, leaving a void in the rich and vibrant tapestry that the Syrian culture is. Therefore, it is important that while we embrace the progress that society brings, we must also find ways to balance this with the preservation of the heritage and traditions that make our society unique. This could mean finding creative ways to integrate tradition into everyday life or promoting heritage education in schools to ensure that cultural knowledge is passed down to future generations.\n\nIn conclusion, the progress that society has made need not be a reason for the loss of heritage and tradition. Instead, the advancement of technology and the increased connectivity that the world now enjoys presents us with new opportunities for the preservation of our cultures and traditional practices. We must be mindful of the potential threat to our heritage and traditions and strive to maintain their relevance in modern society.

The busy and fast-paced society that we live in today may make it challenging for younger generations to fully embrace their cultural heritage. The overwhelming presence of popular culture in media and entertainment may make younger generations more prone to be influenced by outside cultures rather than their own. However, it is up to society as a whole to actively ensure that heritage is preserved and valued. This can be done by creating community programmes and educational initiatives to expose young people to their heritage. As stakeholders, the older generation should find ways to create an intergenerational transfer of knowledge and heritage to ensure its continuity, securing the survival of heritage traditions that have withstood the test of time.\nIn conclusion, progress has undoubtedly changed and will continue to change society in the years to come. However, heritage does have a place in modern society, and progress can even be utilised to better preserve traditions.

In fact, the two can seamlessly coexist as seen through the modern day fusion of traditional and contemporary music. This fusion approach has allowed for traditional music to be entrenched within the modern music scene, giving it even more relevance within society. In South Korea, trot music, a genre of traditional Korean music, has been fused with elements of pop music to create new and exciting music that appeals to the younger generation. Similarly, Singapore's traditional Chinese opera has been given a modern twist with contemporary elements such as popular music and multimedia art installations being integrated into the shows. By adopting a fusion approach, societies have been able to create contemporary culture while still honouring and preserving traditional heritage.\nIn conclusion, society's progress should not and does not mean that there is no place for heritage. In fact, societal progress has actually allowed for the increasing preservation of heritage and traditions, greater awareness of the importance of heritage, and an opportunity for heritage to be revitalised and integrated into modern culture.

As a result, society has been able to progress while simultaneously keeping the traditions and customs of different cultures alive, allowing the world's heritage to coexist with the world's progress.\nThat being said, there are still challenges in preserving heritage and traditions in the face of technological progress. One such challenge is the changing lifestyles of society as progress can lead to the erosion of traditional practises and customs. With the rise of digital technology and social media platforms, the adoption of modern lifestyles and beliefs has become increasingly widespread, resulting in the decline of certain traditional practises. This trend can be seen in the practice of traditional crafts, such as the making of batik fabrics in Indonesia, which is slowly dying out due to a lack of interest and the availability of cheaper, mass-produced alternatives. Therefore, while progress can allow society's past to be preserved and celebrated, it can also result in certain traditional practices fading away, which can lead to a loss of cultural identity and heritage.\nIn conclusion, it is evident that society's progress and heritage can coexist, and with the continued growth of technology, the preservation of heritage has become more accessible. However, society needs to be mindful of balancing progress with cultural preservation to ensure the longevity of the world's heritage. By doing so, society can continue to progress while ensuring that its past remains alive and vibrant so that future generations can learn and benefit from the wisdom of those who came before us."

            "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE THAT SCIENCE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RELIGION?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "is for us to better understand the natural world. Religious texts and their description of events are of great help to scientists hypothesising and corroborating theories about the world, such as how the theory about the Big Bang, a theory about how the universe came into existence, existed in some form within Christian religious texts for centuries. Nonetheless, the importance of the sciences to the progress of the human race is unquestionable: an understanding of the world through science is essential in allowing us to continue to grow and innovate for the future and not get held back by the artificial limitations imposed by religion.\nHowever, when we examine this debate from a different angle, it cannot be denied that religion is more important than science from a moral perspective as religion lays many of the moral foundations which govern the way human beings act. Much of what people understand as right and wrong has developed over the years due to religious influences, with many societies directly classifying actions as good or bad due to how their gods or their sacred scriptures would view these acts. For example, it is widely known that in many religions that act of murder is a sin and the Christian Bible even goes so far as to tell its followers to \"love thy neighbour as thyself\", demonstrating how religion often holds people to a higher moral code and reinforcing that notions of right and wrong come naturally to most. Legal traditions, which often draw inspiration from conventional moral standards, have been influenced by religion at some point or the other. In Thailand, Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion have been flawlessly integrated with modern concepts of public administration and legal process, introducing a framework for both religious discourse and legal authority. That said, it should be noted that religion may not be perfect in this aspect \u2013 religion is often used to justify acts of bigotry such as homophobia, as the Westboro Baptist Church suggests. Despite its flaws, religion does serve as a guide in many ways to how people should act, as all religions do tend to promote good behaviour and practises and reinforce strong moral character. Science on the other hand intrinsically lacks emotion and any moral compass as science is in essence entirely based on facts and outcomes. While religion alone does not make up the moral code of all humans, it does however form the moral foundations that many in the world choose to adhere to, demonstrating its important place in maintaining the moral compass of many across the world, and indeed even for those who have dedicated their lives to science.\nReligion is also more important and effective than science when it comes to bringing people together and forming bonds within the community. Religion gives people a common belief system that unites people, allowing people to come together to share their struggles and beliefs within their common faiths. Religion often forms the basis of many communities being one of the only things that can bring together people from different walks of life and even different parts of the world together, uniting people in a way that not much else can. The Hajj in the Islamic faith for example is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest site in the world for Muslims and a mandatory religious duty that gathers Muslims from around the world to worship and practise their religion. On a smaller scale, communities anchored by churches tend to rally when one of their own is in need of aid, and this is evidenced by church-run programmes like soup kitchens or donation drives. Research conducted by the Religion News Service suggests that religious people are three to four times more likely than non-religious people to engage in civic activism, be it volunteering their time with grassroot organisations, donating to social causes or engaging with their community. This uniting of people from a vast array of different countries and backgrounds based on their common beliefs and faith, demonstrates the unifying ability that religion can have on individuals as it allows them to bond and see pass their differences because of their common faith. Despite science being something that is used by all humans, the scientific method emphasises the use of logic and objectivity, and therefore its proponents may lack any spiritual connection due to its cold and clinical nature. It can be summarised as a discipline that is used by all but only understood by an advanced few due to the complex nature of science. Furthermore, although science has allowed people across the globe to interact more and understand each other'scultures through technology, much of these interactions and understandings happen at face value and do not evoke the same strength of community which is achieved through the spiritual connections that religion creates. Moreover, technology provides a means of increasing social isolation instead. The Stanford University for the Quantitative Study of Society noted a correlation between spending a significant amount of time on the Internet and people spending less time interacting with their families. Thus, the importance of religion in uniting people is unrivalled, with the efforts of science and scientific advancements paling in comparison to those of religion due to the emotional and spiritual nature of religion, allowing it to bring people together for a higher power and something greater than themselves.\nOverall, science holds a predominant role in underpinning our understanding of the physical world, with the majority of the tools we use to work, commute, and survive being a direct result of scientific innovations. However, religion is unique and unrivalled in its contribution to society'smoral, emotional and spiritual development through its ability to hold individuals to a higher moral standing and bind them through their religious beliefs in a way that nothing else can. Thus, while science is more important in terms of directly leading to the scientifically and technologically efficient world we have today, without religion, the world would lack unity and meaning, creating a society that is unable to tell from right and wrong and unable to create and innovate for the good and progress of humanity.",
            "machine_gen_truncate": " evidence and data.\n\nFurthermore, science is continually changing, discovering, and improving our understanding of the world. The knowledge we have today is not the same as the knowledge we had a hundred years ago, and the same will be a hundred years from now. Science is self-correcting and is open to new ideas and alternate theories. Research and experiments conducted in science are reviewed by peers, which ensures that scientific claims are reliable and grounded in and accurate evidence. Owing to this nature of science, its reliability is unquestionable and its credibility never tarnished due to conflict and differences of opinions. Religious beliefs, on the other hand, have a fixed set of rules and traditions that should not be challenged or altered. This resistance to change makes religious beliefs less adaptable to the current changes of knowledge.\n\nLastly, Science is an inclusive practice that acknowledges and embraces diversity of thought rather than an exclusive religious practice. Religion demands us to believe in one particular God or deity and this makes it exclusive of other religions. It creates a fundamental divide. People who subscribe to different religions have different beliefs, practices, and worship different gods, which can lead to conflicts between groups. Science, however, is inclusive and allows for diversity of thought. Scientific discoveries are based on empirical data and evidence, and can be understood by individuals of different cultural backgrounds, religions, and beliefs. Science welcomes everyone irrespective of their beliefs and ethnicity. \n\nIn conclusion, Science and religion both play vital roles in the world, and people's lives, but when it comes to making decisions based on evidence, science is more important than religion. Science has the power to change and transform the world; its objective nature, self-correction, and inclusiveness make it a vital player in the world. While religion offers moral guidance and a sense of belonging, it cannot replace science in providing logical and rational explanations for the natural world.

They have been passed down from generation to generation and have had a great influence on the way people treat one another, creating the ideal of equality, treating others with respect, and embracing diversity. Further, it can be argued that religion provides a sense of hope and comfort to individuals, especially in times of grief and despair. For example, the belief in an afterlife can provide solace for people who have lost loved ones, and prayer can offer a sense of calmness despite troubling circumstances. Religion also has a strong role in promoting social cohesion and community building, and has helped build up societies, networks, and infrastructure throughout history.\n\nIn conclusion, while the debate over whether science or religion is more important to the world is a long and complicated one, it can be argued that science holds greater importance in terms of its direct impact on physical health, modern living, and shaping our perception and understanding of the physical world around us. However, it is also important to acknowledge the significance of religion in providing moral and ethical values, offering comfort and hope to individuals, and supporting community building.

While religion cannot be completely cast aside in terms of its role in providing moral guidance, the overwhelming benefits that science has bestowed upon society in terms of advancements in technology and healthcare, as well as a greater understanding of the world around us, has shifted the scales clearly in favor of science being more important than religion in modern life.",

Thus, science holds significance in our understanding and shaping of the world, away from religious views and towards rational, scientifically-backed beliefs. \n\nIn conclusion, science has a greater importance in today's world as compared to religion. This is due to the numerous contributions of science to society, the dominance of technology in modern life, and the deeper understanding of the world that science offers.

For instance, most religions speak of a basic human compassion, which guides their followers to help those in need. This has been instrumental in many charity works and programs undertaken by religious bodies across the world which function as vital support systems especially for the poor. Moreover, certain religious groups have spearheaded movements for social justice, seeking to better the situation of the oppressed, advocating reforms, and fighting for the rights of groups otherwise ignored by the vast majority. Thus, while science gives humanity the knowledge and resources to keep pushing forward, religion provides a guiding moral compass for how people ought to live their lives, providing the essential much-needed moral and ethical underpinnings to life which science may not necessarily be equipped to do on its own.\nIn conclusion, while both science and religion are of essential importance, science is arguably more valuable than religion due to its profound effects on humanity's survival and progress. Science has been pivotal in reducing mortality rates, improving general health, and boosting the overall quality of life among people across the globe. Moreover, its ability to develop innovations that radically change the way people live their lives often means it has a significant impact on the societal mindset and worldview, influencing even religious beliefs.Christianity, Judaism, Islam, and all other religions attain meaning and compromise to the scientific understanding of the world in different ways, some more harmoniously than others, primarily driving humanity's moral and ethical precepts in conjunction with science's material advances. Thus, science and religion are both necessary forces in reconciling the existential and practical needs of humanity and should be seen more in their complementary capacities, rather than being compared in a competition over their respective values.",

Therefore, religion should not be discounted as unimportant, as it can serve an important function in shaping our lives for the better.\n\nIn conclusion, while science has undeniably provided us with an immense wealth of knowledge, groundbreaking medical advances and a deeper understanding of the world around us, this does not mean that religion is less important. The two have vastly different functions and purposes in society, with science serving to improve our physical wellbeing, while religion provides us with a set of moral values and beliefs that can help guide us in our lives.

The scientific community is working tirelessly in order to find and implement solutions to these issues, some of which require long-term planning and sustained effort, avoiding short-sighted goals that we may have as human beings. As such, science plays an important role in shaping the world for a better future for all.\nIn conclusion, while religion plays a significant role in the lives of many individuals and communities globally, it is clear that science is, in our current world, more important in terms of its physical, social and intellectual impact. This not only covers the way it has improved healthcare policies and promoted general wellbeing, but also how society as a whole depends on it for its survival and progress. Religion will still continue to play an essential and respected role in the lives of millions, but there is little doubt that science will continue to reign in terms of its practicality and impact.",

Religious teachings have allowed for the development of a shared set of values and beliefs that drive moral and ethical behavior such as the value of kindness, love, and compassion - values that are essential in a harmonious and peaceful society. In this sense, religion may hold a certain level of importance that cannot be discounted as it provides a sense of comfort, community and provides guidance on what is right and wrong for the individual. In a world where increasing individuals are struggling with mental health issues, religion can provide a much-needed solace in helping individuals cope with these issues. It can provide them with a sense of purpose, hope and comfort that science may not be able to offer, but again, this is an emotional benefit that does not provide any definitive or tangible impact on the world the way that science does. \n\nIn conclusion, it can be seen that while religion may hold a certain level of importance for individuals in terms of comfort and guidance in moral values and beliefs, it cannot be denied that science as a field offers significantly more tangible and definitive benefits, particularly in the areas of healthcare, technology and understanding of the world around us. As such, it seems that science is more important than religion in shaping the world around us and making our lives better and more prosperous. However, it is important to note that both science and religion have their inherent benefits and setbacks, and it is the recognition of this that will allow society to better build a harmonious, cohesive and improved future.",

Conversely, science does not dictate moral values or lay a moral foundation for how we should live, which can be seen as a possible drawback in terms of importance. Nonetheless, science is still essential in bringing about profound change in society and contributing to the overall betterment of the world.\n\nIn conclusion, while religion may still hold a valuable place in society, science is irrefutably more important in terms of tangible benefits to humankind, utility in modern day-to-day life, and its contribution to a deeper understanding of the physical world around us. Nonetheless, this does not necessarily indicate that religion is entirely irrelevant to society, as the moral code that religion provides serves as a crucial component of a functioning society.

In a world that is propelled by profit and scientific progress, religion has the ability to humanise the way people behave towards one another, often asking people to take responsibility for their actions and think about their impact on society as a whole. Religion can therefore act as a counter-balance to scientific progress, acting as a reminder that while the world may be moving ahead rapidly, the impact of these actions should always be considered before making any decisions. Religious values and teachings can encourage individuals to act with kindness, compassion, and empathy towards others, even when scientific advancement may tell them to do otherwise. \n\nIn conclusion, while science has undoubtedly made tremendous contributions to the betterment of society, it is important to note that religion also plays an integral role in shaping the way that individuals perceive and interact with the world around them. Rather than viewing these two as inherently at odds with one another, it is important to recognise the unique strengths and benefits that both science and religion bring to our daily lives and strive to find a balance between the two in our pursuit of a more just and equitable world."

It emphasizes skepticism, experimentation, and analysis, and promotes open-mindedness and humility in the face of the unknown. In contrast, religion is based on faith, where people often are taught or encouraged not to question the beliefs that are being taught to them. While religion has led to great cultural, spiritual and social enrichment, it has often been the source of conflicts and extremism. Science, on the other hand, promotes a rational approach to problem-solving, and its discoveries are open to scrutiny and verification, which helps us correct our mistakes. In a world where spurious and fake information proliferates online, prioritizing a discipline that continuously refines its methods to achieve trustworthy, factual conclusions appears more valuable.\n\nIn conclusion, while religion and science both play significant roles in our lives, science is more important because of its transformative power, objectivity, and emphasis on critical thinking. It has helped us to solve complex problems and enables us to lead comfortable and convenient lives. Science is responsible for developments like vaccines, transportation, and communication. It has a significant cultural and economic impact and has empowered us to discover new dimensions of the universe. Science has its limitations and boundaries as it cannot answer some philosophical or metaphysical questions, but it plays an indispensable role in ensuring our physical, mental, and societal well-being. Hence, science undoubtedly deserves superiority in priority concerning its highly pragmatic and effective contributions towards human progress.",

One of the most important aspects of science is that it teaches people to question, analyze and test every concept, idea or theory. This process of questioning and testing helps develop critical thinking skills, which are essential in modern-day society. Religion, on the other hand, tends to promote conformity and obedience to a particular set of beliefs and values. While conformity can be seen as a positive thing, it can also be a barrier to progress and hold people back from exploring new ideas and concepts.\n\nIn conclusion, both science and religion are important in society.

Religion has been the cause of many wars and conflicts throughout history, leading to loss of life and destruction. Science, on the other hand, promotes peace, diversity and has the potential to unite people through the sharing of knowledge and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while religion has an important role in society, science is more important in shaping the world and bringing about positive change. Science is objective, inclusive, and has led to greater progress and development, while religion is based on faith and moral beliefs, which can be subjective and exclusive.

            "human_gen_truncate": "d negative consequences do arise. As society strives to enhance its technological prowess and overall standard of living, the changes that have been made to the way of life on the planet has resulted in the creation of modern problems. Anthropogenic climate change, for instance, is a direct result of the Industrial Revolution, which saw the proliferation of technologies such as the coal-dependent steam engine as humans sought to improve their quality of life. The changes that have occurred in the way that trade, transport and business are conducted have led to consequences such as the increase in air travel and the food we consume. These in turn have led to tremendous amounts of burning and deforestation in order to keep up with the need for energy. As a result, the amount of greenhouse gases has increased tremendously over the past 150 years, and close to 1.3 million square metres of forest cover have been destroyed since 1990. The blind pursuit of change and innovation, motivated by our obsession with improvement of quality of life, has led the human race to a time where the very existence of the entire human race is now under threat. It is often quipped that \"the road to hell is often paved with good intentions\", and indeed, while many desire change with altruistic motivations in mind, we must be mindful that these good intentions can and do sometimes lead to detrimental consequences for society in the long term.\nFurthermore, change can be detrimental if communities are unable to adapt to these changes, or if the effects of these changes are not appropriately managed. Many communities around the world have deep-rooted traditions steeped in history. Some of these traditions have directed the way these communities live their lives, with many being traditionally subsistence-based in nature. The focus on subsistence has caused many of these native and traditional communities to be unable to adapt to the changes that the world has undergone over the years, as they lack the education and the capital to entirely rework the nature of their societies and align it to the way that the modern world is structured. The Native American communities for example have struggled for years in the United States as their traditional subsistence-based nature and their deep-rooted connections to their lands have limited their ability to adapt to the nature of work and commerce in the 21stcentury. Without the tradition of working for monetary gain and the structures for a proper education system, these communities have often been left behind, swamped by drastic and rapid change, resulting in many of these communities having to struggle in order to survive in the modern economy. The change that the world experienced was therefore detrimental to these communities and their way of life as they did not have the conditions and structures needed to allow them to adapt in the modern world, leaving them vulnerable to the winds of change in the social, economic and technological domains. Besides traditional values, certain marginalized communities such as the poor bear the brunt of the negative repercussions of change due to their conditions and situations they find themselves in. The poor and uneducated sometimes find it challenging to pick up new skills and adapt to new technologies in a world that evolves at breakneck pace, where industries are constantly being disrupted and cheap foreign labour depresses their wages. Taxi drivers in Malaysia have protested against technological companies like Grab and Uber for threatening their livelihood, for instance, and they do not have any recourse against such obtrusive change. Thus, change can sometimes be undesirable as different communities adapt and come to terms with change at different paces, leaving many communities to suffer as the world speeds towards the future.\nOverall, to assert that change is always good would be an overgeneralisation of the nature of change and its many facets, while ignoring the detrimental effects that change can bring if it is not properly managed. Although change does have its benefits, these do come with their own sets of challenges which could in fact be worse than what we had experienced before. Ultimately, change is neither inherently bad nor innately good and a lot depends on how change is managed and how it is received by different groups within society.",

For instance, changes in natural environments can lead to climate change, which poses a threat to human survival. Changes in social and cultural norms can also generate negative effects, such as the breakdown of family values and institutions. In some cases, changes can also lead to conflict, violence, and war. The world has seen significant upheavals and tragedies brought about by changes in political leadership, religious beliefs, and social identities. The Holocaust, Rwanda genocide, and the current Syrian crisis are examples of negative change that has led to millions of deaths and suffering.\n\nMoreover, changes motivated by greed, selfishness, or malicious intent can result in negative outcomes. Corrupt leadership, unethical practices, and illicit activities have been known to perpetuate injustice, inequality, and poverty. Changes that benefit a few at the expense of the majority are morally reprehensible and detrimental to society.\n\nIn conclusion, change is a mixed bag, and its impact depends on various factors. While some changes can promote progress, equality, and growth, others can lead to destruction and suffering. Therefore, it is essential to assess the nature, motivation, and outcomes of change before embracing it. If change is guided by noble goals, transparency, and accountability, it can lead to positive outcomes that benefit society as a whole. Conversely, if change is driven by selfish interests, greed, or malicious intent, it will result in negative consequences that harm society.

For instance, technological progress may prompt the adoption of new technologies to replace older ones, which could lead to the loss of jobs or even result in entire industries being wiped out. In addition, the adoption of new technologies may lead to overdependence on them, which may eventually limit the scope of human thought and creativity, making us more like machines than humans. Furthermore, change can have a particularly negative effect on the environment, where energy-intensive innovations and urbanisation may lead to greenhouse gas emissions and deforestation, provoking biodiversity loss and global warminf that may contribute to climate change. These developments have brought about a trend of making changes in a sustainable manner that is considerate of the environment and society. Thus, it is essential for people planning to unroll changes to assess the risks and benefits of such policies in great detail.\nTo conclude, change is not always good, as it can either be good or bad, depending on the effects it has and the context in which it occurs. While change is mostly considered a positive force, an absolute view of change as being wholly beneficial is inadequate. The downsides of change need to be recognised, and risks need to be assessed before making changes to realise the benefits of change and minimise the negative effects it may cause. Therefore, people need to be open-minded when deciding which changes to implement, putting in place policies that can maximise benefits for society while minimising harm. By doing this, we can ensure that change always yields the best possible outcomes for our world.",

For instance, when a company introduces a new technology to improve efficiency or to streamline operations, it could lead to the displacement of workers and a loss of jobs. Similarly, the large-scale adoption of electric cars could lead to the depletion of rare earth metals and the creation of e-waste that damages the environment. In these cases, the good of change is overshadowed by the negative consequences that result from it.\nFurthermore, the pace of change can also be too rapid to adapt to, resulting in societal upheaval and negative impacts. When communities experience rapid change, they may face unexpected and tremendous challenges that they are unable to adapt to quickly enough. This can result in the breakdown of social fabric and trust between individuals, leading to schisms within communities. In extreme cases, it can result in violent conflict, such as what is happening in Myanmar and Mali where ethnic tensions have spilled over and resulted in violence. It is in these cases that the negative effects of change far outweigh any potential benefits that could have resulted from the change. Hence, change cannot be always good, and we have to be aware of its potential risks and downsides.\nIn conclusion, while change is generally viewed as a force for good and an essential aspect of life, we must be aware of its potential risks and downsides that may result in unintended consequences. It is essential to consider both the immediate and long-term implications of change, in order to understand how it can be leveraged effectively to help us achieve our collective goals and ambitions.

This may lead to ecological and environmental damage, disrupting natural habitats and leading to soil erosion, which could have negative long-term consequences on people's livelihoods and survival. Similarly, in the race to come up with technological advancements and solutions to complex problems, there is always the possibility that people may overlook important ethical considerations that could have severe impacts on society. For instance, the invention and commercialisation of vaping were touted as a major milestone in the fight against tobacco smoking, when in reality its long-term effects on users and non-users remain unclear. Hence, we must be aware of the risks and downsides that come with change as these can be harmful and detrimental to society. \n\nIn conclusion, while change is generally positive and necessary for progress, it is not always the case that change is an absolute force for good. To advocate solely that change is good is to ignore the complexities and nuances of how change affects people's lives and the environment.

Only then can we ensure that we are introducing change that can genuinely improve the world and drive progress.",
                "d negative consequences may emerge and catch society off guard. This is because change can destabilise existing systems and structures that are rooted in society, leading to uncertainty and anxiety among those affected by the change. For example, the advent of the Industrial Revolution, while a boon to humanity, led to mass unemployment and the disruption of existing social and economic orders. Furthermore, the rapid pace of technological change that we see today has led to concerns over data privacy and the growing threat of automation to traditional jobs. Additionally, the pursuit of change may also bring about a loss of tradition, history and culture that were once revered by society. While progress may seem like a good thing, we must bear in mind that some things are worth preserving and that the sweeping tide of change must be assessed to see whether it will bring a net benefit to society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, while change is largely positive and needed to advance society in a variety of ways, it is not always good. Change can be a double-edged sword whereby its effects can be difficult to predict. As such, we must assess the merits of change on a case-by-case basis and ensure that we fully understand the intended and unintended effects of the proposed change. Ultimately, the pursuit of change must be balanced against the preservation of tradition, culture and societal stability in order for it to be truly beneficial for society.",
                "d negative consequences are overlooked and may eventually prove to be detrimental. For example, the use of fossil fuels in the Industrial Revolution allowed for unprecedented economic growth and industrialisation, but this rapid exploitation of resources has led to the anthropogenic climate change that we face today. Another example would be the increased connectivity that technology has brought about. While it has been beneficial in terms of facilitating communication and providing easier access to information, it has also led to the erosion of personal privacy, as data is being tracked constantly and at an unprecedented scale. Hence, it is important to remember that change should be pursued with caution, as there may be unintended consequences that need to be taken into account.\nIn conclusion, change can be considered good by most people as it allows for constant innovation, improvement, and promotes acceptance and tolerance in society. However, it is important to consider the possible negative consequences that come with change and to pursue it with caution. Change is, therefore, not always good or bad and should be viewed in a nuanced way. As Singaporeans, we need to find a balance between embracing change to improve and innovate while being aware of the potential risks and downsides of change.",
                "d consequences may arise, leading to negative outcomes that nobody foresaw. For instance, the development of the automobile and the internal combustion engine led to massive improvements in transportation and travelling times, but also led to worsening air and noise pollution, congestion, and deteriorating public health in urban areas. Similarly, the increased use of social media and the internet has brought people closer than ever before, but also has also led to increased instances of cyberbullying, spread of misinformation and polarisation of society. The unintended consequences of certain drastic changes can have rippling effects that are difficult to predict beforehand, leading to negative outcomes despite good intentions, and this uncertainty inherent in the outcome of change makes it difficult to classify change as always good.\nMoreover, changes can also be negative for people and communities who are unable to cope with the pace and magnitude of change. Those bearing the brunt of change may suffer from job losses, economic decline, and social upheaval, leading to feelings of despair, anger and alienation. This is particularly true for communities that are already disadvantaged and exist on the margins of society. For instance, the rise of automation and artificial intelligence has led to job losses in industries such as manufacturing and agriculture, leaving many labourers without work and no alternative means of livelihood. Moreover, rapid urbanisation has led to the displacement of indigenous communities in many parts of the world, who have been uprooted from their traditional lands and cultural practices. In such cases, change has led to immense human suffering and has demonstrated that change can be a double-edged sword that can both uplift and destroy communities.\nIn conclusion, change is neither inherently good nor bad but is a complex process that leads to a mix of positive and negative outcomes. While change can bring about improvements in society and can encourage greater innovation and tolerance, the unintended consequences and negative effects of change must also be acknowledged. Change must be approached cautiously and with sensitivity to avoid negative consequences. Ultimately, whether change is good or bad depends on how it is managed and the degree to which it benefits all members of society.",
                "d consequences can occur, often resulting in negative outcomes that can affect a multitude of people. For example, the mass production of goods resulting from the Industrial Revolution in the 19th century significantly improved the economy, but it also led to a rise in pollution, which has negatively impacted both the environment and human health. Similarly, recent advances in technology have led to increased automation of jobs, resulting in widespread unemployment and economic inequality. In both of these examples, the pursuit of progress ultimately resulted in negative consequences that were not initially considered or accounted for. Clearly, change can have far-reaching and complex effects that may not always be beneficial, and it is important to tread carefully when implementing change in society.\nIn conclusion, change can be a force for good when it leads to innovation, acceptance of new ideas and greater adaptability, but it can also have negative effects that may outweigh the positive ones. Change is inherently complex, and its effects may not be immediately apparent, hence we need to be mindful of the possible downsides and balance them with the positive effects that change might bring about. Ultimately, the goodness or badness of change will largely depend on how well it is managed and the extent to which the potential consequences are considered, communicated and addressed.",

For instance, the development of oil drills, nuclear weapons and climate change are all unintended consequences of change and its pursuit in the name of progress. Additionally, rapid changes in technology and automation has created job losses in some sectors, causing economic and social problems. Furthermore, deeper cultural changes can lead to friction between tradition and modernity, and such tension can have negative effects on ethnic and religious relations as well as civil unrest. \n\nAnother downside of change is that it can be destabilising and create upheaval in society, particularly for those who are unprepared for it. Change can also create uncertainty as people struggle to deal with the unknown and unknown consequences of these changes. In some cases, change can disrupt established livelihoods and lead to social upheavals such as in regimes and dictatorships, the Arab Spring being a notable example, where many people lost their lives and things are still not for the better in many countries that saw uprisings. \n\nIn conclusion, while change is generally seen as a positive force and mechanism for growth, it is important to recognise that the effects of change can be complex, and in some cases the downsides of change might outweigh the benefits. Instead of a black and white view of change, society needs to take a more nuanced approach, where we weigh the costs and benefits of change carefully, embracing change where necessary, but being cautious of its potential risks so we can mitigate the negative effects as much as possible. Only through such an approach can we ensure that the change we bring about in the world is as positive and sustainable as possible.",

The development of nuclear weapons is a prime example of how the pursuit of technological advancement can give rise to arms race and lead to grave impacts on geopolitical stability. The detonation of atomic bombs in Japan during World War II was a horrifying manifestation of such pursuit and showed how dangerous the effects of technological advancements can be. Also, the rise of social media and digital technologies has led to concerns over addiction, cyberbullying, and mental health problems, thus highlighting the need for a balance between change and stability in society.\nMoreover, change can have severe repercussions on certain groups, leading to economic and social inequality. For instance, automation and technological advancements have led to the replacement of manual labour with more effective means of production. This may result in job losses and an increase in income inequality, as those who lose their jobs may find it difficult to find meaningful employment. In the same vein, gentrification and urban renewal projects may displace local communities, rendering them homeless and destroying their culture and heritage. In light of these challenges, the effects of change on society as a whole, particularly the marginalised groups, need to be taken into account before embarking on major changes.\nIn conclusion, while change is generally viewed as a force for good, it is important to understand that change is inherently complex and multifaceted. The pursuit of change can bring about great benefits, such as innovation, tolerance, and acceptance. However, the effects of change can also be detrimental, leading to potential unintended consequences and social and economic inequality. The question of whether change is always good, therefore, is one that cannot be answered with a definitive yes or no, as the effects of change are nuanced and dependent on various factors.

For example, the industrial revolution that began in the 18th century brought about many benefits, but it also released large amounts of pollutants into the air and water, leading to environmental degradation. Similarly, the digital revolution of the 21st century has brought about many benefits such as increased connectivity and efficiency in business systems, but it has also led to a variety of negative consequences such as cybercrime, addiction and the spread of fake news. These examples of change highlight the flip side of change \u2013 that if not managed well and if the potential consequences are not thought through, change can be detrimental to society and the environment. Thus, it is important to assess the potential risks of change before implementing it so as to mitigate any negative outcomes that may result.\nIn conclusion, change can be a double-edged sword in that it can bring about benefits, but if pursued without careful consideration of the consequences, it can also lead to harm. While it is largely positive, we must be aware that change does have risks and potential downsides, and that change must also be subjected to critical review so as to ensure that it truly benefits all members of society. Therefore, the reality of change is that it is not always good or bad acts, but rather a complex force with both positive and negative consequences, and while it can be a powerful tool for progress and improvement in society, we must not be complacent about the potential risks and downsides of change and ensure that it is used in a responsible manner to serve the greater good of humanity."

            "human_gen_truncate": "istorically unprecedented growth rate \u2013an average annual growth rate of about 9 per cent for 25 years. In the last 3 decades, China alone has lifted more people out of extreme poverty than the rest of the world combined. Indeed, China's ($1/day) poverty reduction of 627 million from 1981 to 2005 exceeds the total global economy's decline in its extremely poor from 1.9 billion to 1.4 billion over the same period. The proven applications of science have thus underscored its noble intention of creating a more efficient and accessible global village for all of us to live in. However, with the rise of capitalism and profit-maximising enterprises, the noble intentions of science may have become less apparent. Indeed, in a capitalist world where monetary gains are used as a yardstick of economic and social success, many individuals and companies exploit science for greater profits but at a huge social cost. Few years ago, a multinational giant Monsanto introduced a genetically modified corn, which they claimed to be highly resistant to pests and could withstand extreme weather conditions.\nHowever, the genetically modified corn was found to have significantly disrupted liver and kidney functions according to a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences. Despite the findings, Monsanto continues to disregard the product safety concerns that threaten public health in pursuit of profits. Such self-serving behaviour may be traced to the selfish intentions of science, that is to amass wealth for oneself at the expense of others. Hence, there may be less incentive for science to have honourable intentions atall times under the modern capitalist system where the primary goal is the accumulation of individual wealth without any regard to a moral compass.\nMoreover, science will not have noble intentions when it is used to develop weapons. Nuclear science, the study of a nucleus of an atom and its reactions has provided mankind a completely new way to produce huge amounts of energy for people's consumption. On the hand, nuclear science can be used to create a destructive weapon capable of wiping a whole city awayfrom the surface of the Earth. This has caused many nations and terrorist groups to develop nuclear weapons in order to outrun the others in the arms race and protect its country. In World War Two, cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in japan faced the firstdestructive power of nuclear weapons, killing thousands of people in the city instantly. More recently, North Korea developed its nuclear weapon to threaten various countries, forcing the United Nations to accept certain demands made by the Prime Ministerof North Korea, Kim Jung Il. Again, people created develop such weapons to gain power against other nations, and intentions to maintain high moral principles during its scientific developments can be said to be non-existent. Thus, science will not have noble intentions if science was used to develop for the gain of power.\nIn conclusion, science often bears noble intentions to benefit humanity, in ways such as prolonging and saving lives,heightening productivity and paving the way for one world marked by unprecedented global economic and social development . However, as Albert Einstein had said, \"Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist.

Unfortunately, this scientific advancement caused unimaginable death and destruction, leading to the deaths of over 200,000 people. This tragic event serves as a grim reminder of the potential dangers of science and technology when misused.\n\nSimilarly, the use of pesticides in agriculture has led to the destruction of our environment and wildlife. While these pesticides provide an effective way to control pests that can cause huge losses in the agricultural sector, their use at high levels has led to the degradation of soil, water pollution and toxicity to insects and animals. Pesticides have also been linked to potential health risks for humans who consume crops treated with them.\n\nScience also has the potential to exacerbate inequalities in society. For example, gene therapy and genetic engineering offer promising solutions to treating genetic disorders. However, these treatments are expensive and not accessible to all individuals, leading to a widening gap between those who have access to scientific advancements and those who do not.

Consequently it is crucial that the media takes into consideration the audience to which it is targeting by the use of the demographic factor. Indeed, young children who are simple-minded and undiscerning may be easily manipulated by others' perceptions and false factual information. Hence, it is vital that undiscriminating children are sheltered from the profanity, nudity, violence and obscenity we often encounter in the media as adults as it may undermine their beliefs and value system. Nonetheless, there may be readers, apart from children, who are not able to stomach the violence and monstrosity contained in the graphic images or details. To exemplify this, the censoring of morbid images and videos of the Iraq War for the American society was essential to prevent any permanent damaging psychological effects on the general audience. Thus, it is absolutely critical for the media to exercise prudence in ensuring that the materials it produces for public viewing are acceptable across all age groups, so as to not offend any of its viewers. Last but not least, it is the onus of the media to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of any individuals such as witnesses, victims, or sometimes even the perpetrators of crime. When it comes to victims of rape, for instance, the identities of these victims have to be concealed to protect them from public harassment, discrimination or shame. In the case of the rape victim of the actor Michael Le Vell**, after her name was revealed on Twitter, a man suspected ofdisclosing this information was detained. Greater Manchester's police superintendent Phil Davies justified these actions of detainment as public identifications of victims of sex abuse, in particular child victims engaged in court proceedings can cause both immediate and long-term distress and harm. The management of information concerning victims of crime should not be taken lightly as this could be severely damaging and detrimental to their psychological wellbeing, and may also adversely impact their recovery process. For that reason, the media have the duty to ensure the privacy of individuals such as the victims, witnesses and young perpetrators of crime, to protect their identities and any confidential information. To sum up, the media should exercise vigilancebefore bringing up any issue in the vast array of topics. It is the responsibility of the media to protect certain sensitive national security information or confidential individual information. The media should also censor mentally-damaging images to safeguard the psychological wellbeing of its viewers and ensure that they are not at risk of any future repercussions, which may lead to dysfunctional lives.Therefore, governments in any country should work closely with the media to ensure these objectives aren't adequately, so as to maximise the welfare of the citizens.",

It can also cause significant harm to people or organizations involved. Instead, the media should report the facts in a way that can help people understand the issue at hand and encourage public debate and discussion.\n\nMoreover, the media must consider the age-appropriateness of content before reporting them. The media has a significant effect on children who are heavily influenced by what they see, read, or hear. Therefore, reports involving adult content such as sex, drugs, and crime must be reported keeping in mind the impact it might have on the audience. The media must aim to educate the children and not influence their views or beliefs in any way.\n\nLastly, the media must also consider the ongoing investigations before reporting on a topic. The law enforcement authorities may not have all the details they need to solve a case. Premature reporting might lead to the culprits getting away, destruction of evidence, or hindrance to justice. Therefore, the media should wait for investigations to conclude before publishing a report on a case. \n\nIn conclusion, the media has a significant responsibility to society, and it needs to maintain its credibility by upholding journalistic integrity. The media must report only after considering the impact their coverage can have on individuals, society, and national security.

It is unacceptable to air an individual's personal information such as medical records, financial status or private conversations in the media without the individual's consent. The media should ensure that the information they disseminate is accurate and from reliable sources. For instance, British media was criticised for breaching the privacy of Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Markle. In 2019, the papers exposed intimate details of their family life without their permission, which caused an uproar from the public and further fueled anti-media sentiment.\nIn conclusion, the media have been entrusted with the responsibility of keeping the public well-informed on pressing issues without compromising individuals or national security. The media should do this by exercising discretion when selecting the information that should be distributed to the public. They should not sensationalize heinous crimes, respect an individual's personal information or sensitive topics like national security should be handled with utmost caution.

Additionally, it can desensitise the public to violent acts and normalise such behaviour. This can become a societal issue for the future when people become unconcerned about crimes, or even develop a skewed perception of what is acceptable behaviour in society. Thus, it is highly responsible for the media to report crimes factually, without including frightening or grotesque images, speeches or portrayals of the crime scene.\nFinally, there is confidential information and personal details that the media has a responsibility not to publicise without the informed and freely given consent of the individuals involved. It is unethical to divulge highly personal information such as health conditions or family concerns, for example, unless the person or their family decides to reveal it themselves. This is where \"gossip journalism\" can be detrimental, resulting in harmful and unjustified rumours that destroy the reputation of innocent individuals. In situations where personal information is no longer \"private\" and should be made public, such as in the instance of a politician or other public figure and their past behaviour, discretion is needed, as it must be conveyed with impartiality and accuracy, reflecting the journalistic responsibility towards its audience.\n\nIn conclusion, the responsible media is incredibly essential to provide factual, and unbiased news to the public. However, there are some subjects that should not be reported on, to protect the privacy of individuals, national security and to prevent normalising and desensitising the audience to unacceptable behaviour and violent acts. It is the ethical duty of the media to balance between the drive to provide news content and the duty to ensure the preservation of privacy rights and national security concerns.",

For example, relaying the details of a sexual assault may prove to be triggering for others who have undergone similar traumatic events, and it is essential that the media be sensitive to such occurrences and considerate in the way they report such cases.\nMoreover, the personal confidential information of individuals, including their medical reports or financial details, should not be disclosed to the public. The media should not be used as a platform for cyberbullying, harassment or any other non-consensual use or disclosure of private information. While it is understandable that there may be public interest in specific individuals who occupy positions of power, it may cause further complications, especially if there are ongoing investigations and prosecutions. In such instances, the accused's rights to fair trial and presumption of innocence could be compromised, with media outlets' broadcasts potentially jeopardising the plans of the legal system. To sum up, there are certain instances when the media should exercise its authority and abstain from broadcasting information that could be potentially damaging and unethical to both the individual and society as a whole.\nIn conclusion, the media play an important role in keeping the public informed and aware of the happenings in society and around the world.

The media reported grisly details of this mass shooting, including graphic images of the blood-drenched scenes and sobbing victims. The publication of these images could have caused immense trauma to the families and friends of the victims and further destroy the community\u2019s emotional and mental stability. It is thus crucial for responsible journalists and reporters to balance the essential need to report the event while respecting the dignity and privacy of those involved in the situation.\nLastly, the media has a responsibility not to publish personal confidential information, including details of medical records, social security numbers, salary history, and private Communication content. The media must protect personal privacy because the consequences of disclosing sensitive information could be catastrophic. The public's knowledge of financial, medical, or intimate information could lead to stigmatization, blackmail, and harassment against the affected individuals. For instance, in 2014, the Ashley Madison website, an active dating site for users in serious relationships, was hacked, and the valuable data was released to the public, exposing millions of individuals worldwide. The publication of such data could destroy families, careers, and communities. Therefore, the media should balance the obligation to report versus protecting the dignity and welfare of those affected.\nIn summary, the media's Main responsibility is to disseminate accurate and balanced news and information that is important for the public's interest. However, there are a few things that the media must not report. Examples include classified national security information that could endanger public safety, insensitive images and details of gruesome crimes, and personal private information.

In the case of violent crimes such as sexual assaults, newspapers should avoid providing details that can cause psychological harm to its audience.

A news channel can alert the public to a heinous crime without revealing gratuitous details which would cause emotional distress. Ultimately, it's the sole responsibility of the media to showcase compassion, show restraint and avoid overshadowing human dignity.\nFinally, the media should be careful not to break any privacy guidelines. Respect for individual privacy is one of the most delicate issues of our present society, especially in an era of transparency. Journalists should often ask themselves whether the publication ofan individual's private life is worthwhile disclosing. Nevertheless, there will inevitably be situations where an arguably private affair falls under the public domain. As an illustration, consider the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic when current affairs news broke about famous personalities and politicians contracting the virus. Many of them, having scrawled the headlines, talked candidly about their ordeal, opening themselves up to scrutiny. It\u2019s vital, however, not to fall under the guise of tabloid journalism and encroach too much into an individual's personal life.\n\nIn conclusion, the media have a vital role to play in the growth of society and the shaping of people's thoughts. However, the responsible media should always be aware of what to communicate skilfully carefully and what to avoid. Matters of national security, violent crimes, and individual privacy breaches are some examples that require a degree of restraint or refraining entirely from reporting.

Therefore, it is crucial for the media to consider the emotional impact of their reporting on the affected parties.\nLastly, the media have a responsibility not to report confidential and personal information without the given person's consent. An individual's personal information deserves respect and privacy because sharing such details could lead to serious consequences, such as identity theft or cyberstalking. Paparazzi and reporters have been known to go the extra mile to attain personal details of popular figures or celebrities, which can lead to stalking and even endangering the lives of the targeted individuals. Hence, the media should not publish personal information without the owner's knowledge or approval.\nIn conclusion, media outlets must tread carefully when covering certain issues. National security threats, gruesome crime details and personal confidential information should be avoided as much as possible.

This situation highlights the need for media discretion when reporting such incidents. Furthermore, violent or explicit materials have an adverse impact on children, amongst others, who might be viewing such publications, which could affect their emotional and mental well-being.\nLastly, the media also have ethical responsibilities with respect to respecting the privacy of an individual. Reporting someone's personal or confidential information, such as their financial or medical records, without their consent is an invasion of privacy, which can be distressing for the person involved.

It is crucial to understand that extensive coverage of such horrible events may also incite copycats, which may lead to increases in similar attacks. In conclusion, the responsible media must exercise restraint in its reporting on gruesome crimes to respect personal privacy, and not to unnecessarily elevate or glorify such acts.\n\nLastly, the media must not divulge personal or confidential information that could damage a person's reputation or cause them harm. Those who are victims or witnesses of sexual assault, domestic violence, and similar crimes warrant confidentiality, particularly if the information could damage their mental health or even their employment prospects. The information shared on social media can evoke an array of opinions, that could shame those directly or indirectly implicated, putting their psychological well-being at risk. Individuals' private lives must be respected since it is not relevant to their job performances.

In sum, the responsible media should consider the potential effects that its coverage of heinous crimes may have on audiences and be sensitive to such effects.\nAdditionally, the media's coverage of personal confidential information is another issue that requires discretion. Media houses have the responsibility to ensure that a person's privacy is inviolable against disclosure of their personal information, particularly about their lifestyle, family life, and relationships without their consent. Individuals' personal data is protected by a series of regulations, for instance, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union, to secure data privacy and the right to freedom. For instance, social media applications and websites like Twitter and Instagram are advised to uphold the laws. Infringements by the media houses to report on information that has the potential to put individuals' privacy at risk should be identified and rebuked by the relevant regulatory bodies to ensure individuals are adequately protected.\nIn conclusion, media responsibility is essential in ensuring the protection of individuals' privacy, national security and prevention of violence.

Hence, accountability and transparency is key, more so than a well managed economy, for any government that wishes to remain in powerin the twenty-first century.\nStill, such a view has drawn flak from some academics even though studies have shown that good governance is correlated with strong transparency, accountability and economic growth. There is a fear that having too much transparency may bring more harm than good as it would impede the policy making process.This view is supported by a University of Pennsylvania Law research paper that stated that full disclosure of the policy making process may inadvertently cause the leakage of firms' trade secrets that were provided to the government. Companies, being fearful of acts that could dent their profits, would then feel less obliged andrestrict the quality and quantity of information that is made available to the government.Therefore, with incomplete and insufficient evidence or knowledge to craft policies, the final legislature could end up being a bane to the country. Thus, the argument against transparency being a key criterion for an efficient government may hold true despite being seemingly counter-intuitive.\nHowever, some intellectuals contend that the main criterion for good government is to uphold and protect individual rights. Such a government helps to protect our freedom to life, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to vote, inter alia. These are essential features that strengthen civil society development, tolerance and respect for others. They hold that incidents such as the FBI's harassment of civil rights leaders, the Army's spying on the anti-war movement in the 1960s, and more recently, in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the passing of the Patriot Act by President Bush and the Republican Congress, have all but severely undermined the citizens' basic rights and freedoms. The U.S. government greatly increased wiretapping and other forms of surveillance of citizens, often without any evidence of any wrongdoing on their part. Thousands of people were secretly detained for months without any charges against them. Suspected terrorists were denied lawyers and the right to a trial. Some suspects were even sent abroad to other countries so they could be tortured. And 2005 and 2006 revealed the existence of extensive domestic spying programs by the National Security Agency and other institutions that are legally forbidden from doing so \u2013a very disturbing development. Nonetheless,while government policies can sometimes threaten our freedoms, our legislatures and courts are also often the most effective avenues for defending and expanding our rights and liberties \u2013for the general good \u2013based on utilitarianism.\nIn conclusion, it is unfair and misguided to posit that the key criterion for good government is how well the economy is managed. It ignores the fact that accurately assessing a government's levels of efficiency and competency is both complicated and perplexing. While a well-managed economy may be able to signal the high degree of competency of a government through the fulfilment of citizens' material well-being, this overly simplistic measure fails to provide a holistic evaluation of the government. Hence, a more superior assessment should also include criteria such as accountability and transparency andto a smaller extent, democratic rights.\nIndeed, countries are increasingly cognisant of the importance of using a multifaceted approach to measure their political monoliths.",

In today's world, it is crucial for governments to prioritize tackling climate change by adopting policies that promote sustainable practices. Governments must prioritize protecting natural resources and mitigating the negative impact their actions and policies might have on the environment. Thus, a good government should invest in renewable energy sources and encourage environmental innovation, which will benefit both spiritual health and economic perspectives.\n\nFinally, a good government needs to promote international cooperation and diplomacy to ensure global peace and stability. A well-managed economy presents opportunities for nations to engage in international relationships and enable more open and equitable trade. International cooperation also involves aid provision and working with other nations to address global issues such as pandemics and refugees. Effective diplomatic relations with the international community can result in agreements that bring about peace and stability, which ultimately advances the interests of the citizens of sovereign states.\n\nTo conclude, while the management of a country's economy is undeniably significant, it is not the be-all and end-all of effective governance. Democracy, accountability, equality, environmental responsibility, and international cooperation are all core principles that any government should strive to uphold. Good governance transcends the pursuit of economic prosperity, and putting the interests of its citizens at the center of policy-making is the only way to ensure that the society operates for the greater good of all its members.",

            "prompt": "Is there a more urgent need for religion in today's world?",
            "human_gen_truncate": ". This may have led some to believe that life is meaningless and is all for naught. Consequently, the conciliatory role of religion becomes increasingly important as it offers a psychological solution by elucidating the constructs of heaven and an afterlife that provide solace and comfort amid such depressing frames of mind. Hence, despite its apparent flaws, the emotional element of religion is needed more so than ever in today's rapidly evolving world plagued with insecurities.\nFurthermore, many religions seek to provide social support for the underclass. In spite of the massive strides made by the global community in alleviating absolute poverty,most notably the drastic decrease of over 70 per cent since 1978, many around the world still live in relative poverty. This is evident in a 2006 United Nations study that found the top one per cent of the world controls more wealth than the bottom 95% altogether. To these people struggling in the quagmire of poverty, religion plays a pivotal social support role in these pressing times. For instance, the Sikhs openly welcome visitors to their Gurdwaras, their place of worship. Many homeless non-Sikhs often turn up at these places looking for food and shelter, to the extent that over five thousands meals were served in the 250 Gurdwaras in 2013 in Britain alone. Additionally, most religions stipulate that their followers should care for the economic well-being of those in their communities through acts of charity. For instance, a central concern in the Qur'an is the treatment of the poor, marginalized, and disadvantaged. Islamic teachings enjoin all Muslim adults, who are financially able, to make donations and pay an obligatory alms tax of a percentage of their assets . In fact, Muslims had been named as being the most generous in the United Kingdom in 2012, as they donated more than the Christians, Jews and Atheists. This highlights the indispensability of religion which provides an additional social safety net alongside government aid and given the current economic turmoil arising from the Eurozone crisis, such unconditional help has proven to be especially invaluable. Thus, from a realistic point of view, there is a more urgent need for religion in today's world.\nIn conclusion, while religion may have its shortcomings, but so is every human construct. The arguments outlined earlier have illuminated the far-reaching merits of religion, specifically the emotional and social assistance religion can offer in today's globalised world inundated with unprecedented complexityand dynamic competition. Therefore, dispelling religion for its flaws does not do justice to these beneficial attributes that are in fact worthy of respect and appreciation. However, to avoid a head-on confrontation between science and religion in search of worldly answers, it is important to cultivate wisdom instead of following one's faith blindly. Therefore, as long as pious people interpret their religious principles in the context of their own cultural background and take responsibility for their faith in the environment they inhabit by adapting to the changing societal norms and expanding academia, religion would continue to provide more solutions than problems in today's world.",

These communities participate in various charity and outreach programs that help bring aid and comfort to disadvantaged people.

The world today is increasingly polarised, with identity politics shaping many individual's worldviews. Religion, on the other hand, has a largely inclusive agenda of universality, including all human beings, regardless of their ethnicity or race. Often, religions advocate for voluntary efforts towards community service and in helping the needy. For example, Christians participate in charity work and volunteering during Christmas, while Muslims perform Zakat, a form of obligatory charity, during their holy month of Ramadan. Such acts of compassion demonstrate that religions do advocate for peace and, if practiced correctly, can play a significant role in solving modern-day problems.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly negative aspects to religion, it is important to recognise the positive aspects, like emotional support, moral guidance, and social bonding, that it provides. Ultimately, it is not a matter of needing or not needing religion but of recognising its positive influence while remaining critical of its excesses.

As a result, the Chinese media \u2013the Communist government's mouthpiece \u2013has been fervently producing eye-opening, in-depth investigative reports on a myriad of environmental problems from air pollution to water pollution. This evidently shows how critical is the people's voice in the piece of action in saving the shared environment.\nMoreover, with the support of capablegovernment leadership, technology has immenselymitigated the dire effects of the epidemics that proliferate in the world today. Many of the diseasestoday are extremely malignant, having a fast rate of transmission and alarming levels of casualties as a result.Furthermore, it has translated into a heavier burden on an individual in their medical cost and a decrease in labour productivity should the disease spread to many people. For example, a scourge of the world is smallpox where an estimated 300 million people died from it in the 20th century alone.Such a death toll vividly shows the severity ofthe disease outbreak that can threaten the survival of mankind if no proper safeguards are put in place. Fortunately, technology has given rise to many new vaccines that manage to successfully contain and eradicate the host of contagions that have occurred throughout over the last century. For instance, Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Switzerland's Cytos Biotechnology AG announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial with their H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate based on Cytos' proprietary bacteriophage Qbeta virus-like particle (VLP) technology where the safety and immunogenicity of this novel vaccine candidate and its potential to protect against H1N1 influenza infection will be evaluated. Although such timely medical treatments have been paramount, the aversion of an apocalyptic crisis would have not been successful without the effective government administration manifested in the use of contingency plans.At the end of the 1960s, while smallpox was still endemic in Africa and Asia, vaccination campaigns, surveillance and prevention measures aimed to contain epidemic hotspots and to better inform affected populations made huge unprecedented contributions to surmounting the epidemic. Through all these efficacious strategies and collaborative efforts of countries,smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1980 and is the first disease to have been fought on a global scale.This sterling result has evidently shown how imperative is effective publicplanning in the medical field which ultimately led to the complete eradication of the malady.\nIn conclusion, while technology is an important key to solve major crisis in the world, it is no panacea.We have to rely on other equallyvital elementssuch as societal influence and competentgovernment administration to bring sustainable answersto the pressing world issues of modern day.",

The management believes that libraries are now becoming hands-on creative hubs, places where people can learn new crafts and experiment with technology such as 3-D printers. This not only helps people to detach their minds off their hectic schedule, it also helps to shelter them from the pressures of our modern day society which is heavily concerned with productivity and gains in material wealth. Therefore, I believe that libraries are cardinalplaces thatallow people to soothe their minds and discover their new strengths andinterests.\nFinally, people have recognised that libraries play an imperative role in preserving a country's heritage today. A library can also be considered a national monument that helps to safeguarda nation's heritage and shows how a country has advanced and developed throughout the years. Many bemoan the demolishment of these iconic buildings that helped people form a collective history and define their very own identities. Demolishing it to the pave the way for urban development would be seen as ripping away a considerable aspect of a country's identity. The old National Library in Singapore is a prime example of how such symboliclandmarks had to make way for urban development which received much public dissent in 2004. The controversy of such a demise has sparked greater awareness of local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans. This shows how much people value such sentimental buildings that hadonce played a significant role in our heritage. Thus, libraries are not redundant in today's world as many still have cultural appeal and historical significance that anchor us together and establish a sense of identity for us.\nIn conclusion, libraries continue to have an indispensable role in today's society.

Studies have shown that if we are to continue relying on crude oil as our main source of energy at this rate, there will only be enough for 42 years, implying that we may be facing a severe depletion of this precious energyresource. It is hence essential for us to uncover new and innovative means to obtain renewable energy. Renewable energy is important in sustaining mankind's economic development and environmental preservation. Renewable energy, by definition, is inexhaustible in contrast to fossil fuels, which will eventually run out. This is a pivotal point to consider in the light of our steadily growing population size facing diminishing fossil fuel supplies as the rate of depletion significantly outpaces the rate of discovery and extraction. Hence renewable energy would be a more desirable alternative to fossil fuels. Another major benefit of renewable energy is that such forms of energy have limited environmental impact. Good These clean forms of energy generate minimal pollution and emissions, if not at all. Good On the contrary, the refinement process of crude oil produces many solid toxic wastes such as mercury and other heavy metals, and the burning of fossil fuels often discharges arsenic and lead into surface waters while both release a substantial amount of pollutants into the air. These pollutants cause respiratory illnesses and deaths in humans, and give rise to acid rain, which erodes infrastructure and destroys fragile eco-systems. These harmful effects are very detrimental to our economic development and environment, greatly hampering global productivity as a consequence. Therefore,it would be wise to focus on the research on sources of renewable energy.\nLast but not least, another important area of research should be targeted at the issues of environmental degradation caused by pollution and global climate change. Increasing technological advancement has also yielded greater environmental damage in the form of pollutant emissions, which have long-lasting effects on our commonly shared environment. For example, the increasing mechanization and commercialization of agricultural produce causes water pollution and disrupts eco-systems and aquatic life. Besides, pollutants emitted from deforestation contribute to global warming, which could escalate into a environmental crisis if not properly managed and dealt with. It also causes soil erosion that results in land degradation. These are pressing environmental issues that can majorly impact mankind and his future. Thus, it is vital for us to prioritise scientific research in existing and potential environmental issues and the ways to alleviate them. Therefore,I feel that in the next decade, environmental preservation should be one of the key priorities of scientific research, especially in an increasingly industrialized world.\nIn conclusion, the three key areas of scientific research to be prioritized in the next decade are the research and development on food genetics, renewable energy, as well as environmental sustainability and protection. By simultaneously targeting all three areas, the aggregate impact may be substantially greater than the individual impacts since the benefits are mutually reinforcing, such as the use of renewable energy would also help to improve the problem of environmental degradation.

Renewable energy technologies such as solar energy, wind energy and hydro energy are an alternative to traditional energy sources as they have little to no negative side effects on the environment and offer unlimited energy supply, making them an excellent candidate for future energy resource.\nMoreover, renewable energy research can contribute significantly to cutting down carbon emissions which is critical in addressing climate change. The importance of reducing carbon emissions is highlighted in last year\u2019s United Nations Climate Change Agreement, where nations pledged to limit the rise in global average temperatures to below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels to avoid catastrophic consequences of climate change. Therefore, prioritising renewable energy research in the next decade can be advantageous to mitigate and ultimately halt the damage done by climate change.\nHowever, opponents may argue that renewable energy research should not be prioritised as it may be an expensive venture that may not deliver the desired results. However, looking at past success stories such as South Africa\u2019s Solar Park, which is a massive solar energy farm and has become a national landmark, we can see that the fruitful implementation of renewable energy is not as far-fetched as it may seem.\nLastly, scientists should focus on environmental preservation. Human activities have wreaked havoc on the environment, be it deforestation, land degradation, pollution or global warming. Environmental preservation is in urgent need of attention to prevent irreversible damage to our planet. Over the next decade, scientists should focus on developing strategies and technologies to reverse this damage and save our planet. For example, research can be conducted on creating more effective ways to reduce carbon emissions from cars, developing mechanisms to preserve biodiversity, and studying new technology that can help preserve and clean the planet's oceans.\nFinally, some can argue that environmental preservation is low in priority as it does not lead to immediate gain. It is critical to realize that without preserving our planet, our chances of survival diminish. Environmental degradation has a direct impact on our health, economy, and ultimately our survival. Thus, environmental preservation should be a top priority.\nIn conclusion, the next decade should be an exciting time for scientific discoveries, with the world facing challenges that demand innovative solutions. Future research should focus on food security, renewable energy, and environmental preservation. These aspects of scientific research are necessary for improving our quality of life, preserving our planet, and ensuring a sustainable future. Mankind\u2019s focus on these three key areas can undoubtedly unlock vast potential to allow us to reach higher heights and better prepare us for any catastrophe that may arise.",

Hence, it is essential for us to consider alternative sources of energy that are sustainable and environmentally friendly. Many scientists and researchers have been working on renewable energy sources such as solar, wind and hydro energy, as well as biofuels. Such alternatives could be beneficial in the long run as they have a low carbon footprint and are inexhaustible. The use of renewable energy would reduce our reliance on fossil fuels, protect the environment and ultimately contribute to long-term sustainable development. Renewable energy is, therefore, one of the three significant areas of scientific research that I believe mankind should focus on in the next decade.\nLastly, environmental preservation is another key area of scientific research that should be prioritised in the next decade. In our present-day world, the call for sustainability in all sectors and economic activities has become critical more than ever. The world is currently plagued with  natural disasters caused by climate change. For instance, with global warming, the sea level is gradually rising, causing flooding in coastal areas. Furthermore, the planet's temperature is rising due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by human activity such as deforestation, land use changes and air pollution. It is crucial for scientists to come together and focus on the development of a sustainable environment, which is not only beneficial for humans but also for the plants and animals that share our planet. By prioritizing the scientific research in this area, we would be able to map out ways of reducing pollution and mitigating climate change. Such areas of research could include the formulation of policies that encourage people to reduce their carbon footprint, or the development of technology for carbon capture, sequestration, and storage. Environmental preservation would contribute to an overall healthy and sustainable environment that will benefit humanity for centuries to come. Therefore, environmental preservation should be one of the three areas of scientific research that mankind should prioritise in the next decade.\nIn conclusion, scientific research is an essential aspect of the modern era, contributing to further advancements in technology, healthcare, and society at large. In the next decade, I believe that mankind should prioritise scientific research on food genetics, renewable energy, and environmental preservation. By focusing on these areas, we could make significant progress in mitigating the adverse effects of climate change and global warming, curbing food shortages, and transitioning to more sustainable energy sources. Nonetheless, there are other areas of scientific research as well, and it is up to mankind to decide which areas are of higher priority based on the pressing needs of our society and the global community.",
                ". However, reliance on these sources has its limitations, besides the fact that they remain non-renewable, hence studies on renewable energy sources are in the pipeline. Some researchers have already championed the use of solar, wind, hydro, geothermal and biomass as an alternative source of energy which would be able to sustain our energy demand amidst the rise in population. This certainly calls for the prioritization of such research in the next decade. Fortunately, previous research has shown that renewable energy sources would be able to cater for our energy demand for the next half of the century. Therefore, prioritizing renewable energy research is vital to ensure a sustainable future for us and generations down the line.\nFinally, environmental preservation is an area of scientific research that should not be overlooked in the coming decade.

Therefore, democracy in its raw form may not often be the best as it may cause political parties to lose sight of its actual aims and instead become a popularparty through deception to win its way into government. As such, it often results in the inability of the government to fulfil its promises given at the rallies.\nSecondly, although the elected individuals are mandated to represent their supporters and decide on policies that will benefit the country, they are ultimately still humans and thus are equally vulnerable to the same human temptations. As such they may become corrupt and implement venal policies for their personal selfish gains. An example is the previous president of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovych. He allegedly misappropriated part of Ukraine's savings to build his lavish mansion, which houses golden taps and a collection of motorcycles and cars worth millions of dollars. Up till now, he still insists that he funded his house with his savings, even though he merely earns fifteen thousand pounds annually. This notorious example has showcased the immense corruption that can possibly occur, where politicians entrenched in power may abuse the public trust and loyalty to their own favour. Thus, even if morally upright politicians are democratically elected, they may eventually succumb to financial temptations and often render democracy not the best political system.\nFinally, in many democratic countries today, many outcomes are premeditated by the political representatives while feedback and open discussions are often not sought from the people. Thus this has increasingly raised doubts on the level of \"democracy\" in a\"democratic society\". For example, in Singapore, there is a piece of legislation that was recently enacted which is often said to be a violation of Singaporeans' freedom of speech. This legislation is called the Online Licensing Framework, where this framework requires websites that report on Singapore news with a readership of at least 50,000 over a period of a month to pay for a license to continue operating. Furthermore, they have to obey any notices received from the government and take down any articles deemed as untruthful. This led to many Singaporeans, especially the anti-PAP (the incumbent ruling political party of Singapore) activists to express even greater dissatisfaction with the government. The distaste for this legislation stems from the factthat government is trying to limit the content Singaporeans get to read, thereby effectively diminishing the ability of Singaporeans to post their criticisms of the government. Therefore, democratic governments today, may run the risk of getting too much power which could lead to them unknowingly robbing the citizens of their rights. As such, democracy may not be generally the best.\nIn conclusion, even though democracy allows the people to have greater say in how their country is run, there are several unintended byproductsof the democratic systems due to the insufficient knowledge of the population, the shortcomings of human nature and the ability of politicians toabuse their power. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that democracy is often not the best system. Yet with felicitous modifications tomitigate its inherent ills, it will be a better system.",

Some societies may value stability and order over individual rights and freedoms. In such cases, democracy may not be the best system of government for that society.\n\nIt is also important to note that democracy is not necessarily the most effective system. In certain situations, an authoritarian government may be more effective in achieving its goals. For example, during times of crisis, such as war or natural disasters, an authoritarian government may be better equipped to make quick decisions and mobilize resources.\n\nIn conclusion, while democracy is often the best system of government, it is not always the best. Democracy has its strengths, such as promoting transparency and accountability, but it also has its limitations, such as the risk of gridlock and the potential for populist leaders.

As such, they are inclined to support policies and leaders that are advantageous to them, which may not necessarily be the best for all. This would lead to the situation of the \"tyranny of the majority\" where policies which benefit the majority will be chosen instead of those that are more beneficial for all. This was evident in the American political system where the Republican party had gerrymandered districts to favour their party, resulting in an unfair distribution of political power which favoured the party that had more votes than the other. \n\nThus, to fully reap the benefits of democracy, it is imperative that the system is constantly reviewed and modified where necessary. The education system should be structured in such a way that would foster critical thinking skills and provide adequate information for the electorate to make informed decisions.

            "prompt": "Is foreign intervention justified?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "c intervention almost exclusively comes with strings attached. This can be seen in how the World Bank's attempts to intervene in African nations in the 1990s through micro finance programmes have largely failed to achieve success. To the contrary, they have crippled these economies by eliciting in debt collections over twenty billion USD per anum. Similarly, Greece was crippled by punitive sovereign debt that deprived its central bank and government the ability to flex its fiscal muscle, precluding its ability to exercise fiscal autonomy. This was because other countries had the contractual upper hand in demanding for their money back. Second, even when intervention itself comes with no strings attached, countries subject themselves to the diplomatic whims and fancies of the interventionists, hence mortgaging future economic growth for short lived boosts in economic performance. Angola watched itself give up sixty percent of oil assets to Chinese multinationals following their intervention in the Angolan economy whereas Yemen watched its economy crumble at the hands of the United States that suspended all USAID intervention programmes on the eve of the first Gulf War when the Yemeni ambassador voted against a United States resolution advocating for military intervention in Iraq in the Security Council. Third, ignorance of the intervening countries may inadvertently debilitate the economies they intervene in, even in the rare instances where there are few or no strings attached. What seemed like benevolent assistance, US intervention in the Guyana economy crippled it when US products displaced the local market mechanism by introducing superior but cheaper US products, thereby driving local Guyanese products out of the market, and forcing local producers to poverty. Such was also the case in Mozambique. What is known to economists as the 'Dutch Disease Effect' further erodes the competitiveness of countries intervened in, crippling them in the long run. This highlights how economic intervention, due to its nature of conditionality, its potential for diplomatic leverage, and the ignorance of the intervening party largely debilitates the economies they seek to nurture, rendering them indefensible.\n Lastly, intervention of any form on the supranational level where countries, under set international framework, intervene in others with or without consent cannot be condoned due to its lack of accountability and its entrapment in rigid bureaucracy maligned by political self interest. Such factors have been noted to deteriorate the very conditions intervention may seek to address. Lack of oversight in organisations with the authority to intervene, like the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has ironically led to war crimes in conflicts they were mobilised to dissipate. Cases of UN Peacekeeper brutality and even the rape of uninvolved civilians by parties in such a position of trust, a gross abrogation of the commitments undertaken to International Humanitarian Law under the Geneva Conventions, is not unheard of. This form of coalition intervention dramatically reduces the ability to effect necessary oversight as it makes the apportioning of blame and the application of punitive measures to any one party overtly difficult. This can serve to exacerbate already tense situations, as was the case with UN intervention in East Timor. Furthermore, supranational intervention of any one or few countries into another under international framework inspires a false sense of confidence in the international community of the ability of said intervention to be effective. As evidenced by various instances of political gridlock due to competing objectives and self-interest, such faith is misplaced. It both deters other forms of effective conflict resolution and itself fails to achieve any results compounding the issues faced in the country needing intervention. Such was the case in Rwanda where neighbouring Uganda decided not to intervene despite repeated calls by the incumbent government as the UN Mission in Rwanda had already been deployed. However, when the world needed it, political gridlock in the Security Council precluded the authorisation for troops already stationed in Rwanda to mobilise and act; Peacekeepers had to helplessly watch as Hutu turned on Tutsi and slaughtered one another on the bloodied streets of Kigali. This serves to show that supranational intervention both lacks much needed oversight and is subjected to bureaucratic inefficiency amidst political self-interest. It is thus that intervention is unjustifiable - far from solving the problems of other countries, it either directly contributes to them or otherwise deters the implementation of effective solutions, while itself being ineffectual.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention of most forms, except for humanitarian responses to disasters, compounds the very problems they seek to resolve and thus cannot be justified on both principle and practical grounds. This then begs the question - why does intervention continue to exist today, and how else can the international community respond? To address the former, experts in the field of international relations posit that it is but a way to consolidate political clout, present themselves as bastions of ideals such as democracy, and for large powers to satiate their modern day \"white saviour complex\", thereby pinning motivations behind intervention on self interest, as opposed to altruism. To address the later, perhaps there is no ideal way to resolve issues in the hotchpotch of international relations - for saying that intervention is unjustifiable is not to say other methods of conflict resolution and nation building are more effective. Perhaps this conundrum is best summarised by the sagacious words of Friedrich Nietschze who mused on the idea of moral relativism. He opined that to any problem - \"There is your way, and there is mine. As for the right way, it does not exist.\"",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "lence and conflict. Military intervention often results in more violence, leading to the displacement of communities and the loss of homes and assets. For instance, the US intervention in Iraq in 2003 led to immense loss of life for both the citizens of Iraq and the military personnel who were sent to the country.\n\nAnother negative consequence of foreign intervention is the unintended consequences that it can have. Military intervention might lead to a change in government but not always for the better. A new government might not be stable enough to provide the necessary support and services, which exacerbates the problems and the suffering of the citizens. The 2011 intervention by NATO in Libya led to the downfall of the Gaddafi regime, but also created a power vacuum, leading to political instability and economic turmoil.\n\nFurthermore, foreign intervention can be criticized for being based on self-interest rather than humanitarian concerns. Countries might get involved in other countries' affairs simply to advance their own interests, such as securing resources or expanding their influence. The Western interventions in the Middle East during the 20th century are often criticized for being driven by the desire for oil rather than for humanitarian reasons.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention can be justified but only in certain circumstances. While it might be necessary to protect human rights or to stop an oppressive regime, it can lead to unintended consequences and increased violence. As citizens and leaders, it is our responsibility to carefully weigh the pros and cons of foreign intervention and make thoughtful decisions based on humanitarian concerns rather than self-interest.",

                "c intervention by big powers carries the implicit threat of coercion and neo-colonialism; it requires conformity to the ideals of the intervening nation, undermining the sovereign authority of the receiving nation. Second, economic intervention may lead to the prominence of foreign corporations in local economies, leading to a continued cycle of exploitation due to the local unavailability of the skill sets exhibited in the direct industries. This is the case with the mining of cobalt in Congo by multinational corporations, that hire the locals for pennies, while selling the raw materials to Western nations at exorbitant prices. Third, the introduction of foreign market-oriented policies may make economies reliant on foreign aid, and unable to sustain themselves after the withdrawal of foreign aid, leading to a spiral of debt and underdevelopment. This is the case with international sanctions imposed on Iran in 2013, that led to a significant drop in oil exports, serious decline in standards of living, and the rise of black markets. It can thus be reasonably suggested that foreign intervention through economic mechanisms is largely unjustifiable as it debilitates the economy and enriches Western economies while exploiting others.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention beyond the humanitarian paradigm is largely unjustifiable, as it only exacerbates the very crisis it seeks to ameliorate. Such intervention prolongs conflicts, produces unintended consequences, and disembowels economies, rendering them reliant on the very donations that contribute to their miseries. Fundamentally, this intervention denies the basic principles of sovereignty, promoting neo-colonialism and the imposition of beliefs and values inherent to foreign nations.",
                "c intervention is often a disguised form of neo-colonialism, using debt to secure foreign interests and exploit the resources of these countries. Second, the imposition of strict economic policies by institutions like the World Bank and International Monetary Fund only deepens economic inequalities, promoting poverty and exacerbating the very conditions they seek to eliminate. Third, and most importantly, economic intervention undermines local economies, leading to a dependence on foreign aid and a loss of national independence, sovereignty and control. Through concepts like the structural adjustment program, that required governments to cut social spending in order to repay debt, development aid has had the ironic effect of producing less development and growth, failure to balance need and scarcity and imposition of policies that were detrimental to the interests of the recipient countries.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention, be it political, economic or military, is largely unjustifiable as interventions, largely exacerbate the very problems they aim to ameliorate and worsen lives in more ways than one. While humanitarian intervention can be warranted in times of crises, other forms of intervention only serve to increase instability and should not be condoned.",
                "c intervention is often motivated by the interests of the intervening country rather than the receiving country, and the terms of such interventions are often so exploitative that they serve to keep poor countries indebted and therefore underdeveloped. Take the example of Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) of the World Bank that require recipient countries to implement certain economic policies in exchange for loans. These policies have proven to be detrimental to local economies, devastating cocoa farmers in Ivory Coast, and ruining rice yields for small farmers in Indonesia, leading to increasing income inequality, decreased standards of living and civil unrest in these countries. Additionally, these interventions often entrenched and institutionalize the very systemic problems they seek to eradicate, through the implementation of neoliberal economic policies that create oligopolies in certain sectors, such as United Fruit Company's banana monopolies in Latin America leading to long-term exploitation of those \"free\" economies and the environment alike. As such, even when done with the best of intentions, economic intervention can rarely be justified, as it often only reinforces the existing exploitative economic relations between countries and serves to perpetuate poverty, not alleviate it.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention per se cannot be justifiable as it worsens the problems it seeks to tackle, whether these be political, military or economic. While humanitarian intervention may seem justifiable, it should only be embarked upon when authorized by the government of the country to be intervened upon, and preferably as part of an international coalition. This ensures that intervention truly serves the interests of the people and not just those of intervening countries. The problems intrinsic to military and economic intervention render these forms of intervention largely indefensible and interference by foreign entities can be the cause of long-term damage and desolation to the people of the nation under attack. The world must learn to respect sovereignty and trust in the ability of local governments to solve their own problems, while supporting them in a conscientious manner when they ask for it.",
                "c intervention is often perceived as imperialistic, and in attempting to \"help\" developing countries, it creates a sort of dependency syndrome, denying the countries they intervene in of the chance to develop autonomously. Additionally, economic intervention targets largely infrastructure projects - the building of roads, training of workers and provision of loans which are vulnerable to corruption which unequally distributes resources and power away from those who need them most. They integrate the country into the global neo-colonial order that deprioritizes the needs of these countries, such as agricultural and healthcare needs, generating waste on one end and encouraging industrialisation over non-exploitative subsistence agriculture on another. Thus, economic intervention is unjustifiable.\nIn order to conclude, it is imperative to consider the obligations every state has both to their citizens and to their international community. The Responsibility to Protect framework exists to importantly balance compassion for suffering civilians with respect for the sovereignty of foreign nations. However, history has shown that unscrupulous and unauthorised intervention not only destabilises entire regions, but also devastates, the autonomy of the nations it intervenes in. Foreign intervention, whether diplomatic, military or economic, cannot be justified as such actions warrant the imposition of the values of the intervenors onto those of other states and thus undermine the sovereignty of other states. Foreign intervention, like colonialism before it, has wrecked havoc on countless nations around the world. The only justifiable form of intervention is one based on local collaboration and ownership, where locals and international organisations work hand in hand to identify pressing issues, and establish stable and peaceful societies.",
                "c intervention by foreign powers often come with strings attached, rendering it nothing more than coercion in disguise. In most cases, intervention has been deployed to favour the vested interests of the intervening country, most notably for economic dominance. The Bretton Woods Conference established the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with objectives including the promotion of economic growth in developing nations, however there has been a monumental failure in achieving this goal. Instead, economic intervention often results in the weakening of developing economies, leading to a labyrinth of debt and dependency that renders them incapable of making sovereign decisions and even servicing their own debts. The World Bank's policies of structural adjustment seen in the Democratic Republic of Congo did nothing to alleviate economic woes, instead paving the way for the country to ransack its natural resources over land to offset debt service payments. Equally, Malaysia's reliance on the IMF to stave off its debt in the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis serves as an exemplary case study that shows how economic intervention retards growth rather than spur it. The reforms were pushed through aid packages that saw the country pummel its own banks, devalue its currency as well as slash public spending; resulting in a long period of deflation and economic downturn. In essence, economic intervention overwhelmingly fails in its objective of speeding up economic growth, and instead embeds external instead of domestic domination and economic ennui, worsening conditions they aim to solve.\nTo conclude, foreign intervention is largely unjustifiable beyond humanitarian intervention that is non-intrusive. Military intervention is destabilising, devolving from a local conflict into a bigger conflict, providing factions with the necessary resources to prolong their image, sustaining disorder and aggravating the suffering of civilians caught up in it. Economic intervention too should be discouraged, as it undermines the very countries it aims to serve, slowly imposing a labyrinth of debt and dependency that renders these countries incapable of making sovereign decisions. In essence, it is imperative that foreign interventionists reconsider their current approaches, while focusing on stimulating the viable growth strategies of their economies to primarily uplift their populace.",
                "c intervention typically comes with conditionalities, framed in Western economic ideologies that deny local governments the agency to self-determine their policies and interventions. This, predictably, leads to resentment and backlash from the local population that feel their sovereignty and decision-making abilities are usurped. Moreover, funding local governments is known to lead to 'rentierism' - ill-advised opaque deals that focus exclusively on bolstering domestic elites at the cost of the common man. To illustrate this, consider the case of the Niger Delta in Nigeria where Shell and other oil companies received Contracts of Service that were undisclosed to the public and earned them the right to pollute the entire area and suppress activism. Consequently, generations of Nigerian youth stood up against such companies, leading to arrests, displacements and oppression. These circumstances highlight the need for local agency to be preserved, and transparency to be fostered in economic decisions to ensure sustainability without leading to long-term instability. In conclusion, foreign intervention is unjustifiable as it is largely counterproductive and exacerbates local problems instead of addressing them holistically.",
                "c intervention by multinational corporations and international financial institutions often come with strings attached, such as draconian structural adjustment directives that impose budget cuts, inflating the costs of local goods and services and benefitting foreign investors at the expense of local consumers. This unhealthy practice reinforces neoliberalism, creating conditions for large multinational corporations to exploit cheap labour and massive mineral resources at the expense of the developing countries. Second, economic intervention measures engineered by other countries in response to violations of multilateral trade agreements, in principle, create unfair trade practices and deny governments the crucial space to implement measures of economic self-determination. The European Union's call for the Kenyan government to lift a ban on exporting French beans in 2021, itself unfair, came at a time of already struggling markets made worse by Covid-19. Economic sanctions are, therefore, unjustifiable in that they undermine the principle of sovereign equality of states. In a world of crisis where every state is interdependent and where economic systems are more integrated than ever, economic interventionism in all forms must be frowned upon.\n\nIn conclusion, although humanitarian intervention to ameliorate crises has its merits, foreign intervention beyond such humanitarian aims, whether military or economic, exacerbates conditions for citizens and countries, creating instability and denying countries the opportunity to determine their economic destinies. The debate that erupted over whether foreign intervention is justified or not shows no signs of abating any time soon, given the ethical, political and economic factors that underpin the discussion. However, it is becoming more crucial now more than ever to reconsider foreign intervention in the light of its potential to destabilise politics and economics, and its long-term consequences.",
                "c intervention often comes with strings attached, which may not benefit the society or economy as a whole but merely the agenda of the intervening economy. This manifests itself in loans with high-interest rates that weigh on developing economies, promulgation of trade policies that benefit the interveners, among others. Second, economic intervention often replaces domestic investment opportunities in countries allowing multinational corporations more control over the local economy, further exacerbating neo-colonialism tendencies. Third, as seen in examples across Latin America and Africa, policies of privatisation (mandated by the World Bank and IMF) have led to profiteering at the expense of local communities, where access to basic necessities such as water, healthcare and education is \u201cmonetised\u201d through foreign investments in the country. These instances vindicate that economic interventions in foreign countries are not justifiable and instead burden the very economies which they claim to be nurturing towards development.\n\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention is not justifiable beyond the humanitarian context. As seen in the cases of Iraq, Somalia, Mozambique and others, interventions have led to long-term instability and exacerbated the epidemics of violence, exacerbating the situations they claim to solve. Interventionism in principle is a disregard for sovereignty that maintains international peace and stability, and, in practice, only worsens the strife. Even in the humanitarian context, there have been instances of corruption and failure but usually with good intentions. However, economic intervention has led to neo-colonialism tendencies, destabilised economies, and unsatisfactory results. The world community should thus reconsider before intervening, as it requires ethical analysis of global concerns over the narrow interests of \u201cneo-colonialist\u201d interests.",
                "c exploitation is often a facet of economic intervention, in which the intervening country extracts valuable resources from the local economy without returning equivalent returns to the local people. Such exploitation, far from improving the economy, drains it dry and perpetuates cycles of poverty and indebtedness. Secondly, economic intervention, through the imposition of capitalistic policies, stifles local industries and renders them less competitive against larger global corporations, ultimately destroying them and in turn harming the economy. The Three-Point Structural Adjustment Programme imposed on many African countries was criticised for imposing such policies, leading several countries into debt crises, impoverishing the population and sometimes even leading to famines, as seen in Malawi. Finally, economic intervention makes governments dependent on the intervening countries, effectively eroding their sovereignty and political authority. The International Monetary Fund imposes fiscal policies on countries they lend to, often infringing on their ability to govern and compromising their authority to represent the interests of their people. All these factors illustrate that economic intervention is largely unjustifiable.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention in principle is indefensible, and in practice it often makes matters worse. While humanitarian intervention is a defensible aspect of intervention, economic and military intervention exacerbate the very problems they aim to ameliorate. The state, by its intrinsic nature, exists as a sovereign unit of the international community, and external intervention has often been criticised for upending this fundamental principle that dictates state sovereignty. It is thus necessary to respect such sovereignty, while simultaneously offering empathic aid to countries in times of crisis.",
                "c development must come from within, with state-led efforts and input from local leaders that best understand their specific needs. As such, it is difficult to wholly justify the external imposition of economic policy when there could be cultural sensitivities that are overlooked by external actors. Furthermore, aid packages and other forms of economic support often carry conditions that countries require to adhere to, such as political liberalisation and openness to trade that are not necessarily compatible with local cultures, and localised production systems. This conditionality essentially cripples recipient countries' agencies to formulate policy which leads to an erosion of sovereignty, the paradox of the same sovereignty that is purportedly being respected through non-military intervention, leaving such efforts largely unjustifiable. Even if economic intervention does spur growth, specifically through World Bank loans, the result is often poorer countries being offered larger sums than they can pay back, leaving them with enduring debt. This is the cycle of African debt that has led to a subsequent economic crisis in the continent today.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention on the pretext of sovereignty-breaching military intervention, and doubtful economic measures, are largely indefensible given the myriad of long-term complications that arise from such actions. Even if intervention is limited to the humanitarian front, determining the best course of action to take often involves an excruciating balance between social and political considerations. While it remains necessary to occasionally intervene in times of distress, seeing foreign intervention as a cure-all solution to the world's deep-seated problems is to overestimate its efficacy and disregard its potential to cause more harm than good. The aim must instead be to evolve our systems to a place where societies can thrive without the need for external intervention."

            "human_gen_truncate": "succumb to populist pressure at the cost of effectiveness. Plato argues in 'The Republic' that it should be the captain who steers the ship, not the passengers, suggesting that it is unwise to let an educated majority decide on matters they have little experience in. This is especially true in countries like Thailand and DR Congo where the phenomenon of \"vote buying\" - a process in which votes for political candidates are secured by giving monetary incentives to those who are uneducated and in penury - is prevalent. This not only maligns the core principle of good democratic governance that rests on an educated and informed electorate, but also mars the value of the equality of representation by making political decisions a prerogative of the rich. Second, relying on the majority rule could lead to ineffective populist policies that hurt the growth of a nation. This can be demonstrated by a comparative analysis of two countries during the later decades of the previous century - India that depended on populist social welfare policies under the rule of the Gandhis and the Congress Party, and Mao's unpopular decisions (such as the heavy emphasis on capital good production, the one child policy, etc) in China. As a result, India continues to remain in the backwaters of economic success whereas China has succeeded in raising the mean standard of living for its citizens tremendously as reflected in the growth of its Human Development Index. Third, the majority tends to vote keeping personal interests, as opposed to the interests of the nation, in mind. This is evidenced by Donald Trump's win in the primaries and caucuses in Nevada and New Hampshire, among others, despite the fact that his xenophobic closed doors approach towards immigrants contradicts over fifty years of American immigration and foreign policy, once again out of self interest. Hence, the decisions of the majority should be viewed with suspicion and over-ridden by a \"good government\", if necessary.\nNext, the unequivocal support of the majority rule could disrupt the delicate fabric of international relations, resulting in complications and detriments for citizens nationwide. Take the case of the Russian annexation of Crimea, sovereign Ukrainian territory, simply because (as Russia puts it) 96% of Crimeans voted in favour of Russian unification in a national referendum. This unilateral action failed to consider that perhaps the argument of protecting majority interests cannot be used to justify the violation of agreements on the international level and infringe on border protocol. This annexation, clearly 'out-of-order', inspired the West to impose crippling sanctions on Russia, even on basic necessities like food, ultimately debilitating the Russian economy and causing great hostility between international superpowers, seen in Obama and Putin's bickering in the General Assembly. This led to unwarranted consequences not only for the citizens of Russia, but also those of other countries; gridlocks in the Security Council ostensibly led to the aggravation of the Syrian Civil war, owing to inaction by the international community. Blindly following the majority has the potential to antagonise members of the international community and hurt uninvolved parties. Any good government would thus not stand for such acts, in accordance with the \"Responsibility to Protect\" (R2P).\nLastly, the pursuit of majority-favouring policies may be detrimental to the society in the long run as they do not solve the problems faced by the majority at their roots. Policies of affirmative action, such as the New Economic Policy in Malaysia, under the Bumiputera ('sons of the soil') umbrella, has received much criticism for some say it only exacerbates the dire problem of economic growth. This is because it secures the interest of an ethnic majority, by paying the cost of future growth borne by all. Similarly, analysts in the United States have concluded that the affirmative action policies of the past decades in the field of education, such as lowering the barriers for women to get into colleges, have failed because the problem has simply reversed itself in the present day. Today, it is men who suffer from a disappointing 46% admission rate (compared to the 54% for women), suggesting that the problem continues to exist, if not exacerbated, just with a different demographic. Such policies that favour a majority laggard group are not only discriminatory and counterproductive to larger objectives of a nation, but also ineffective as they do little but change the demographic of the victims of unequal opportunity. By no metric can such policies symbolise good governance.\nIn conclusion, while putting the interests of the majority first is acceptable in principle, it paves the way for harmful political decisions that hurt the interests of all. A \"good government\" should not resort to blindly adopting such measures, but rather should implement checks and balances to prevent the tyranny of the majority constitutionally, committing to protecting human rights and act in accordance with international law. Only then can a government that protects the interests of the majority over those of the minority be considered a \"good government\".",

Moreover, ignoring minority interests can significantly harm those communities - leaving them in an economically disadvantaged position.\n\nA government that continuously prioritizes the interests of the majority breeds significant social inequalities which, in turn, can be harmful to the realization of sustainable development goals.

Minority groups, such as ethic, gender, and religious minorities, often bring diversity to the economy, diversifying the country\u2019s resources. A good government should always leverage minority talents and resources to create an equitable and inclusive society.\n\nIn conclusion, a good government should not always protect the interests of the majority. Instead, it should strike a balance, ensuring that the rights and interests of both majority and minority groups are upheld and protected. In this way, the government can achieve sustainable development and genuine social harmony. Every citizen should be treated equally in the eyes of the law, regardless of their race, religion, or economic standing.

Thirdly, the majority may fail to see the long-term consequences of their decisions, leading to short-sighted policies that harm future generations. While the majority rule may be valid in certain situations, such as choosing a leader or deciding on a public issue, it must be balanced against the need to protect the rights and interests of minorities, and be tempered by the government's responsibility to act in the best interests of all citizens, irrespective of their status or wealth.\nIn conclusion, while the majority rule may have its advantages in certain situations, it is not always appropriate for the government to prioritize the interests of the majority above those of minorities, or to assume that the majority is always qualified to make decisions for the country as a whole.

Derogation from a government's duty to protect minorities occurs in part because minority interests tend to be more nuanced than majority opinions, and hence, more vulnerable to being swept aside. As such, such a government may not possess a full understanding of the minority's concerns, which may result in policies that have long-term detrimental effects. Additionally, the majority's self-interest may take priority over the common good, which may lead to policies that favour short-term benefit over long-term success. Last but certainly not least, majorities are fickle; public opinion tends to change very quickly, and policies may be quickly abandoned after public opinion shifts. This fickleness may lead to policy whiplash, where governments  make policies that end up hurting both the majority and the minority.\nWhile the government must consider the interests of the majority, it must not do so at the expense of either human rights or the long-term wellbeing of all its citizens. A government that only protects the interests of the majority cannot be considered a \"good government\" in any sense. Instead, representative democracy must ensure that all voices are heard and that the government considers the interests of all its citizens, including minorities, in all policy decisions made. The aim of a government is not just to serve the whims of the majority but to improve the lives of all its citizens.

For example, in the United States, voting districts are redrawn every decade in order to preserve the leading party's majority; this has often resulted in ghettos being formed and minority groups being disenfranchised despite having the legal right to vote. Moreover, majority opinions are heavily influenced by media moguls and political elites who are often only interested in furthering their own interests. This adds to the likelihood of majoritarian decision-making resulting in policies that are inherently self-defeating.\nThe majority rule also leads to the divisive idea of the tyranny of the majority, a term coined by the philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville. The tyranny of the majority refers to the idea that the majority can, through democratic means, impose their will on minority groups. The tyranny of the majority can be seen in the current debates around same-sex marriage and assisted suicide, where religious beliefs and majority rule are at odds with minority beliefs and individual autonomy. This creates a moral dilemma in a country bound by a social contract between the government and its citizens named demoi-cracy which is bandwagoned by majority opinion at the expense of minority representation.\nIn conclusion, while some may argue that a good government should always place the interests of the majority before all else, such thinking can lead to gross violations of human rights and customary international law, whilst simultaneously penalising and ultimately reducing the power of the minority. Instead of pursuing majoritarian rule, governments must seek to govern with inclusivity, address the historical wrongs that have been committed against minority groups and make sure that the majority is suitably informed and qualified to make the decisions that will have the best possible outcome for society.

Ignorance is a feature of majority decisions, with a vital example found in the Brexit referendum where the ignorance of the electorate regarding the economic implications of leaving the European Union led to a 3% leave victory. The self-interested nature of such decisions is demonstrated by the case of the United States' withdrawal from the Paris Agreement on climate change, a decision taken despite scientific consensus on the urgency of combatting climate change. Such short sightedness is exemplified by Singapore's abolition of its Mandarin Medium Policy in education in 1987, despite its potential cross-border benefits, because of a vocal and influential minority that objected to it.\nIn conclusion, the unfettered protection of majority interests by a government is not a sound principle, from both a moral and utilitarian standpoint. Such thinking ignores the rights of minority groups, rests on a flawed assumption that the majority is qualified to make decisions, and may lead to detrimental decisions in the long run.

Short-term gains may be prioritised over long-term benefits, environmental and social responsibility may be compromised, and corruption and inequality may flourish.

Therefore, a good government must not always blindly follow the majority, but rather should consider expert opinion and rational analysis before deciding on policies that would benefit the country as a whole, not just the majority.\n\nTo conclude, while it may be principled or practical to believe that a good government should always protect the interests of the majority, it must be noted that the assumption that the majority is always qualified to make decisions may be flawed.

This is not confined to democracies, but even in authoritarian countries such as China, where the Communist Party justifies repression of ethnic minorities on the basis that it is in the national interest. Also, popular decisions cannot always be equated with the right ones. We have seen how the majority turned against the Jews in the lead up to the Second World War leading to the Holocaust and the Rwandans turning on the Tutsis at the turn of the century, hence revealing the fallacy that the majority is always right.\nTo conclude, it is apparent that the proposition that a good government should always protect the interests of the majority is a naive and misguided notion. Such a concept stems from a flawed assumption of a liquid majority-minority division and has the potential to lead to grave human rights violations. Additionally, the notion of a majority rule is only going to work if the majority is qualified to make decisions for the benefit of society as a whole.

While majority rule appears to be a fair and democratic way of governance, such notions must be examined in light of potential pitfalls. Rather, governments in the contemporary world should aim to pursue policies that both serve the interests of the majority and protect human rights and the rule of law in accordance with widely accepted international norms.

It is the rural people who are the most vulnerable to this disease since the lack of edu cation causes them to be ignorant of the ways of trans mission of AIDS.

The government has invested heavily in education, ensuring that schools have the necessary resources and teachers are adequately trained. There are also programs in place to provide financial assistance to families who cannot afford to send their children to school. As a result, Singapore's literacy rate is close to 100%.\nIn conclusion, I agree that education should be the primary concern of any government. A well-educated population is essential for a country's economic growth and success.

Many children have to work to support their families since their parents are themselves uneducated and unable to find a better job.\nHowever, if a government prioritises education, it can lead to great benefits. A well-educated population can be better equipped with skills for the job market, and this can translate into higher productivity. In turn, this can attract foreign investment and further promote economic growth. Education also instills values and promotes social mobility, reducing inequality in society. It can help to break the cycle of poverty and enable individuals to achieve their full potential.\nIn conclusion, while some governments may have different priorities, I strongly believe that education should be the first concern of any government.

As a result, the literacy rate in India is only at about 74% which is relatively low, considering that India has one of the largest populations in the world.\nOn the other hand, a country that places great emphasis on education is South Korea. Since the Korean War ended in 1953, South Korea has made giant strides and developed into an industrialised country. She attributes her success largely to education. The more educated the people are, the more skilled manpower they have and the more able they are to develop her economy. The government has poured vast amounts of money into education and research. This has resulted in an almost 100% literacy rate and a high-quality workforce. This high level of education has enabled South Korea to make great strides in technology, especially in the field of semi conductors and electronics. South Korea's success has made other countries look at education differently.\nIn conclusion, I fully agree with the view that education should be the primary concern of any government. Education provides the foundation for economic and social development. It is the only way to ensure long-term economic growth and the only means for the people to enjoy prosperity and happiness. However, as different countries have different priorities, it is up to them to determine which issues they need to address first.

Therefore, I believe that it is more important for the Indian government to prioritize education over defence spending.\nOn the other hand, Singapore\u2019s government sees education as its top priority. Singapore is a small island city-state with a population of about five million people, and with zero natural resources. From the 1960s, the Singapore government has been investing heavily in education, which has helped the country to rise from poverty to becoming a prosperous nation. Education has been a driving force in the country\u2019s economic success. Singapore today is the most developed country in Southeast Asia, with a per capita income that is among the highest in the world.\nIn conclusion, education should be a top priority for any government. A well-educated population will boost a country\u2019s economy and foster innovation. Defence and healthcare are also important, but education should not be compromised at their expense.

            "human_gen_truncate": "uent testing led to massive riotings and demonstrations.\nAs destructive as the splitting of a mere atom may be, it presents an alternative energy source other than petroleum and coal and yields more energy than can be harvested by solar power stations using current technology. Nuclear energy is currently being promoted as it is clean and does not directly pollute the environment and is relatively problem-free. The most important thing is that a whole city can be powered by just a few grammes of raw materials, instead of tons of petroleum or coal.\nHowever, as wonderful as nuclear power may be, there lies the danger of a nuclear meltdown. Experts say chances are very small due to the high level of caution exerted, seen in the precautions taken and the highly advanced technology used in harvesting nuclear energy. Despite all this, such a disaster did take place in the Chernobyl nu clear power station in the former Soviet Union in the 1980s. One of the nuclear reactors suffered a nuclear meltdown and exploded, causing massive destruction in areas of land around the station and sending a massive radioactive dust cloud throughout mainland Europe. more recent report said that a similar disaster was also narrowly avoided on Long Island in America.\nBesides the danger of a nuclear meltdown, another problem of nuclear power is the disposal of the radioactive waste. There is no way to completely dispose of the radioactive waste except to bury them in tightly-sealed containers underground and wait for the radioactivity of these materials to disappear, a process that normally takes thousands of years. Two dangers lie in this procedure. One is the threat of leakage and two, terrorists can easily steal the nuclear waste which are then sold away to countries as raw materials for nuclear weapons. The latter problem is currently surfacing as Russian mafia members are reportedly selling nuclear waste stolen from Ukraine to countries developing a nuclear arsenal. Another problem is the indiscriminate disposal of the nuclear waste. This problem was seen recently in a playground in Britain where radioactive materials were allegedly buried under it.\n20 Though it may seem that for every benefit brought by the splitting of the atom, there are many problems, there is one area where there are only benefits; the medical field. Radiation is used in radiotherapy used to treat cancer. X rays are also fully utilized by the medical field in diagnosis. As can be seen, this is one area where the splitting of the atom solely benefits man.\nAll in all, what is done has been done. The atom has been split by Man and there is no going back to what had been before. What can be done now is to ensure that no new problems will arise and the existing ones kept to a minimum. It is heartening to see Man using the problems to their advantage as in the case of nuclear weapons as deterrents, and much more can be done. Indeed, it is no time for Man to cry over spilt milk, as Pandora did after she opened the box, but to try to eradicate the problem caused by Man himself.",

Not only has this altered the geopolitical balance of power, but also fueled disputes between nations that could lead to a cataclysmic global war. It is undeniable that the spread of nuclear weapons has destabilized the whole international system.\n\nFurthermore, nuclear energy is not without its inherent dangers. Numerous nuclear disasters have been caused by accidents at nuclear plants, most notably Chernobyl and Fukushima. Such accidents have dire consequences for the environment and human health, with radioactivity that can remain harmful for generations. Additionally, the storage of nuclear waste remains a serious issue, and the long-term effects and ultimate disposal of nuclear waste on the environment and humankind remain unresolved.\n\nDue to the above-mentioned risks, many argue that we should not be pursuing nuclear energy as a power source or developing and stockpiling nuclear weapons. Instead, people should focus on the development of alternative, renewable energy sources as a means of generating electricity, which leads to lower emissions and new job opportunities. It is clear that the continued use of nuclear energy and the threat of nuclear arms war poses a significant risk to mankind.\n\nIn conclusion, the splitting of the atom has been both a gift and a curse. The discovery of nuclear energy has allowed us to unlock new scientific discoveries and implement cleaner sources of power. Yet, the atomic bomb has threatened the very existence of human civilization.

However, this is also a major cause of the rising unemployment levels in most developed countries.\nAlthough computers are important, it may not be true to say that modern life cannot function properly without computers. Firstly, for instance, computer games are very popular nowadays but do not always have to be part and parcel of life. More healthy forms of recreations such as sports can replace computer games.\nMoreover, although computers can improve communications there are also limitations, as computers lack the human touch. Although people can receive information through bulletin boards merely by sitting in front of a personal computer, each user will not be able to under stand the feelings of the other party since there are no face-to-face meetings. In the business world, meeting people is still very important as views and ideas can be transmitted in a more personal manner. The computer is only used when long distances hamper communications.\nEven in entertainment, where computers have created stunning multimedia effects (especially in animated movies), the skills of humanity are still needed. The better quality movies are created not by computers but through the hard work of the directors, actors and technical staff. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, robots and computers are only the tools of people. Research and development in design and product improvement come out of the minds of the individual designers. Moreover, creative products (such as jewellery) can never be manufactured through the use of computers since a unique identity is needed for each product.\nIn the field of police work, no one can deny the use fulness of computers in identifying fingerprints. Nevertheless, the work of experienced detectives in trying to understand motives and behaviour is most vital. In court, the essential task of convicting criminals still depends on the mind of a human judge.\nIn conclusion, it has to be emphasized that computers were invented by humans to perform certain tasks that humans have difficulty in doing. The decision-making and thinking processes can never be replaced by the computer as it cannot formulate its own opinion.

Mathematics is the great common language that everyone can make use of to communicate.\nHowever, we must take a look at ourselves before rushing out to propagate the binary gospel. Our brains function and work in a very different way from computers. Our brains process information simultaneously and in a parallel fashion, and when we think, we muddle along, groping around the edges of what we think we want, our neuron synapses firing furiously, and suddenly, voila! We hit upon an idea. This is what makes us capable of creative thought. Computers, however, pass information through a series of logic gates, filtering out what is not needed, before drawing on databanks to form a conclusion. We are also unable to communicate using numbers verbally. The whole structure of society would be upended if we did so. We are not able to communicate at the speed of our brain cells or computers, and as many ideas, when reduced to a string of numbers, would be extremely long, communication would get even more inefficient. Thus, we are not physically and mentally able to communicate directly in numbers.\nWe must therefore, use the right combination of phonetic and numerical languages to communicate.

However, much work still needs to be done, especially in getting to the root of the problem rather than curing the symptoms, and dealing with issues which tarnish Singapore\u2019s reputation, like corruption, and building stronger relations with the world.",
                "gum), censorship has been relieved to an extent and the government is slowly but surely opening up to criticisms and constructive feedback. The introduction of the Nominated Member of Parliament system and later the Non-Constituency MP scheme proved the government\u2019s willingness to listen to alternative voices, and not just the ruling party\u2019s. Moreover, the government\u2019s willingness to listen to public feedback was further enhanced with the creation of feedback channels and community involvement initiatives such as REACH, which creates a platform for Singaporeans to contribute towards national issues.\nDespite Singapore's high economic growth, social issues such as discrimination and inequality remain a key problem. Singapore is a multicultural country, which has at least four main races, and the government has always emphasised racial equality in the country\u2019s manifesto. However, social stratification has always been an issue in Singapore, where inequality exists not only between different races, but also between the rich and the poor; and the least educated and the most educated. This is further exacerbated by the presence of foreign domestic workers and PRC nationals who are largely employed in cleaning and menial jobs, and are seen as a lower class in Singapore. The government is aware of the issue and has responded to it by introducing ad-hoc relief measures such as the Workfare Income Supplement Scheme, which extends monetary aid to workers receiving low wages and promoting social mixing of students from different backgrounds, with the formation of the Committee on Strengthening Racial and Religious Harmony.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has performed creditably on issues affecting her interesting society, given the seriousness and complexity of some of the issues involved and the government\u2019s success in tackling them head-on. Nevertheless, more needs to be done in some areas and the government should involve her people more actively in coming up with solutions to such problems. Ultimately, the success in tackling all aspects of her challenges depends on a continued concerted effort from the government and people of Singapore towards a shared destiny and vision.",

Singapore has also tackled corruption, \u2018been a trait common in developing countries, but has been successful in curbing it through the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), which has been effective in arresting bribe-givers and bribe-takers. Singapore\u2019s political system has also been lauded and awarded by watchdogs such as Transparency International, where Singapore emerged as one of the cleanest countries in the world. However, Singapore\u2019s mindset as a nanny state where government has a say in many aspects of our lives needs to change and make Singaporeans more proactive and take responsibility for their own choices. In this aspect, Singapore needs more political transparency and open dialogue between government and the people.\nIn the social aspect, Singapore has issues such as racial disharmony, the rise of extremist elements and the increasing divide between the rich and poor. Singapore has touted herself to be a model of racial harmony, with Malays, Chinese, Indians and Eurasians living together amicably in dormitory estates. However, the rise of religious extremism has caused government unease with external groups trying to disrupt Singapore\u2019s multi-racial, multi-religious harmony.\nFurthermore, the increasing gap between the rich and poor has caused concern as Singaporeans feel they are being left behind. Hence initiatives such as Workfare, where Singaporeans in lower income brackets are aided with cash and training, have been successful in empowering and reducing the income gap between the poor and rich. Singapore has also tried to foster a caring society with initiatives such as \u201cSpend a day with a family in need\u201d as a platform to encourage social cohesion in Singapore. However, Singapore still has room for improvement in addressing these social issues, as Singaporeans need to learn to reach out and interact with each other in different social settings.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made significant strides in tackling the political, economic and social issues she is facing, but there is still work to be done through dialogues and feedback channels from Singaporeans. Singapore needs to remain vigilant, resilient and proactive in tackling the next set of challenges as she strives to progress in this 21st century.",

However, there are still areas that require improvement, such as ensuring transparency in government policies, as seen in the recent saga of the termination of the administrator of the National University of Singapore Confucius Institute. Furthermore, the current influx of immigrants has caused tension among citizens, leading to resentment and xenophobia. While Singapore boasts of being a melting pot of cultures, locals feel that foreigners are taking their jobs and causing overcrowding. The government has stepped in to address their concerns, by tightening immigration policies and regulating foreign labour quotas, but again, these policies may not be effective in tackling the root of the issue, as shown in recent surveys where respondents feel that the government does not listen to their feedback.\nUltimately, I feel that while Singapore has been relatively successful in addressing the significant issues facing her, there is still room for improvement. The government should not just aim to cure the symptoms of the problems, but actively seek the opinions of Singaporeans, to tackle the root cause of the issues and thereby achieve sustained success in resolving them.",

Prior to the 2011 General Election, Singapore also saw more opposition party members in parliament, signifying that Singapore has become more politically mature and accepting of dissenting views. However, there are still areas where the government needs to improve on, such as the repeal of the Internal Security Act (ISA), which allows for indefinite detention without trial of alleged threats to internal security. While the ISA has been a useful tool to combat threats to Singapore\u2019s internal security, there have been calls for its repeal, as it threatens civil liberties and human rights. Hence, the government still needs to address these pertinent issues and achieve a balance between security and freedom. Overall, Singapore has done well in balancing these aspects but still has room for improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has made significant strides in tackling various issues, there are still areas where improvement is needed. As a small island nation with limited resources, Singapore has been innovative and proactive in seeking out solutions to its problems. However, the government needs to constantly listen to the people, seek their feedback, and improve upon their policies. Only then can Singapore truly overcome the challenges she faces today and continue to prosper in the future.",

Furthermore, the government has been actively wooing top civil servants from other countries to provide a fresh perspective to policies. While critics may argue that the political opposition is still marginalized and the media is still tightly controlled, these apparent faults have not detracted Singapore from her growth, which shows that the political aspect of Singapore is manageable and well in control.\nHowever, Singapore still has social issues that need addressing too. The issue of population is again brought up, particularly through the influx of a high number of immigrants over the past few years. It is not that Singapore is hostile towards immigrants, but that they are worried about the impact of the economic downturn on jobs and resultant xenophobic tendencies. Furthermore, the issue of social stratification has also taken on greater importance since the late 1990s. Singapore\u2019s Gini coefficient measures social inequality, and since then, it has risen from 0.42 to 0.47 in 2002, almost as high as the USA\u2019s 0.473. While some may argue that this is not necessarily a bad thing as it provides a competitive edge for all strata, the government has also intensified measures to benefit the low-income group through initiatives such as the Workfare Income Supplement, which aims to encourage participation of low-income workers and the provision of foreign worker\u2019s levies being channelled to training courses for locals. There has also been increased stress on value consensus and a common Singapore identity to prevent further social stratification.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has come a long way to where she is today, with problems that are unique to her society and government. Singapore should thus continue her proactive stance on identifying current and future issues, and taking immediate action instead of just curing the symptoms. Singaporeans themselves have a significant role such as participating actively in the political process, and accepting the responsibility for managing a country. It is only through such cooperation that Singapore can be assured a brighter future and continue to successfully tackle significant issues facing her today.",

However, the government still faces criticism for her stringent control over civil liberties and curbing political dissent, with the most recent case against the socio-political website, The Online Citizen (TOC). Advocates of greater freedom of speech and how democracy ought to function argue that Singapore\u2019s lack of riots in times of political and economic hardship, have made her leaders complacent and fearful of open political debates and transition to greater democracy. Nevertheless, while Singapore may not be a perfect political entity, she has been successful in maintaining a relatively stable political system, without much upheaval and ensuring that the country goes on with its daily business.\nTo summarise, Singapore has tackled her political, economic and social issues relatively successfully. While some problems remain unresolved and may require rethinking from another perspective, the unity and foresight of the government have ensured that we remained as one of the most conducive nations in South-East Asia.",

The Internet provides a platform for Singaporeans to express their views and the Government has set up REACH, the government feedback unit, to hear the views of the people more effectively. The government has also recognised the need for greater transparency and has been releasing more information about governmental decisions, such as the timing of GST hikes. Nevertheless, the political issue of censorship still remains a hot topic in Singapore and a point of contention between the government and its people. Critics argue that censorship restricts freedom of speech and freedom of press, while the government sees it as necessary to maintain social cohesion and stability in multi-racial and multi-religious Singapore. Nonetheless, the government has been actively reviewing its censorship policies and lifting bans on controversial books and films, such as the movie \u201cTo Singapore, with Love\u201d. This shows that the government is willing to listen to feedback and make changes when necessary to maintain its relevance and popularity with Singaporeans.\nIn conclusion, while Singapore has been successful in tackling significant issues to a certain extent, there is always room for improvement. Singapore has always been a nation that prides itself on its pragmatism and adaptability to change. As the challenges facing Singapore grows increasingly complex, the government must continue to listen to the needs and views of its people, and work towards sustainable solutions that will ensure Singapore\u2019s continued success and prosperity.",

Perhaps one of the most significant issues Singapore faces politically is the 2011 General Election, where the opposition party, for the first time in Singapore\u2019s history, captured over 30% of the popular votes in a significant breakthrough. This suggests that Singaporeans, while still appreciating the stability and phenomenal growth their guardian government has provided, may be ready to entertain a two-party system in the near future. Further, Singapore is known for its strict laws and regulations, sometimes to the point where they may restrict freedom of speech and expression. The government has relooked and revamped many of them, including lifting the restriction on political films on the internet, while ensuring that the unique fabric and harmony of the Singapore nation remains intact.\nFinally, Singapore faces social issues, such as an increasingly stratified society. Some say that the Singapore dream is no longer an attainable one, as the income gap has widened and the rich keep getting richer while the poor get poorer. Singapore has tried to bridge this gap, by offering financial assistance to lower-income families and by promoting equal opportunities in education, regardless of socio-economic backgrounds. Undoubtedly, Singapore\u2019s generous bursaries and aid schemes have helped many students from lower-income families to score well in major examinations, enter prestigious universities and better their lives. However, Singapore still faces criticism that the poor get a raw deal, as they are disqualified from certain governmental schemes and are often viewed as the less successful ones by society. While Singapore has done well in fighting this issue, perhaps more could be done to raise social awareness of the plight of the less successful in Singapore and to remind Singaporeans of the society we would like to be.\nIn conclusion, while there are significant issues Singapore faces today, the government has been relatively successful in tackling these issues and ensuring the progress and prosperity of the nation. However, as Singapore progresses, many issues, some new and unforeseen, may arise. Singapore\u2019s adaptability and the determination of Singaporeans in facing challenges and solving major problems will always be key in ensuring Singapore\u2019s continued success as a nation."

The government has implemented the Housing Development Board (HDB) system where affordable housing is provided for the vast majority of citizens. Due to the scarcity of land, the solution was to build high-rise apartments and flats, which have turned Singapore into one of the most densely populated cities in the world. However, rising HDB resale prices and the surge in private property prices have impacted Singapore's housing affordability, with government measures implemented to curb price hikes and to increase the supply of affordable housing.\n\nLastly, Singapore has been praised for its successful economic policies, propelling it to be one of the wealthiest nations in the world.

The government has also introduced schemes such as the Home Improvement Programme (HIP) to help upgrade older flats and make them more livable. Additionally, the country has introduced various BTOs with eco-friendly features, such as solar panels, rainwater harvesting, and community gardens, making them more sustainable.

As part of a comprehensive 'Housing for All' policy, Singapore has made a significant effort in providing affordable housing. The government has taken the initiative to build subsidized housing estates, enabling citizens of Singapore to take up opportunities regardless of their socioeconomic status. One of the significant housing policies of Singapore is the Home Ownership Plan (HDB), providing homeowners with a choice to lease or purchase their flats, allowing individuals to have a stake in the economy. By improving the housing conditions of individuals, Singapore has created a sense of ownership, belonging and identity, contributing to a stable and prosperous population.\n\nLastly, Singapore has tackled the issue of the economy. Singapore has created an environment that encourages entrepreneurship, innovation, and international trade. The country has developed a skilled labor force suitable for sectors such as manufacturing, finance, and technology, attracting foreign investment and business opportunities. Additionally, being a hub for international trade, Singapore has developed trade relationships with major economies worldwide, providing business opportunities for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Despite challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, Singapore has progressed in its effort to improve the economy by diversifying the economy to reduce its reliance on the country's traditional industries and increasing the country's investment in automation and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made significant strides towards tackling challenges facing the country today.

With limited available land, the government has introduced various schemes to help its citizens afford property. These schemes include housing grants, government-built public housing, and policies that balance housing prices and availability. While these initiatives have allowed Singaporeans to own homes, critics argue that not enough housing is being built to keep up with demand. Despite that, Singapore's housing policies have generally achieved the aim of ensuring residents have homes to call their own.\n\nLastly, Singapore has made remarkable progress in its economy. The country's open and trading economy has been the cornerstone of its growth and success. Singapore ranks as one of the top countries in the world based on the ease of doing business. This is due to a widespread culture of entrepreneurship and favorable government policies towards startups, including access to capital, incubation programs, and tax incentives. Singapore has worked to maintain a low unemployment rate and provide jobs to the majority of its workforce.

Raffles knew that this could develop into a major problem if left unchecked and thus told the Town Committee that \u201cthe proper allotment of the native divisions of the town\u201d was necessary. He set about building parallel roads which were lined with properly numbered houses. Different dialect groups were al located to different \u201ckampongs\u201d. For example, the Hokkiens, merchants and carpenters went to live at Amoy and Telok Ayer Streets while the Cantonese, tailors and goldsmiths, lived at Temple, Pagoda and Mosque Streets. This meticulous planning of Raffles helped our leaders to recognise the importance of planning and organising for the population and hence explains the orderly housing estates in Singapore now.\nThe final appealing factor of this period is the fact that this was the time when most of our ancestors from China, Thailand and India migrated to Singapore in search of better-paid jobs. They, being the pioneers of Singapore, worked and slogged all day for a better living. With out them, we would not be what we are today. Our ancestors encountered all sorts of hardships and built our nation from scratch. Every inch of our land is the fruit of their labour and much sweat and blood of theirs have been sacrificed for us. All these serve as a motivation for us that anything is possible and every goal is attainable as long as we are willing to work hard for it. Their hard work has given us a good head-start in growing to be a thriving nation.\nAll the above reasons explain why this period of history appeals to me.

These HDB flats became the focal point of social cohesion and community building.\n\nIn conclusion, the period of Singapore's industrialization is appealing to me because of how much it transformed the country. It was a period of tremendous growth, innovation, and progress that propelled Singapore to become the modern and developed country it is today. The Singapore government's visionary policies, coupled with the resilience and adaptability of the Singaporean people, proved that a small country like Singapore could achieve great things with the right mindset and determination.",

It was a time of rapid progress, innovation, and transformation, marked by a strong government vision, effective policies, and the resilience and hard work of its people. The period saw Singapore rise from a third-world country struggling with its independence to a first-world country with a thriving economy and a standard of living that's among the best in the world.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ty. The impact of this has been to try to address the question of values in schools and in the media.\nDespite concerns about selfishness, the impact of the media has been such, that periodically Singaporeans reach out to the world in an altruistic way-e.g. sending aid to earthquake victims. On an institutional level the Singapore police have taken on peacekeeping duties in Namibia while the Singapore International Foundation sends concerned professionals on voluntary service stints to places like Nepal. Such efforts are laudable and enable Singapore to feel a certain pride in its role in the world, which goes beyond pride in economic achievement.\nLike any other country plugged into the world, Singapore has increasingly sought to make its voice heard in the international community. Professor Tommy Koh, for example, was Chairman of the Rio UN Conference on the Environment. P.M. Goh, recently, did battle in the USA over Singapore\u2019s political system. Being part of the global village increasingly means not only a greater role but a need to assert one\u2019s position when one comes under scrutiny.\nSingapore is a cosmopolitan society and increasing numbers of different racial groups are coming here to live and work and have fun. Tourist arrivals continue to go up and Singaporeans have benefited again in terms of jobs, but also in terms of using facilities developed to maintain tourist interest in Singapore e.g. the Night Safari. Increasingly too, foreign workers or rather, foreign talent are to be found living here. These are not just the expatriates but those who have been moved here, because they have desirable skills, with offers of P.R. status e.g. Indian computer analysts and Hong Kong media people. Thus the talent pool is expanded.\nWith increased affluence Singaporeans seek modern forms of entertainment. With improved air transport and communications, more international arts events are being seen here. At the same time this would appear to have galvanised local arts groups to be more professional, more ambitious and more competitive. As such the Arts scene is considerably more vibrant than it was when Singaporeans themselves saw their country as a \u201ccultural desert\u201d.\nFinally, as part of the global village, Singapore is not immune from some of its uglier aspects. Amongst these are Internet porn, the influence of international drug rings and crime syndicates (e.g. South America thieving rings)",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "ngaporeans for positions.\n\nAnother negative aspect of globalization that Singapore has experienced is the impact on its traditional cultures. As the country moves towards a more globalized world, it has become increasingly westernized, erasing its traditional roots. This has led to a lack of interest among young Singaporeans in their culture, history and traditions. There has also been an increase in the consumption of western culture, leading to a homogenization of world culture. As Singaporeans become increasingly influenced by international cultures, they may forget their own histories.\n\nFurthermore, the global nature of Singapore's economy has facilitated environmental degradation. Singapore\u2019s environment has been impacted by the increase in global demand. The country has become a centre for international business, which has led to speedier industrialization. The result is an increase in pollution, loss of greenery, and destruction of natural habitats. With global warming becoming an increasingly pressing issue, Singapore must seek environmentally sustainable practices. While the government has made efforts to increase awareness of environmental issues and promote sustainable practices, these are not enough to overcome the negative effects of globalization on the environment.\n\nIn conclusion, globalization has had both positive and negative impacts on Singapore. The country's economy has grown, creating new business and employment opportunities. However, Singapore's global reach has also led to vulnerability, putting the country's businesses and people in danger. Moreover, globalization has also led Singapore to become more westernized, erasing its traditional roots, and negative environmental consequences.

Singapore must navigate these challenges carefully and maintain a balance between progress and stability to ensure a sustainable future.",

Additionally, Singapore\u2019s small size and vulnerable position in the region means it has to be aware of possible new global threats and new fashions, be they economic, technological or political.

Cultural differences and language barriers can lead to conflicts, and those who feel left behind by Singapore\u2019s transformation can experience resentment or even alienation.\nNonetheless, it is undeniable that the global village has brought Singaporeans many benefits. Singaporeans have access to a global network of ideas that enhances innovation and creativity. The ability to connect, collaborate, and share knowledge with people worldwide has opened up new opportunities, not just for businesses but also for individuals. Singaporeans can learn from others\u2019 experiences, build networks, and participate in a global community that fosters exchange and dialogue. As a result, many Singaporeans are more open-minded and cosmopolitan than they might have been a generation ago.

Singapore, as a nation of immigrants, has always been culturally diverse. But Singaporeans are now perhaps more aware of the world\u2019s diversity than at any time in their history. They can sample Indonesian, Thai, Chinese and Western foods all in one day if they wish. But, on the negative side, Singaporeans are also increasingly vulnerable to the ubiquitous cultures of the global media \u2013 American television, movies, and music. Some people feel that Singaporeans are losing touch with their own culture. However, these negative cultural impacts are often weak to non-existent. Singapore\u2019s unique cultural make-up has proved itself very resistant to cultural incursion. People also have the capacity to choose what they want to be influenced by and what is not useful to them.\nIn sum, being part of the global village has had very materialistic benefits for Singapore, although there are drawbacks too. However, on a cultural level, being part of the global village has enriched the cultural diversity of Singapore.

Understanding and managing such cultural diversity will become more crucial as Singapore continues to integrate into the global community.\nIn conclusion, the impact of the world becoming a global village on Singapore has been significant, both economically and socially.

Promotion of local literature and arts, ensuring the use of standard English and the speaking of Mandarin are among the measures taken. This helps inculcate a sense of belonging and identity among Singaporeans.\nIn conclusion, the impact of the global village on Singapore has been both positive and negative.

There are also more opportunities for Singaporeans to study and travel abroad, which broadens their horizons and exposes them to new ideas and ways of thinking. However, some may argue that this has led to a loss of Singaporean identity and culture.\n\nIn conclusion, the impact of the global village on Singapore has been both beneficial and detrimental.

One is now able to access great amounts of information without ever needing to leave one\u2019s chair, with the Internet and world webs are becoming even more popular, easy to use and well-stocked. Even the traditional text book has given way to learning through the computer with each student learning at his or her own speed behind a personalised learning terminal. The speed, convenience and space saving capabilities of computers should spell the death throes of the humble book but the computer too has its share of failings that allow the book to survive.\nHardware is expensive, as many computer enthusiasts would say, and thus replacing all books with computers and disks would be highly expensive and not feasible until Technology lowers the price further. Many poor people in Third World countries can hardly afford books, let alone computers, thus efforts should be placed to give books to such places and not seek to over modernise our already advanced world. Books remain, at the moment, the cheapest method of teaching in more backward areas of the globe and this would remain important for a long time to come. Besides, the cost of the actual machines money too has to be spent on training people to use such hardware. All this reinforces the books\u2019 ease of use and simplicity that makes early teaching so much easier.\nThus, books do have a foreseeable future and would not be made redundant, at least not the way things are now. Though Information Technology presents us with much potential, it will be a long time before it is fully tapped and even then will not completely make the book redundant. Many say that perhaps old books have more of a future, that the old antique volumes stand a greater chance of survival as museum exhibits.

Many people still enjoy the tactile experience of holding a book and the aesthetic appeal of a well-designed cover.\n\nFurthermore, multiple benefits of printed books cannot be found in digital books. For instance, books can be more aesthetically pleasing, especially rare editions with customized illustrations and leather-bound covers. Each book can have its own unique design that complements its content. Physical books are also easier to lend, borrow or share with friends, fostering a sense of community amongst readers. With this, books are still the best way to preserve memories of real-life events like book signings, holidays, or dedications inscribed in them.\n\nTo summarize, books still possess a bright future despite the increasing popularity of digital media. Printed books will always be a source of knowledge and enjoyment, as well as being an outlet for self-reflection. Digital books are a faster and more convenient way of obtaining books, and they are useful for on-the-go reading. Nevertheless, traditional books remain more popular, especially in the academic and literary community. As long as there is a demand for books, they will continue to exist.

            "human_gen_truncate": "mind, and guided by the author, the setting, the character, the sounds the whole tapestry along which the story runs is woven from the fabric of one\u2019s imagination, which is more vivid and thrilling than any film can ever be. No doubt, Peter Jackson\u2019s remarkable interpretation of Tolkien\u2019s \u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 delighted many, but perhaps one who had read the books was expecting Middle Earth to look more, well, medieval? The way a book opens itself to interpretations also makes reading again more exciting and worthwhile, as a story is rarely read the same way twice.\nThis aspect of interpretation also limits the scope of films, giving yet more reason to continue reading. A film is based on the director\u2019s interpretation of the book, as illustrated by the \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019 example. This fact, along with the nature of films to be mere adaptations of books, means one can never take away the complete experience of reading from watching a film. What is more, the director may produce a distorted or objectionable interpretation, such as in the case of Lee Ang\u2019s \u2018The Hulk\u2019, which many long-time followers of the comic book disapproved of.\nAnother limitation of a film is that very often it cannot portray certain emotional undertones in a book, nor can it accurately convey the mood or ambience the author might have intended. An actor might be excellent at producing a pained look, complete with that half-wince and barely visible shivering of lips, but he still will not able to show \u2018his heart is cracking\u2019 or \u2018pain gripped his lungs\u2019. Mel Gibson\u2019s controversial \u2018The Passion of Christ\u2019 is an example of how a film is unable to reproduce the transient, spiritual nature of the text it is adapted from, as well as how the power of words is open to a myriad of interpretations.\nFurthermore, reading will always be practical. The improving and development of one\u2019s language, and the convenience of pulling out a book and putting it down as and when one desires, have nothing to do with tradition. Reading is a way to pass the time while improving yourself at the same time \u2013 a language workout, some might call it and you can pause whenever you want to.\nTherefore, even though films may appear superior to books, and reading is redundant, one only needs to consider the value of reading to realize that films can never replace the experience of reading. In fact, films often draw attention to the books they were adapted from, such as \u2018Seabiscuit\u2019 and \u2018Lord of the Rings\u2019. The purpose of such films should be to complement one\u2019s reading experiences, to make the story more complete in a tangible manner. Reading, in itself, is still very much a necessary and practical action that opens up a wealth of possibilities.",

Readers crawl into the mind of the protagonist or the antagonist, which can help us develop a connection with them. In comparison, movies are limited in the amount of time they can spend on the character\u2019s persona and development. This is why reading will always be a more comprehensive and satisfying experience than watching the same story on the silver screen.\n\nAdditionally, reading books increases one's vocabulary compared to watching movies. Books expose readers to new words, expressions, and writing styles, which can be challenging but rewarding at the same time. By incorporating these new words into one's vocabulary, they can improve their communication skills, written and verbal communication, and enhance their capacity for critical thinking and analysis.\n\nFurthermore, the process of reading can be therapeutic and relaxing, and it allows one to escape the distractions of modern society. Reading a book can be a refreshing break from the digital deluge that we face in today's world. Even just 20 minutes of reading every day can help clear the mind and reduce stress levels. As a result, reading is a more effective stress-reliever than watching a movie.\n\nTo conclude, the availability of books that have been adapted into movies, should not decrease the value of reading. Reading is an essential skill which contributes to personal growth and development, intellectual curiosity and imagination which cannot be compromised. Reading is an active engagement that promotes creativity, deep thinking, and cognitive development, which can never be matched by any form of entertainment.

Reading also helps us to improve vocabulary and reading skills, which are important in our personal and professional development.\nIn conclusion, while films certainly offer a different and appealing experience compared to books, I believe that reading will always be necessary. Films may capture what is in the book, but they can never fully capture all of the book. Books provide intellectual stimulation, imagination, and knowledge that is simply irreplaceable. It is up to each of us to decide how to balance our time between reading and watching films, but one should never underestimate the power of a good book.",

Certain characters and scenes are not included in the final cut, either because of time constraints or technical feasibility. A prime example would be \u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 book series by J.R.R. Tolkien, which was adapted into a film trilogy. While the films were able to capture the essence of the story, several key scenes and characters were left out, such as Tom Bombadil and the Barrow-wights.\nUltimately, while films are a great way to enjoy stories, they can never fully replace the experience of reading. The magic of flipping through the pages, imagining the story characters and scenes in one's mind, and having the freedom to interpret a story in one's own way is an experience that cannot be replicated.

These facets provide insight into the human experience that films cannot replicate.\nFurthermore, reading is a mental exercise and an active one \u2013 it engages readers and forces them to think and use their brains. It challenges one\u2019s vocabulary, increases one\u2019s intelligence and knowledge, and broadens perspectives. Films, by contrast, can leave little to the imagination, and do not necessarily stimulate critical thinking.\nIt is also worth mentioning that book adaptations do have their limitations, and they may not be as faithful to the story compared to the original work. Scenes may be omitted, or character development may be neglected due to time constraints, or simply the director\u2019s vision of the story may be different from the author\u2019s. Meanwhile, reading the original work allows one to engage with the author\u2019s original intent and immerse oneself in the world the author created.\nIn conclusion, while film adaptations of books may be entertaining, they cannot completely replace the experience of reading.

The images and sounds created are not restricted to computer-generated images or the boundaries of a screen. This power to imagine is something that is in decline in our visual world, and reading helps us sharpen and exercise this ability.\nFurthermore, reading can improve language and cognitive skills, such as critical thinking or analysis, something that watching a film can never achieve. It\u2019s the ability to go back, reread a section, pause and reflect on the material that makes books uniquely instructional. Reading familiarizes oneself with different viewpoints and perspectives, helps one develop a better understanding of the world, and improves empathy, thereby making one more thoughtful and conscious of others around oneself.\nTo summarise, while films may provide a more lustrous, grander experience, the habit of reading will not be extinguished. Reading has always been and always will be more than merely a narrative laid out, it is an essential part of human experience that requires cognitive demands and discipline that is not found in today\u2019s visual medium.

This allows the reader to gain insights and connect more deeply with the story than simply watching a film could.\nMoreover, reading can be seen as a more intellectual and thought-provoking activity than watching films. Reading requires attention, focus and concentration \u2013 all traits that are beneficial to one\u2019s cognitive development.

Reading provides a different, but equally compelling experience to that offered by films. Reading allows the imagination to flourish and fosters cognitive development and learning. Ultimately, the choice between reading and films depends on one\u2019s preferences, but for the discerning reader, the delights of a good book will always have an irreplaceable charm that cannot be replicated on the screen.",

Unlike films, where dialogue is delivered at an audible pace, books allow readers to slow down and process language continuously and deliberately. Reading books allows one to gain a deeper understanding of language and how language works.\nIn conclusion, while the trend of adapting books into films may give rise to the thought that reading is no longer necessary, books still provide a unique experience that films cannot. Reading fosters imagination, provides a vast wealth of titles to choose from, and allows for personalisation of stories.

Often, such details are not possible to capture in a film. Though films may attempt to depict the thoughts and emotions of the characters through their expressions and actions, it is just an imitation of what the book offers in abundance.\nIn conclusion, while films are a tantalising lure in this fast-paced digital world, reading remains a crucial element of knowledge acquisition, imaginative development, and character building. It has its unique strengths and will always find its loyal patrons. Though books and films serve different purposes in art and entertainment, I firmly believe that reading will always have its distinct audience, who will continue to appreciate its beauty and the marvels it brings to their lives.",

Additionally, reading helps to boost one\u2019s cognitive abilities, such as analytical thinking, empathy, and problem-solving skills. It is a great way to keep the mind sharp and to continuously learn new things.\nIn conclusion, while films of book adaptations are definitely popular and entertaining, reading should not be neglected or underestimated, for the wealth of knowledge and imagination it brings.

Consider this case in World War II: a German woman lied to her nation\u2019s soldiers to conceal five Jews who had taken residence in her house, because she knew what happened to Jews when they were caught \u2013 even at the risk of her own family. The ends: Five lives were spared endless torture and eventual painful death. It is very hard to say this woman\u2019s lies were not justified \u2013 lives are highly significant ends. In fact, our army trains our soldiers to lie in the event that they become prisoners of war. Not only would we justify the lies of soldiers who endured for the sake of their people; we would glorify their obdurate lying!\nYet, not everyone agrees that \u2018the end justifies the means\u2019 in the event of political propaganda. Governments always claim their motives are good- and sometimes even the end results are good, yet even in the face of such evidence of benefits, there is resentment if people feel they were tricked by lies (or manipulation of the truth) on the part of the government. The bottom line is that people do not like to be deceived and will feel cheated even if you did it for their own good. For these people, the ends which may well include higher standards of living, improved facilities, high employment, do not justify their loss of personal freedom and choice when they were not told the total truth and could not make informed decisions. (Funnily, nowadays, the concept of \u2018delayed truth\u2018 is in.)\nIt may be better to assess motives to see if a lie is justifiable, since lying is a moral issue and motives are very much linked to morals. In the practical world, if a lie doesn\u2019t seem to lead to anything worthwhile, it may not be justifiable. But on the moral level, lying when done out of true compassion and a conscious need to do what is right, is justifiable, no matter what the ends are or whether the lie succeeds in doing what it was intended to do. Very likely lying will lead to pain because it is a dangerous and complicated tool \u2013 but many of us still lie knowing that because it is an abstract concept. Sometimes it seems kinder to lie than tell the truth when we rationalise a real life situation. Even a person who is hurt by your lies may forgive you when it is clear your intentions are good, because pure motives are a universal language, recognised instantly and instinctively in a way that all the rationalizing in the world to justify any deed cannot do.\nLet us ask ourselves why there is this inherent need to justify lying \u2013 isn\u2019t it because on some level we recognize that lying is a potentially harmful thing which we have no right to truly wield because it is in a sense playing with other people\u2019s lives without their permission? The need to justify\u2026 reflects the need to be forgiven, by not only those we implicate by our lies, but also ourselves. We all want to know we have tried our best to do what we think is most right. And it is this desire that will continue making lies justifiable.",

Hence, telling a white lie in such a situation may be an act of kindness.\n\nMoreover, lying may be justified in certain circumstances where it can lead to a greater good. For example, if a journalist is covering a story that exposes a corrupt public official, the journalist may have to lie to protect their sources from retribution. In such cases, lying may be ethically justified if it serves the public interest, and the greater good is achieved in the process.\n\nHowever, it is essential to note that these situations are exceptions rather than the rule. Lying should not be a regular practice in our daily lives, and the exceptions illustrated above are limited. If lying becomes habitual, it could result in a mistrustful and anxious society that is incapable of relating honestly and openly. Therefore, the incidence of lying must not be taken lightly.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of whether lying can ever be justified is a complex one. While dishonesty can be harmful, destructive, and erode trust, in certain situations, it can be necessary and morally acceptable. If lying is necessary to prevent harm or avoid hurting someone's feelings, then it may be justified. However, we must be aware of the consequences and limit justified lying to exceptional circumstances. In the end, honesty is the best policy, and we should aspire towards being truthful people who cherish integrity and transparency in all areas of our lives.",

                "ply that any means are acceptable as long as the results are satisfactory. However, in reality not all ends can justify every means, especially if the means employed are unethical or illegal. For instance, if a politician lies and manipulates public opinion to win an election, this cannot be justified, even if he does it with the aim of helping his community. Yet in cases such as hiding information from someone who may not be able to handle it, the end of protecting them may justify the means of lying.\nExamining motive is another way to determine the justifiability of lies. A lie that is told with the intention of causing harm to someone else is never justifiable, even if it may seem the most convenient option at the time. Lies that are told for altruistic reasons may have a better chance of being justified; for instance, a lie that protects someone else's feelings or prevents them from being harmed.\nIn conclusion, it is difficult to make a blanket statement that all lies are unjustifiable, and that no one should ever tell a lie. However, it is essential to bear in mind that lying carries moral weight and that the reasons for telling a lie should be carefully considered before committing to it. The ends should not always justify the means, and motives must be examined. While \u201cwhite lies\u201d may be acceptable in some situations, lies that compromise relationships or hurt others are never justifiable. Ultimately, it is up to each individual to weigh the consequences when deciding to tell a lie.",
                "ply that it is acceptable to employ any means to achieve an end goal. However, this is not necessarily the case. In terms of lies, the end must be considerate and ethical; it should be an end that is noble or is aimed at the greater good. For example, if lying about someone else's whereabouts can prevent a dangerous crime from being committed, then it might be justified. In this case, lying is seen as a necessary evil, a lesser evil to the greater evil that might result if no action is taken.\nOn the other hand, examining motive implies that the reason why someone is telling a lie must be sincere, uncontaminated by ulterior motives. If someone is lying to protect another person from harm or to save someone's dignity, then it might be a justifiable lie.\nIn conclusion, while telling lies is generally not justifiable, there are situations where it can perhaps be excused. However, lying must be undertaken with caution, and the consequences carefully weighed. In any case, lying should not be chosen as the first resort in dealing with any situation.",
                "ply that as long as the end result is desirable, any means to it is acceptable. Such an attitude may overlook the fact that achieving something through dishonorable means may tarnish any good that comes from it. Furthermore, there may be alternative means to achieve the same goals which do not involve lying.\nExamining the motive behind lying can be a more sound method. If the intention is to cause harm or benefit oneself at another's cost, then it is unethical and unjustifiable. However, if the motive is to protect someone from harm, prevent damage or to spare people unnecessary pain without jeopardizing anyone else, then it may be justifiable. It still does not change the fact that a lie is still a lie and must be evaluated in terms of the long-term repercussions.\nThere are no absolute rules governing the ethics of lying and it is a difficult question to answer, but in general, honesty should be the foundation of human relationships, upon which trust and respect can be built. The benefit of telling the truth far outweighs any temporary discomfort or unpleasantness to be confronted by being truthful.",
                "ply that if the outcome of an act is good, then the act itself is good regardless of the means used to achieve it. This idea can be used as a guide in the decision-making process regarding whether a lie is justified or not. If the end result of telling a lie is a greater good for society or the people involved, then lying may be justified. For example, if a doctor lies to a terminally-ill patient about their prognosis in order to keep their spirits up and give them hope for recovery, the end result may be seen as justified. However, this is still a complex issue that requires careful consideration.\n\nMotive is another factor to consider when deciding whether a lie can be justified. If the motive behind the lie is pure and selfless, such as protecting someone from harm, then the lie may be justified. For instance, if a parent tells their child a white lie about the existence of Santa Claus in order to preserve their innocence and joy, then the lie may be morally acceptable.\n\nHowever, while it is possible to find situations where lying can be justified, it must be remembered that dishonesty is still a form of manipulation and deception. It can be dangerous, both for the person being lied to and for the liar themselves. Ultimately, it is important to ask oneself whether the potential harm done by lying outweighs any potential benefits. In most cases, the answer is likely to be no.",
                "ply that whatever the cost, as long as the final outcome is beneficial, any actions taken to bring about that outcome are acceptable, even if they include lying. This kind of thinking is flawed because honesty and integrity are important values. They are essential not only for individuals but for organizations and even nations. When lies are used to achieve a certain end, eventually the truth is always discovered, and this leads to a loss of trust and credibility. Hence, in the long term, lying can never be justified, whatever the ends may be.\nOn the other hand, motives can play a role in whether a lie is justifiable or not. If lying is done with malicious intent, such as to cause harm to others or to gain an unfair advantage, then it can never be justified. However, if lying is done out of compassion, to protect someone from harm or to prevent a worse outcome, then it can be justifiable. For example, if a child is being abused and she lies to protect herself or her family, then that lie can be considered justifiable.\nUltimately, the justification of lying boils down to a case-by-case analysis. While lying is not commendable, there may be exceptional cases that warrant it. However, one must always pause and think before resorting to any form of deceit, weighing the potential risks and rewards, and consider the possible long-term consequences of such actions.",
                "ply that if the outcome of telling a lie achieves a desirable result, then the lie is justified. However, this reasoning is not foolproof. If lying becomes a habit to achieve good results, the act of lying becomes normalised and can lead to people using it as a means to achieve whatever they desire. This is where the motive for lying comes in. Lying should only be a last resort when it comes to achieving a goal. The lie should be made for the greater good, not just to serve the liar's own self-interests. Additionally, the lie must not harm others or cause conflict.\nIn conclusion, the question of whether telling lies can ever be justified is tricky. The morality of the act should be considered alongside the situation and the potential consequences of the lie. While lying can be a means to achieve a desirable outcome, it can also lead to a web of lies and destroyed relationships. Therefore, lying should only be used as a last resort and with a clear motive for the greater good.",
                "ply that if the end is good enough, then any means to achieve it is acceptable. But is this really so? Can the ultimate end really justify any means, especially when those means are morally wrong, dishonest or unethical? Surely, the means used to reach the ends must also be judged and evaluated - whether they are in themselves acceptable, and at what cost they are achieved.\nSimilarly, motive can also be used to help in justifying lies. If the motive of the lie is for the greater good, then perhaps it can be justified. For example, if a person tells a lie to save a life or prevent harm, then it may be morally acceptable to do so. However, lying for personal gain or to cause harm to others can never be justified, and will always be wrong.\nIn conclusion, while telling lies cannot be completely justified in all situations, there are indeed circumstances where it may be acceptable to do so. Each situation must be carefully evaluated for its unique circumstances before making a decision on whether to lie or not. Honesty should always be the default position, but sometimes, if we are honest with ourselves, we may find that being dishonest may be the only way forward to accomplish a greater good.",
                "ply that anything, even lying, can be justified as long as the outcome is desirable. However, this can be problematic as the end result should not override the importance of honesty and integrity. Similarly, the motive behind lying can also be taken into consideration. For instance, if the motive is to protect someone from harm or danger, it may be more justifiable than if the motive is to gain personal advantage or to manipulate others for selfish reasons.\nIn conclusion, while telling lies can never be completely justified from a moral standpoint, there are situations where lying may have some justifications. However, it should be approached cautiously and with careful consideration of the potential consequences and motivations behind the action. Ultimately, honesty remains a virtue to be upheld and valued in all relationships and interactions.",
                "ply that no matter what the action, as long as the desired outcome is achieved, it is acceptable. However, we cannot ignore the fact that how we achieve our goals and objectives is just as important as the achievement itself. If we use dishonest means to reach our desired ends, then the victory is bittersweet and not truly deserved. The principle of integrity should not be compromised.\nAnother way to evaluate whether a lie is justifiable is to examine the motive behind it. Is it for selfish reasons, such as to gain personal advantage or to avoid punishment, or is it for altruistic reasons, such as to protect someone from harm or to prevent a conflict? If the latter is the case, then one could argue that the lie is justifiable, but if it is for the former, then it is not.\nIn conclusion, while it may be difficult to formulate a blanket \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d answer to the question of whether lying can ever be justified, it is important to constantly evaluate the situation and the potential consequences before deciding on the best course of action. The principle of honesty and integrity should always be upheld, but at the same time, compassionate and pragmatic decisions may need to be made in certain circumstances.",
                "ply that no matter how immoral a method is, as long as the result is a desirable one, it is justifiable. However, if the method involves lying, then it cannot be justified as lying entails a violation of trust and honesty. For example, a politician who lies to win an election to implement societal changes may seem justified, but in reality, they will lose the trust of the people they are trying to help, and their actions will backfire; hence, their lies cannot be justified.\nMotive is another factor for justifying lies. If the lie is for a good cause, such as lying to protect a vulnerable person, or lying to prevent harm, such lies may be justifiable. In these situations, lying becomes an act of compassion, and the lie can be seen as morally right. However, even in these cases, the consequences of the lie need to be weighed against the benefits of telling the truth. If the consequences of the lie are too severe, then the lie may not be justified.\nIn conclusion, whether telling lies can be justified or not depends on the situation, motive and consequences of the lie. While white lies can be seen as benign and may not have significant consequences, other lies can have long-term damages to relationships and trust. Ultimately, we need to be conscious of the impact our words and actions have on others and ourselves, and strive to be honest and truthful in our dealings with others."

Similarly, every person who has lived a long life can act as a counsellor to the younger generation. Thus, longevity is a blessing in light of this.\nAlso, it is a person with a long life who in his last years, gets to reflect upon his life, whether it be the good old days\u2019 or the \u2018bad old days. I always feel it must be quite enjoyable for an old person to reflect on, to reminisce on the past, evoking fond memories and how they got through the difficult times. A person with a shorter life would not have the opportunity to do that. He would probably die still in his working days, too busy to reflect on life. In addition, a longer life would simply mean more time to be with the family, friends. Thus longevity is a blessing.\nHowever, as I mentioned before, it can be an irony to wish our elders a long life, that is, longevity can be a curse too. Firstly, the older one gets, the more prone one becomes to sickness, ailments, like heart problems, rheumatism, backache and so on. The old are subjected to poor eyesight, difficulty in hearing, weak bones and slower reaction. They are thus the ones who suffer falls, often get involved in traffic accidents and so on. Thus in a way, we are actually cursing our elders by wishing them long life. Longevity can be a curse too.\nTo the country, more old people would mean a financial burden on the society and the tax-payers. In society today, very sad to say, old people are being seen as a bur den and even a nuisance. That is why old-folks homes are thriving in Singapore. Longevity can thus become a curse to the country. To reiterate, we are addressing a very controversial issue in the world today. Are old people a burden? Is longevity a blessing or curse? Well, it all depends on the individual. One who wants life to gain knowledge, to do meaningful things would consider longevity. a blessing. However, one who wastes his or her life doing meaningless things or one who is stuck with some incurable illness would probably find longevity a curse.\nNonetheless, I would not want to live too long a life.",

While advancements in healthcare have led to longer lifespans, they have not necessarily been able to guarantee an equally high quality of life for everyone. \n\nAnother challenge of longevity is the societal expectations that come with it. As we grow older, there is often an assumption that we will retire from work and transition into a more sedentary lifestyle. While this may be desirable for some, not everyone is ready or willing to give up working or pursuing their passions. Unfortunately, ageism can make it difficult for older adults to secure employment or be taken seriously in their chosen fields. This can be frustrating and can threaten one's sense of self-worth and identity.\n\nIt is also worth considering the impact that longevity can have on society as a whole. As our global population continues to age, there will be increased demand for healthcare and social services. Governments and policy-makers will need to find ways to fund and provide these services, which may require difficult trade-offs. Furthermore, an ageing population could put strain on the economy, as older adults may have less disposable income and be less likely to contribute to the workforce. These are complex and multifaceted issues that must be addressed in order to ensure that longevity truly is a blessing for everyone.\n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there are both benefits and challenges associated with living a long life. While there are certainly many reasons to celebrate the concept of longevity, it is important to be aware of the complexities that come with it.

It is therefore important to strike a balance when wishing for longevity, wishing for good health, financial stability and support for our beloved elders.\n\nIn conclusion, longevity is a blessing if we view it as an opportunity to live a meaningful life, to acquire knowledge and wisdom, and to contribute back to society.

In a society that values youth and beauty, a very old person may feel isolated, lonely and trapped in a society that has no place for the aging population. The old age comes with its own set of challenges such as loneliness, ill health, and unmet social needs. An aging population in Singapore is a societal issue that requires attention and care. Therefore, while longevity may be a blessing, it should be accompanied by good health, independence, and social integration.\nIn conclusion, longevity is a blessing if we view it positively, as an opportunity to continue learning, doing good and leaving a positive legacy in society. Wishing longevity to someone does carry a certain degree of irony, as an aging population faces its own set of challenges.

Instead, we should wish for quality life for them, filled with happiness and contentment. \nIn conclusion, while the act of wishing longevity may seem like a simple act, it carries with it deeper consequences. We should, therefore, be mindful and reflect on whether we are truly blessing someone or possibly cursing them with such a wish.

In this sense, longevity is indeed a blessing.\nHowever, there is also an irony to wishing someone longevity. People might wish for longevity, but when they accumulate many years and they become frail and ill, life becomes a curse rather than a blessing. They become dependent on others to take care of them and have no control over their lives. This realization makes us question whether it is truly a blessing to live longer when we lose control of our own autonomy and quality of life.\nIn conclusion, the idea that \"Longevity is a blessing\" can be interpreted in many ways. From a positive perspective, it is a chance to acquire more knowledge, do more meaningful things, and share wisdom with younger generations. On the other hand, being alive without any quality of life can turn it into a curse, which calls for us to re-think what we mean by longevity.",

They have lived longer and seen more, hence their opinions can be highly valuable. Therefore, longevity is a blessing, as it gives one the chance to impart wisdom and leave a lasting impact on society.\nOn the other hand, the irony is that people these days may not necessarily want to live too long. With the advancement of medical technology, many elderly people might get their lives prolonged, but they may not be able to enjoy the quality of life they desire. They may be bound to a wheelchair, bedridden or suffer from terminal illnesses. In such cases, living longer may not be a blessing but rather a curse, as they may not be able to live with dignity or lead a fulfilling life. Moreover, living a long life may also entail losing loved ones along the way, seeing friends and acquaintances pass away, which can be a painful experience. Thus, at times, longevity may not seem like such a blessing.\nIn conclusion, longevity can be a blessing in the sense that it provides more opportunities to learn, gives more time to do meaningful things and allows one to share knowledge, wisdom, and experience with others. However, living long may come with certain trade-offs and may not be desirable in certain cases, where it could also mean a life of suffering. It is thus important to cherish every moment of life, regardless of how long or short it may be."

            "human_gen_truncate": " society in future, where commitment is a strange word for many who do not see it in their own parents.\nMarriage should also be a life-long commitment, not only because of what God wants, of keeping to our promises, of being a role model for the future generation, for the sake of containing the already decaying moral values, but also because if marriage is not a life-long commitment, you may as well term it \u201ccohabitation. Many who cohabited excuse it as a try-out test for their future marriage, if there is to be one. Plainly to be seen, what cohabitation really provides is an access to exit, to bail out quickly when problems arise. They are not responsible enough for life-long commitment, that is marriage.\nSome may argue that marriage should not always mean \u201clife-long commitment.\u201d They cite examples like wife beaters, alcoholics or the career woman who mistreat their partners. I recognise that it is easier said than done, but that is where forgiveness, dedication and love come in. Love does not necessarily mean letting the other partner go on erring; instead, it means helping him to come to his senses. All this entails human endeavour that humans are capable of if they try their best and both partners must help each other.\nTherefore, I conclude that marriage should be a life long commitment because basically marriage calls for responsibility. It is a bond not to be taken lightly. It is not a fashion fad, an escape route, or a try-out. They say diamonds are forever, so are marriages.",

For example, individuals who are subjected to abuse, whether it is physical, emotional, or psychological, may stay in toxic relationships because of the commitment to marriage. In such cases, the lifelong commitment to marriage can pose a danger to the well-being of individuals.\n\nOn the other hand, proponents of lifelong commitment to marriage argue that it is necessary for the continuity of family structures. A lifelong commitment to marriage strengthens the bond between two individuals, and it also provides a stable environment for children. Children brought up in stable households are often healthier, happier, and more successful in life. A lifelong commitment to marriage also sets an excellent example for children, who grow up in a household where the value of commitment and dedication is held in high regard.\n\nAnother argument for lifelong commitment to marriage is that it strengthens the moral fabric of society. Marriage promotes a sense of responsibility and accountability, encouraging individuals to work through problems together rather than giving up at the first sign of trouble. Additionally, lifelong commitment to marriage has been shown to promote love, trust, and intimacy. All these values are essential for the establishment and maintenance of a successful long-term relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the debate over whether marriage should be a lifelong commitment has pros and cons. While the call for shorter-term commitments may seem attractive, the benefits of lifelong commitment to marriage, such as promoting the stability of family structures and setting an example for children, cannot be overlooked. On the other hand, lifelong commitment to marriage may lead to unhappy marriages and can be harmful to individuals who are subjected to abuse.

The lifelong commitment to marriage signifies the depth of the love between two individuals and their willingness to work through challenges together. Additionally, lifelong commitment is what sets marriage apart from other forms of relationships, giving it a unique level of significance and meaning.\n\nFurthermore, studies have shown that couples who make a lifelong commitment to each other are generally happier than those in shorter-term relationships. This is because they feel more secure and committed to each other, and they are willing to work through any issues that may arise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of a lifelong commitment to marriage may seem daunting, it is essential to remember the significance and value behind it.

It provides couples with a long-term, strong foundation to work through problems, and enhances the notion of building a family together. \n\nIn conclusion, whether marriage should be a lifelong commitment or not is a grey area with differing opinions.

Many believe that by having shorter-term commitments, individuals have the flexibility to exit a relationship that no longer serves them, allowing them to seek happiness in other forms.\n\nDespite the arguments supporting shorter-term commitments in marriage, there are still valid reasons why people believe marriage should be a life-long commitment. Firstly, marriage is not just a legal union, but it is also a social and religious institution. In various cultures and religions, marriage is considered a sacrament that brings two people together under the watchful eyes of God. For these individuals, the lifelong bond is a way of committing to each other, not just as partners but also as moral and spiritual beings.\n\nAdditionally, in a marriage that has stood the test of time, the partners involved often develop a deeper trust and understanding of each other. They may have gone through ups and downs that have taught them valuable lessons and brought them closer together. By committing to each other for the rest of their lives, couples are essentially saying that they will stand by each other, no matter what life throws at them.\n\nIn conclusion, while the idea of shorter-term commitments in marriage may appeal to some individuals, it is important to appreciate the values and principles that underpin lifelong commitment to the institution. Marriage is a complex and multi-faceted institution, and it is crucial to take into account the beliefs, practices, and norms that are associated with it before seeking to redefine it.

This can create a strong emotional bond between the two partners, which can provide them with the necessary support during challenging situations.\n\nMoreover, lifelong commitment to marriage can also be beneficial for children. Children who grow up in stable households, with parents who are committed to each other, are more likely to experience positive outcomes, such as better academic performance, better mental health, and fewer behavioral problems.\n\nIn conclusion, the question of whether marriage should be a lifelong commitment is a complex one, with both pros and cons on each side. While some argue that shorter-term commitments offer more flexibility, others argue that lifelong commitments provide much-needed stability to individuals.

Firstly, marriage is not just a bond between two individuals; it is a union of two families. For this reason, many cultures place a great deal of importance on lifelong commitment to marriage. Moreover, marriage is a legal contract, and it comes with several legal benefits, such as joint tax returns, inheritance rights, and access to health benefits. These legal benefits can only be fully enjoyed if the marriage is considered a lifelong commitment.\n\nAnother essential argument for lifelong commitment to marriage is the sense of stability and security that it offers to the family unit. When individuals vow to love and support each other for the rest of their lives, they create a safe and stable environment for their children to grow up in. This psychological safety net helps children become more adjusted and grounded individuals and helps them navigate the complexities of life better.\n\nIn conclusion, while there may be arguments for shorter-term commitments in marriage, the lifelong commitment to the institution still holds significant importance. Marriage is not just a union between two individuals, but between two families and carries a legal contract and several legal benefits, which can only be realized if the marriage is viewed as a lifelong commitment. Moreover, the sense of stability, security, and psychological safety that a lifelong commitment offers is essential for the healthy growth and development of children."

Prominent females, like Margaret Thatcher, have shown that women, too, can have a say in matters of the world.\nIn the past, women and girls were denied education by the men since they found it to be redundant and use less to one who is supposed to stay at home and bring up children, but the situation is different now, when young girls are given the same opportunities for education as young boys. Females are generally thought to be living better lives in today\u2019s modern world but the question still remains: Can the situation be even better or is this the best society can do?\nI feel that there are still many situations of sexual discrimination which continue to exist despite the fact that life for a female is generally better. This is especially more apparently so in our conservative Asian society where traditionally, men are still believed to be the superior sex. Take Singapore, for example; how many female politicians are there? It is a figure which can be counted on one hand! Although certain ideas (such as the one that women should stay at home) are being gradually worn down, it is still difficult for society to accept certain ideas or dreams a woman might have. For example, a woman might want to join the army but in such a traditionally male-dominated job in certain conservative societies, it is difficult for a lone woman to change this narrow perception. Many women, besides politicians, are also not given the due respect they deserve for achieving so much with their lives. (Changes have been witnessed: Mdm Halimah Yacob as SG\u2019s President, Kalama Harris as USA Vice President, etc) The success of businesswomen who can juggle both a career and family is taken for granted.\nI am aware of the sad fact that men and women can never be on equal terms because of the numerous differences between them \u2013 biological, emotional or physical but many improvements to the way women are treated by men and society are still desired. Therefore, to the statement, \u201cWomen have never had it so good\u201d, I can only say that I can agree with it. In fact, \u201cWomen have never had it bad, at least not in Singapore!\u201d",

Despite the significant strides that have been made, women still face structural barriers and hidden biases that make it difficult for them to progress in their careers.\n\nMoreover, the representation of women in the media remains problematic. Women are often depicted as sexual objects and are subjected to unrealistic expectations and ideals in terms of their appearance and behavior. These objectifications contribute to gender stereotypes and reinforce the notion that women's worth is linked to their physical appearance.\n\nIn recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has also highlighted the gender inequalities that persist in many societies. The burdens of childcare and domestic work have fallen disproportionately on women during the pandemic, further exacerbating existing inequalities.\n\nIn conclusion, while there have undoubtedly been significant gains for women in terms of political representation, education, and career opportunities, it would be premature to suggest that women have never had it so good.

Is it not a shame to be able to take life in a few seconds, so sim ply, and easily? For example, in Singapore, abortions can be carried out with the mere payment of $5.00. Is life worth only that little? It is truly a degradation of the hu man species by making life seem so cheap and useless. Moreover, with the creation of drugs such as the RU486, abortion can be carried out without any pain at all and the mother is said to be able to \u2018dance a jig\u2019 two hours later.\nBut then, why raise such an alarmist view on abortion when suicide, murder and death sentences have existed for such a long long time? There is no set answer for it is up to an individual to decide.\nPro-natalists also argue that abortion is used as a means of population control. Maybe the reaction should be \u2018Goodness gracious me!\u2019 Don\u2019t we have enough methods of birth control that save so much trouble by avoiding fertilisation all together? Why conceive at all if one plans to terminate the pregnancy? Must that be the method of birth control she chooses? Indeed, it is horrible to think of it that way but it is true, for certain countries do use abortion for population control reasons. This further pro motes sexual promiscuity as, since abortion can be so easily \u2018obtained\u2019, why restrain yourself at all?! For example in Singapore, before the 1970\u2019s, the number of abortions per year used to be less than 50 people but currently, more than 20,000 abortions a year are carried out, 10% being teenagers. The Abortion Act of 1974 allows abortion with the written consent of the mother, and for girls above 18, parental consent is not needed. Pro-abortionists ask why a child should be brought into the world when he is after all going to suffer because of his parents? But then again, who are we to judge the future? Maybe, we should just let nature take her course.\nHence, it is hard to give one rigid stand on the question of abortion for it would seem to be like passing a judgement in the dark, without evidence. The issue should be studied on a case to case basis. Abolishing abortion completely would only lead to more \u2018underground abortion clinics\u2019 and allowing it completely would only cause further controversy and conflict. The issue continues.",

Certainly we can be responsible for own health by adopting a healthier, better lifestyle.\nWe can take into account our mental health, besides physical health. It is up to us to purposely seek relief from stress. We can plan our own leisure and take up hobbies to pass time. Relaxation is important to keep our body and mind hale and hearty. After a long day\u2019s work, it is imperative for us to enjoy ourselves. To deny ourselves rest and persist to work overtime can be detrimental to our bodies.

            "human_gen_truncate": " Kuwait has still not regained its economic strength of the 1980\u2019s. At the risk of incurring the wrath of peace groups, I still think that the government should also aim to build strong armed forces to be used as a deterrent against would-be aggressors should diplomacy fail.\nGovernment should also aim to improve the physical and mental health of the people. Environmental standards must be set to prevent over-zealous entrepreneurs from poisoning the earth\u2019s atmosphere and natural re sources. A country of sick men will be of no use to any body. For humanitarian as well as practical reasons, the government should seek to provide health care for the people. American President John F Kennedy\u2019s Medicare and Lyndon B Johnson\u2019s Social Security Amendment Act in the 1960s are good examples of the state provision of health care. The consequences of falling health standards are most evident in India now where the plague is having a field day killing people. Governments must act now and make health care their top priority or it may be too late.\nLast but not least, one of the main aims of government should be to educate its people and try to establish a nation of scholars. The people are the nation\u2019s most valuable resource. They are the ones who contribute to the successes of the nation economically, socially and politically. In fact, a nation is made up of its citizens. It has been proven that people who are more highly-educated produce a larger output of goods and services and are a source of social benefit to the community. There fore, maintaining and raising educational standards should be a major objective of the government. A good example is Singapore where more than 90% of the population is literate. Its strong economic performance and stable society bear testimony to the benefits reaped from a nation of highly educated people.\nIn conclusion, the aims of a government should be to promote economic prosperity, maintain security and in crease the physical and mental well-being of its people.

This is important for economic and political stability. Governments use diplomacy, international aid, and trade agreements to promote international relations and cooperation. For instance, countries may form alliances to promote trade and investment or provide humanitarian assistance to countries in need. In Singapore, the government has established strong relations with other countries to promote trade and investment. The country is a member of various trade agreements such as ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA), which have helped to promote economic growth and development.\n\nLastly, the government has a responsibility to promote environmental protection and sustainability. Environmental sustainability aims to ensure that the current generation's needs are met without compromising future generations' ability to meet their needs. Governments use policies such as environmental regulation, pollution control, and conservation to promote environmental protection and sustainability. In Singapore, the government has implemented a range of measures to promote sustainability, such as investing in renewable energy, promoting recycling, and encouraging green technology innovation.\n\nIn conclusion, governments have various aims and objectives that they strive to achieve through their policies and actions.

Large amounts of revenue may be derived from the tourists and fans who come into the country to view the event and also through promotions, advertisements, the sale of souvenirs and tickets. Restaurants and hotels also benefit from the influx of foreigners.\nBy changing our perspective from the economic scene to focus on the social scene, we find that in built-up areas of high population density, it is an important town planning factor to provide sporting arenas and facilities to entertain the local population, especially in housing estates. Furthermore, the development of sporting activities among local young people is important to steer them towards good physical development as well as building qualities such as discipline endurance, patience and de termination, which are prime requisites for success in sports.

For instance, in Bosnia-Herzogovena, the Serbs are slaughtering Bosnians by the thousands under their scheme of ethnic cleansing. More recently, conflict has erupted in Rwanda between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes after the assassination of their President. As a result, many Tutsis have been massacred by the Hutu security forces. What is more disheartening is that the United Nations are not taking any significant measures to end such genocide. Thus there is a strong possibility that more of such conflicts will arise in the future.\nMeanwhile, in the social sphere, mankind should also be pessimistic about the future. To date rising crime rates are experienced in many Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Moreover, the crimes are becoming more brutal and the criminals younger and younger. Children are no longer the symbol of innocence. For instance, in London, two ten-year-old children were arrested for bludgeoning a toddler, James Bulger to death. Meanwhile, in major cities in the United States people are being gunned down daily. With such ever-increasing crime rates, how can mankind be optimistic about the future if our personal safety is being threatened increasingly?\nIn the economic sphere, mankind also has little rea son to be optimistic about the future. With the fall of the communist nations, one might have expected the world economy to boom due to the emergence of new markets. However, this is not the case. In fact, the fall of communism has worsened the global economic situation by creating massive unemployment and hyperinflation.\nFor instance, with German Reunification in 1989, Western Germany\u2019s unemployment rate almost trebled. This was because most of the citizens of the ex-communist East Germany lacked sufficient training for most of the jobs available. With the reunification the East Germany army was dissolved and this created massive unemployment. In the People\u2019s Republic of China, hyperinflation is rampant as not enough consumer goods. are produced to meet local market demand. Such conditions threaten to persist into the future.\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, we should certainly be pessimistic about the future.

Thus, it is largely up to the fam ily to make culture and religion a part of young people\u2019s lives.\nAnother important part of the family\u2019s role in nurturing youth is in the sort of influence the parents. and siblings present. I recall an incident when my uncle tried to convince my cousin to work harder in her studies. My indignant cousin retorted matter-of-factly that since her brother did not work hard then she had no obligation to do otherwise! Influence can be divided into two broad categories: good and bad. The bad influence can include anything from a lack of proper manners and using vulgar obscenities to committing crimes. Young children\u2019s impressionable minds are easy victims of such negative influences, and teenagers are encouraged by their elders\u2019 actions and use them to justify their own errors. Good influences, however, lend moral strength and help in moulding young people\u2019s characters.\nLastly, the family\u2019s role is important in nurturing young people through the social environment it presents. It is crucial that the environment the family presents is one of security, warmth and love. Such an environment is conducive to the building of good character, for the young person is not bothered by many other problems she would face in a turbulent environment. Insecurity, in the face of financial difficulties, divorces between bickering parents, and other problems the family faces, threaten the cohesion of the family as a unit and give young people more problems. Young children are confused and helpless in the face of so-called \u201cadult problems\u201d and these problems, especially divorce and poverty, leave scars on the child\u2019s memories and may hinder the child\u2019s ability to form strong and fruitful relation ships in the future. Teenagers already face the stress of their academic endeavour and the confusion of emotional problems, and need a more secure environment for a sense of peace. More often than not, the desire to belong in a larger group and to be popular is observed in a teenager. If she does not experience this sense of belonging even in the family, she is more apt to break down in the face of peer pressure. In more serious cases, teenagers join gangs and other small groups, and then indulge in activities not constructive in improving their lots in life.

In traditional festivals such as Chinese New Year, it is traditional for people to buy furniture and new clothes. Consumer spending increases and thus stimulates the economy. Such festivals also help to keep the family together. In modern society, families tend to be small. Festivals give them a reason to come together to celebrate. For example, Hari Raya Puasa which the Malays celebrate, brings the whole community together not only to celebrate but to do good deeds by donating foodstuffs and money for the less fortunate. Such festivals also enable people to get to know other races and cultivate tolerance and understanding between races.\n\u201cYeo\u2019s, tradition in a can.\u201d This slogan has been used in advertising the glass jelly drink Yeo Hiap Seng has been promoting.

Similarly, during the Ming dynasty era in China, scientific and technological advancements were ignored because they were thought to be destructive to ancient traditions and beliefs. Through this period of self-imposed ignorance and isolation, China lost its pioneering age.\n\nNevertheless, one must understand that tradition is not inherently stagnant. Rather, the nature of tradition is continually changing and evolving. This evolution is evidence that tradition can indeed help progress. It serves as an essential source of identity for many individuals and societies, providing a sense of stability and continuity. Tradition's dynamism allows it to adapt to different situations, providing guidance and support when it is needed, promoting cultural diversity, and helping societies navigate social changes. For example, in Singapore, the integration of Malay culture into the Chinese-dominated society has helped promote racial harmony. If not for these traditions, Singapore would not be the multi-ethnic and multicultural country it is today.\n\nFurthermore, tradition can provide a starting point for progress. Indeed, some of the world's most significant scientific discoveries were made by building on established knowledge from the past. Medical professionals' reliance on traditional remedies in Western medicine is one such example of how progress has been made by building on established knowledge. Modern-day scientists and medical practitioners use traditional knowledge as the foundation of their work. The knowledge gained from traditional remedies often shapes modern treatments. \n\nIn conclusion, there is no straightforward answer to the question of whether tradition hinders progress. While adherence to tradition can impede modernization and evolution in various aspects of life, a nuanced approach to tradition can promote societal growth in other areas.

This resistance to change hindered progress, leading to Japan's lagging behind western countries in terms of modernization.\n\nHowever, we should not entirely discredit tradition as a source of progress. Many progressive movements have been built upon the foundation of traditional values. For example, the civil rights movement in the United States drew on the tradition of equality and justice for all. Tradition can, therefore, provide a framework for progress, enabling societal development that respects the fundamental values of a community. \n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that tradition can sometimes hinder progress, we must be careful not to dismiss it entirely. While we should not blindly follow tradition without questioning its relevance, we should also not dismiss it as an obstacle to progress. Instead, we should take a nuanced approach that respects both progressive change and the values of our diverse cultural heritage.

For example, Singapore's National Day Parade is a potent display of tradition that unites Singaporeans across different backgrounds while simultaneously contributing to progress. The incorporation of modern technology in the parade allows for a showcase of Singapore's achievements in fields such as science, art, and technology. \n\nIn conclusion, the phrase \"tradition hinders progress\" is a complex statement that ignores the multifaceted nature of tradition and progress. While it is true that tradition can sometimes impede progress, it is important to recognize that tradition can also inspire progressive change.

For instance, traditions instill a set of moral values and can help preserve knowledge that might inform progress. When the sense of continuity is established through traditions, it can create a conducive environment for development. Tradition can serve as a bridge to the future, where new ideas can be built on the foundation of established customs.\n\nIn conclusion, while tradition may create some hindrances to progress, it can also foster an environment that encourages it. The relationship between tradition and progress might not be absolute, and it is essential to strike a balance between these two. It is important for individuals and societies to understand when tradition serves to aid progress and when it acts as an obstacle. Therefore, instead of labelling traditions as hindrances to progress, we should try to identify practices that require modification to make way for sustainable progress."

But only in extreme cases should capital punishment be used and if it is, then it should be done only after a thorough analysis of the criminal and his crime. Also criminals should be executed in the most humane way possible to minimise suffering, as well as dis tress to family members.\nOne of the biggest problems facing the justice system at present is the deteriorating conditions of prisons. Prisoners are forced to live in filthy, often crowded cells and the food provided is inadequate. Thus there is a need for better planned prisons with adequate living space for each prisoner. Sanitation and cleaning should be improved. The meals provided should be nutritious since usually prisoners must do some form of work. They should also be suitably paid for this so that when they are released they will have some form of financial support. The system of solitary confinement should be abolished as it can cause a lot of psychological harm to a prisoner.\nThe authorities must try to rehabilitate criminals as far as possible through counselling and therapy. Psychiatric help should be provided when necessary. Visits from family and friends should be allowed more frequently and mail should not be censored. Each prisoner should be treated individually and his privacy should be respected. This will help to reduce the otherwise dehumanising effect of prisons.\nThe persecution of criminals continues even after their subject to constant hostility and ill-treatment release but this time by society. They find it difficult to find work as people are reluctant to employ ex-convicts. Society should be more tolerant towards them and accept them into the fold.

Rehabilitation can also provide a sense of hope and opportunity for those who may have previously felt trapped in a cycle of crime.\n\nIt is important to note that rehabilitation does not replace punishment. Criminals should still be held accountable for their actions and punished accordingly. However, by combining punishment and rehabilitation, we can address both sides of the issue. This also aligns with the principle of restorative justice, which focuses on repairing the harm caused by crime rather than simply punishing the offender.\n\nOf course, the implementation of punishment and rehabilitation is easier said than done. Our criminal justice system is often criticized for being overly punitive and not focused enough on rehabilitation. There are also issues around funding and resources - providing comprehensive rehabilitation programs requires significant resources and financial investment.\n\nDespite these challenges, it is important that we strive for a balance between punishment and rehabilitation. This approach takes into account both the need to hold criminals accountable for their actions and the desire to address the root causes of criminal behavior. It also emphasizes the potential for change and growth in individuals, rather than simply writing them off as irredeemable.\n\nIn conclusion, the treatment of criminals is a complex and multifaceted issue. Punishment has its place in the criminal justice system, but it should not be the only focus. Rehabilitation is equally important in addressing the underlying issues that contribute to criminal behavior and preventing re-offense. A combination of punishment and rehabilitation is necessary in order to hold criminals accountable for their actions while also providing them with the tools they need to succeed in society.

Skills training should also be made available to them to enable them to take up useful vocations in society, after they have been released.\nIn conclusion, the treatment of criminals should take into account the circumstances surrounding the offences committed. Leniency may be shown to first-time offenders, but severe punishments must be given to those who continue to commit crimes, even after being counseled and rehabilitated. However, the criminal should be treated humanely, and efforts should be undertaken to help criminal offenders turn over a new leaf and assimilate back into society.

Therefore, investing in social welfare and education programs may also prove instrumental in reducing crime rates. Providing children from disadvantaged backgrounds with access to quality education and other resources could effectively break the cycle of poverty that often results in criminality.\nIn conclusion, how a criminal should be treated ultimately depends on the individual circumstances of the case.

The punishment should match the crime, but there should also be an effort to understand the underlying reasons behind the crime and trying to address them.

Efforts should be made to provide opportunities for reformed criminals so that they have a chance to get a job and earn a living. In addition, people should try to understand the circumstances that led to the criminal behaviour and offer support to those who seek it.\nIn conclusion, the manner in which criminals are treated must be reviewed and evaluated based on different factors such as severity of the crime, the individual's history and circumstances.

The focus should be on rehabilitating offenders and correcting their behaviour instead of solely punishing them. This will not only help offenders but also benefit society as a whole.

Children can also undertake work in other places and supplement the family income. This practice is com mon in countries with agricultural societies like India. In Pakistan, young children of poor families are sold to car pet makers. Rich families have children to ensure that the family business stays within the family, usually with the eldest child taking over from the father.\nPeople also have children to bring happiness to their lives.

These young girls will have to look after their husbands and accompany them for the rest of their lives and later these girls are often abandoned by their husbands. In India, girls are also forced to marry young because many families feel that it is too expensive to look after girls. This reveals the selfishness of man. These people force their children to marry some one they do not love or know and this is done without their consent. This problem of early marriage is wide spread in Third World countries, however in most developed countries, children often marry at a mature age and with a freedom to choose their own life partners. For all this I believe the ugly side of man still evident here.\nNowadays children are often neglected by parents and this occurs even in a modern society. Children experience mental and emotional pain in such situations. Once children are neglected by parents, they lack their parental love, warmth, care and guidance. They do not have anyone to nurture them. The children\u2019s minds are not stable and may be easily influenced into bad ways. One main reason why parents neglect their children is that they are too occupied with their office work or too busy pursuing their careers or are involved in less savoury occupations. In a few cases, the parents totally neglect their children\u2019s feelings and limits. They have too high expectations for their children and want them to excel academically. This leads to an absurd amount of pressure and the occasional suicide. This reveals the selfish and ironically uncaring side of parents who are only interested in their work and do not bother about their children but expect them to do well in their studies. For all that, most parents today try to keep their weekends free to accompany their children and provide them with all their love and support. Ugliness is still a feature of man\u2019s nature when these things are missing.\nThere are other unthinkable cases of child abuse. In Thailand and Vietnam, there are children who are kidnapped by some men and parts of their bodies are amputated so that they look like cripples. These children are then forced to be beggars. The money in turn will be collected by those ruthless men. Some babies are killed and their organs are removed and sold to the hospitals for transplant operations. The people who sell the organs are paid a high price. This reveals the cruel and greedy side of man.

As a general rule, children from happy families with full and loving childhoods grow up to be come gregarious and cheerful people.\nIt is ironic that society, which the family is supposed to serve, is destroying family values. Teenagers respect. their parents less nowadays; they would rather \u201chang out\u201d with their friends and often neglect their families in the process. The great increase in leisure and entertainment facilities has contributed to this. Mounting work pressure and the fear of being deemed \u201cnot economically vi able\u201d by their firms have turned many working parents into workaholics leaving their children to the care of relatives or child care centres.

Families act as the primary source of emotional support and socialization, especially during formative years. Parents play a central role in providing a strong foundation to their children, instilling moral values, and nurturing their talents. Through families, individuals learn the necessary skills to integrate and participate in their communities actively.\n\nMoreover, family dynamics have changed across generations, and the importance of the traditional family unit might be evolving, not disappearing.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ence defeating the aim of censorship. The youths of today are particularly susceptible to such symptoms, mainly because of the advent of liberalism and materialism. To cope with such subversive forces, society might implement even firmer, stricter measures, only to find the subversive force has increased as a result.\nSelf-regulation controls the curiosity and rebellioness of an individual in a way no external authority could. Be cause self-regulation is home of discipline and a firm, entrenched understanding of the undesirable nature of restricted information, curiosity and rebellionness are controlled by these characteristics. In this context, it is the only means of censorship, since other means only intensify the undesirable side effected.\nThe desirable nature of self-regulation may also be seen by comparing the short and long-term effects of this and other means of censorship. As noted before, other means of censorship require dominant authorities to enforce the regulation of materials. In the short-term, these means are far more effective than self-regulation, since self-regulation requires an education of some sort \u2013 be it from the family or the school or some government campaign-to inculcate the proper values of restraint and discipline that render the device effective. In the long term however, these other means of censorship may fail in protecting the psychological and mental health of a people since many things might occur to defeat these authorities. Anew government may be formed, relaxing the regulation in censorship. Wars and natural disasters may read the authorities temporarily paralyzed, but this is sufficient for an explosion of information to hence people\u2019s minds. As a result, the effort and money put into the censorship may be wasted eventually. Now, however where externally-administered agents of censorship falter, self-regulation may ultimately triumph.\nFuelled by personal desire and borne of individual discipline and rectitude, external elements face a psychological wall resistant to penetration. Where new tyrannies may hope to subvert the society, such as dictatorships, the mind is buttressed against the corruption of such subversive ideas, In the long-run, therefore, self-regulation may well be the only means of censorship.\nHowever, the persistency of self-regulation may well stultify the mental growth of an individual. Once one\u2019s mind is narrowed by self-regulation based on a strict doctrine, one loses the open-mindedness needed for creativity, innovation and a general broadening of one\u2019s horizons. This self-regulation, if enforced by the strict bar raging of one\u2019s mind by education, becomes a result of brainwashing. Self-regulation, therefore, to be effective as well as conducive to the individual\u2019s mental growth and development, must also include a general flexibility and open mindedness.\nIn terms of goals to be achieved, self-regulation may well be the only means of censorship. Censorship hopes to train the individual to be a responsible member of society without excessive corrupt influences, and through the exclusion of such influences, strives to create a discerning and responsible individual, well trained in the ideals of moral rectitude and discipline, necessary for social cohesion. Self-regulation, though, is already a product of these ideals-without these it cannot succeed. There fore self-regulation, in being the eventual goal of all forms of censorship, may be the only means of censorship.\nIn conclusion, one may see that self-regulation, while being an intangible asset borne of mental and moral capabilities may be difficult to implement. However, in the light of the general inefficiency of other forms of censor ship, it can be considered the best, if not the only means of censorship. Perhaps it should be noted that self-regulation is best when administered alongside other forms of censorship, each reinforcing the impact of censorship of the other. The only other means of censorship to control people, perhaps, is complete arbitrary control by a single dominant authority, but that would result in a \u201czombified\u201d people \u2013 sluggish and uncreative mentally, and forever backward in innovations and development.\nPerhaps here self-regulation\u2019s greatest benefit is shown: borne of the individuals\u2019 own discernment and moral code, it not only trains the individual in mental toughness and resolution, it allows a wide lassitude for the entrance of new, stimulating ideas, allowing the individual to become well-rounded and complete in his intellectual accomplishments.",

External censorship often involves rigid, one-size-fits-all rules that do not take into account the complexity and diversity of different situations and cultures. In contrast, self-censorship allows for more flexibility and discretion in determining what should be censored and how. This can enable individuals or groups to adapt to changing social or political contexts while also respecting the needs and opinions of different stakeholders. For example, in the realm of social media or online communities, users can develop their own norms and rules of conduct that reflect their shared values and interests, while also allowing for dissent and debate.\n\nDespite the many advantages of self-regulation, there are also some challenges and limitations that need to be addressed. One major concern is that self-censorship may be imposed through social pressure or intimidation rather than genuine introspection or reflection. This can lead to a chilling effect on free expression, where individuals or groups are deterred from expressing themselves or exploring new ideas for fear of being ostracized or attacked. Another concern is that self-regulation may not be effective in situations where there is a power imbalance between different stakeholders, such as when corporations or governments have a dominant influence over media or information flows.\n\nDespite these concerns, I believe that self-regulation remains the most desirable and effective means of censorship in a democratic society. This is because it embodies key democratic values such as autonomy, responsibility, and collective decision-making, while also enabling individuals and communities to balance competing interests and needs.

Moreover, self-regulation avoids the negative side effects of other forms of censorship, such as arousing human curiosity and promoting rebellion. However, self-regulation depends on an individual's character and integrity, and this may be a weak point, as the failure of these traits may make self-regulation ineffective.

Self-regulation takes the opposite approach, whereby it fosters the individual\u2019s sense of propriety and responsibility for his own actions. He regulates himself in an appropriate manner, consistent with all social codes and standards-based on responsibility and not on coercion.\nHowever, the effectiveness of self-regulation is highly dependent on an individual. Not all people have the same level of discipline and control over their curiosity and impulses. This may lead to indulgence in prohibited materials, which is a violation of self-imposed rules and guidelines. The threat of punishment for violating the codes is slim since it is up to the individual to impose the punishment on themselves.\nIn conclusion, self-regulation is perhaps the only means to censorship if that system is to be successful. The externally administered disciplinary measures lack effectiveness due to the diversified information sources in society, coupled with the human traits that incline people to popular work. Self-regulation, however, is not completely effective since it depends solely on the individual, and some people may lack the necessary discipline and control. Nevertheless, the newfound sense of responsibility and sense of inherent propriety are essential in fostering an individual who is sensitive to the existing social norms and conventions.",

Its strength lies in its omnipresence and the individual\u2019s own desire for self-control, which makes it the most difficult form of censorship to subvert. However, it is important to note that self-regulation is dependent on an individual\u2019s character and integrity, which can be compromised or lost, making it an imperfect means of censorship.

This reduces the likelihood of rebelliousness and aggression towards authority, as the individual is exercising his own free will to avoid such materials, rather than being denied access to them by someone else.\nIn conclusion, self-regulation may indeed be the only means of censorship that is truly effective in achieving its intended purpose. While other means of censorship may appear to be practical on the surface, they inevitably face challenges and difficulties that render them inadequate in the long run. Self-regulation, however, is deeply ingrained in the individual and functions continually to protect him from external influences.

It seems evident that the one form of censorship that would be most effective given the current state of society is self-regulation because it is the only means of censorship that can truly guarantee the elimination of undesirable information from a person\u2019s mind.

External censorship mechanisms can be slow and bureaucratic, with decision-making processes that may be prone to errors or biases. Self-regulation, on the other hand, can be more agile and adaptable, as individuals and organizations can respond quickly to emerging issues, concerns, or feedback. For example, in the internet industry, self-regulation in the form of community guidelines or content moderation policies can help to deal with issues such as hate speech, fake news, or harmful content, while also respecting the diversity of opinions and cultures.\n\nOf course, self-regulation is not a panacea, and there may be situations where external censorship mechanisms are necessary to protect important public interests. When faced with issues such as national security, public safety, or extreme hate speech, external regulation may be needed to ensure that the greater good is served. However, even in such cases, external censorship should be done with utmost care and respect for human rights, democratic principles, and transparency.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship is a complex and challenging issue, self-regulation is arguably the most desirable and effective means of ensuring responsible and respectful expression, without compromising on individual rights and freedoms. By promoting a culture of responsibility, accountability, and responsiveness, self-regulation can help to create a more vibrant, pluralistic, and harmonious society, where different voices and perspectives can coexist and flourish.",

External censorship mechanisms can be slow, bureaucratic, and insensitive to local needs and realities, especially in the context of the online environment. By contrast, self-regulation can be more nimble and agile, and can adjust to new challenges and opportunities more quickly and efficiently. For example, social media platforms can use self-regulation methods such as content moderation policies and community standards to prevent the spread of hate speech, misinformation, and harmful content, while also respecting the freedom of expression and the diversity of views.\n\nHowever, while self-regulation can be a powerful means of censorship, it is not without its limitations and risks. One major concern is the potential for abuse or conflicts of interest among the self-regulatory bodies or individuals. Without proper checks and balances, self-censorship can become an instrument of oppression, manipulation, or bias. Moreover, there may be cases where external censorship is necessary to protect fundamental rights or to prevent serious harm, such as in the cases of child pornography, incitement to violence, or terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, while external censorship may be necessary in some extreme cases, self-regulation is generally a preferable means of censorship, as it is more aligned with the values of responsibility, accountability, and participation. By empowering individuals and organizations to regulate themselves, we can foster a more vibrant, diverse, and resilient society, where freedom of expression coexists with social responsibility and respect for human dignity.",

With technological advancements and the proliferation of social media platforms, traditional forms of censorship may become outdated or irrelevant. By contrast, self-regulation can be more responsive to emerging issues and trends because it is rooted in a shared understanding of what is appropriate and beneficial for the community. This flexibility can help to prevent unintended consequences such as over-regulation, under-regulation, or unintended bias. For example, self-regulation in online communities can be more effective than heavy-handed government regulations because it can empower users to make informed decisions about how to interact with others, while also developing creative and effective ways to address problems such as cyberbullying, hate speech, or misinformation.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship may sometimes be necessary to protect critical values or interests, self-regulation represents the most effective and desirable form of censorship. By empowering individuals and organizations to take responsibility for their actions, promoting creativity and innovation, and fostering greater flexibility and adaptability, self-regulation can strike the right balance between freedom of expression and social responsibility.

For example, online communities and social media platforms may develop their own moderation policies based on user feedback and evolving social norms, which can be more effective and efficient than top-down regulations imposed by governments or industry bodies.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that self-regulation is not without its limitations. One key challenge is the risk of capture or manipulation by vested interests, which may seek to distort or suppress certain types of expression that challenge their power or agenda. Moreover, self-regulation may not be effective in cases where there is a power imbalance or social inequality, where certain groups are more vulnerable to abuse or exploitation than others.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship may sometimes be necessary to protect public interest and safety, self-regulation is the most desirable form of censorship as it is aligned with democratic values, promotes responsibility and accountability, and allows for greater flexibility and adaptability.

This can enable timely and appropriate responses to emerging challenges, such as the spread of fake news or hate speech, without sacrificing the broader values of free expression and diversity. For example, social media platforms have increasingly adopted self-regulatory measures, such as content moderation policies and community guidelines, in response to growing public concerns about online harms.\n\nHowever, self-regulation is not a panacea, and there are risks and limitations associated with it. One major risk is that self-censorship can create conformism, groupthink, and chilling effects, as individuals or organizations fear the repercussions of expressing dissenting views or engaging in controversial speech. This can lead to a narrowing of perspectives, a stifling of creativity, and a weakening of democratic deliberation and exchange. In addition, self-regulation may not be effective in situations where power imbalances exist, where there is a lack of trust or cooperation among stakeholders, or where there are entrenched interests or biases.\n\nIn conclusion, while censorship may be necessary to protect important values and interests, the most desirable and effective form of censorship is self-regulation. Self-regulation enables censorship to be aligned with the values and interests of affected parties, promotes creativity and innovation, and allows for flexibility and responsiveness to changing circumstances.

            "human_gen_truncate": " Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) be tween the United States and Russia augurs well for world peace.\nEven though critics may argue that a subsequent effect of this is the purchasing of arms by Third World countries, we should not be unduly worried. This is because as many of the weaker countries arm themselves in defense, aggressor nations will be effectively deterred from waging wars. Hence, this redistribution of military might will serve to implement a new world balance of power and probably reduce the chances of a major war.\nAnother reason for optimism is the increasing importance of international trade in our world. As competition for trade intensifies with the rise of many developing countries, countries have never been as reliant on economic co-operation. This helps to divert attention from differences and also allows nations to be open to one another. Moreover, isolation from the global community. would be catastrophic and this subsequently allows space for international diplomacy and pressure to be applied in the name of peace. For instance, North Korea\u2019s initial stand of indifference over the inspection of its nuclear facilities was softened after promises of economic aid, thus removing an impending nuclear crisis.\nFurthermore, with increasing standards of education, many people are learning the need for acceptance and integration with other races and religious groups. The vehement opposition to Neo-Nazis in Germany and the political breakthrough made in Israel-Arab relations are evidence of this. This development has greatly down played racism and ultra-nationalism, ensuring global understanding.\nIn conclusion, the world will always remain under the threat of a global conflict. Peace-keeping efforts should be maintained and complacency must never be allowed to develop. With these in points mind, recent developments should have reduced the likelihood of a Third World War.",

With the major powers so heavily invested in the conflicts in Syria and Ukraine, any misstep in these two areas could trigger an all-out conflict.\n\nThe development of new technology is another factor that could make a Third World War increasingly likely. The proliferation of cyber-attacks has already started to cause significant damage. The WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017, which affected systems in countries such as the UK, Russia, and China, highlighted the potential for cybercrime to cause harm on a global scale. Furthermore, there are concerns that artificial intelligence could be used to develop autonomous weapons that could operate with minimal human intervention. This could lead to a dystopian future where the inherent lack of understanding and emotions in machines could lead to acts of aggression that would be counterproductive to human survival.\n\nHowever, as dangerous as these developments are, it is important to note that a Third World War is not inevitable. Diplomacy, mutual respect, and dialogue are the key to preventing a global conflict. Nations need to work together, not against each other, in order to solve the challenges facing the world. That means respecting the global rules-based system and working towards international cooperation. The world needs to remember that there are no true winners in a war, only losers.\n\nIn conclusion, recent world developments have made a Third World War more likely. The rise of populist leaders, regional conflicts, the arms race, and new technologies all threaten to undermine the stability of the world order. It is up to the leaders of the world to recognize the danger and work together to prevent a global conflict. As the global community looks ahead to the future of humanity, it is clear that a Third World War would be devastating for all involved.

This is an important development as it reduces the likelihood of nuclear war, which could have catastrophic effects on the world. While there are still some nations that continue to pursue weapons of mass destruction, the efforts of international communities to curb their development have been successful so far.\nDespite these positive developments, there are still reasons to be cautious about the possibility of a Third World War. For instance, the rise of nationalism, populism and extremist ideologies in various parts of the world could pose a threat to global peace. Additionally, there are ongoing conflicts in regions such as the Middle East, North Korea and the South China Sea that could potentially escalate into full-blown wars.\nIn conclusion, while recent world developments have reduced the likelihood of a global war, it is important that we do not become complacent. We need to remain vigilant and work towards promoting international co-operation and reducing tensions between nations. Only then can we ensure a peaceful and secure world for future generations.",

Furthermore, the rise of economic interdependence between countries is rapidly making war ever more costly, with serious consequences for all the involved parties. A global conflict that would involve major economic powers would likely harm the entire international system.\nHowever, there remain many regional and local conflicts that continue to pose a threat. These conflicts are usually sparked by poverty, ethnic or religious differences, and other forms of inequality, causing violence, instability and even nationalistic ambitions. Additionally, recent advancements in technology present another threat as new military equipment and cyber warfare technology increase in sophistication. Furthermore, growing geopolitical rivalries and territorial disputes between great powers pose a worrying trend in international relations.\nIn conclusion, while the threat of a global war cannot be entirely ruled out, the world is becoming increasingly connected, and many efforts continue to be made towards maintaining world peace. As long as international co-operation is maintained, regional conflicts are resolved, and great powers continue to exercise restraint and work towards common goals, the threat of a Third World War can be avoided. Nonetheless, we should not be complacent and be always ready to handle any potential crisis using diplomatic and peaceful means.",

Additionally, the proliferation of nuclear weapons to states with unstable governments is being monitored and curtailed, preventing the possibility of such weapons falling into the wrong hands.\nHowever, it is undeniable that there are still conflicts around the world that threaten global stability. The ongoing situation in the Korean peninsula, tensions between India and Pakistan, and conflicts in the Middle East remain major causes for concern. The recent emergence of new superpowers, such as China and India, also creates new political and economic tensions that could escalate into military conflicts.\nIn conclusion, while recent world developments have certainly posed new challenges to global stability, it is important to recognise that significant progress has also been made towards peace and international co-operation. While the possibility of a Third World War cannot be entirely dismissed, the concerted efforts of the international community in maintaining peace and resolving conflicts gives us cause for optimism.",

Countries are now becoming more conscious of the importance of disarmament. This spirit of disarmament has led to the signing of many non-proliferation treaties, which bar countries from developing nuclear, biological or chemical weapons. Countries are slowly coming to realise that the possession of such weapons is not as important as the peaceful co-existence of humanity.\n\nLastly, the advancements in technology have also played a significant role in making the reality of World War III a distant possibility. Modern technology like the internet and social media have brought the world together, making it easy to exchange ideas and communicate globally. This increases the likelihood of resolving disputes before they can escalate into military conflicts. The growth of the global economy has also created interdependence between nations, which makes it unwise for any country to engage in a global conflict as it would adversely affect the economies of all countries, including the conflicting ones.\n\nIn conclusion, while some recent events may suggest that a Third World War is more likely, a careful examination of global relations suggests otherwise. The world has learnt from the past, and there is an increased consciousness of the importance of maintaining peace and promoting co-existence. International organisations like the United Nations have also made it possible to resolve conflicts in a peaceful manner, and advancements in technology have further decreased the likelihood of global military conflicts.",

This reduction has gone a long way to reducing tensions and the potential - albeit remote - of a global arms race. Additionally, the Missile Technology Control Regime, which limits the export of sensitive missile technology, has also helped to limit global arms proliferation.\nHowever, it may be argued that there are other developments that could potentially trigger an all-out global war in the long run. For instance, the ongoing territorial disputes in the South China Sea, the current spat between North Korea and America and the ongoing conflicts in Syria and Iraq have the potential to spiral out of control and trigger a global war. Furthermore, the rise of nationalist movements in different parts of the world, coupled with population displacement due to conflicts or climate change, could lead to destabilisation of states and create new strains that could trigger global conflict.\nIn conclusion, it is pertinent to note that while there are various developments that could make the Third World War a possibility, significant progress in civilisation in the last 50 years has given reason to be optimistic. The world has progressed in terms of international co-operation, disarmament and conflict resolution; although not perfect, and there remain unsolved conflicts, these developments provide assurance that the threat of a global war is diminishing. The international community needs to sustain these efforts to ensure continued peace and stability.",
                "United States and Russia have signed a series of arms control agreements to reduce their nuclear stockpiles significantly. Additionally, the trend of non-proliferation has taken root, paving the way for countries to sign on to international treaties, such as the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT). By reducing the number of nuclear warheads in the world, the probability of a global-scale military confrontation is significantly lowered.\nHowever, recent world developments like the rise of global terrorism, increasing tension between major powers, and the proliferation of non-state actors possessing nuclear weapons, has brought about the possibility of a future global conflict. The conflict between the United States and Iran over nuclear weapons, for instance, has increased the likelihood of a military conflict in the Middle East, which could drag other major powers into the fray. Additionally, with the increasing adoption of cyberwarfare capabilities and the development of new technologies like autonomous weapons systems, the possibility of conflict taking an unprecedented and catastrophic turn cannot be ignored.\nIn conclusion, world developments have created both risks and opportunities for the prospect of global conflict. While significant progress has been made in reducing the likelihood of a Third World War, current political and technological trends suggest that there is a need for continued vigilance and international cooperation to avoid such an outcome.",

Increasingly, nations are beginning to recognise the merits of disarmament and the benefits of peaceful relations. Furthermore, technological advances in surveillance and early warning systems have greatly contributed to the ease in reducing hostilities between nations, as potential conflicts can be identified early and nipped in the bud.\nWhile the possibility of a Third World War cannot be completely ruled out, the present trend of global co-operation, disarmament, and initiatives aimed at maintaining international peace render it unlikely. Despite recent developments in world politics, the creation of new power blocs, and the occurrence of regional conflicts, I believe that the world is now more united than ever before. In essence, I believe that only through dialogue, trust, and international goodwill can lasting world peace be achieved.",

Furthermore, the development of nuclear weapons by rogue nations is being closely monitored by the international community, and stiff sanctions are put in place to deter such nations from pursuing their nuclear ambitions. This is a clear signal that the world is united in its effort to prevent a global arms race and prevent a catastrophic Third World War.\nHowever, there are still areas of the world that remain volatile and pose a threat to global peace. Recent tensions between North Korea and the US, the conflicts in the Middle East, and the continued rise of extremist groups such as ISIS, all contribute to the perception that a Third World War is becoming more likely. However, it is important to remember that such conflicts are being dealt with on an international level, and there are many diplomatic efforts in place to address these issues.\nIn conclusion, while recent world developments have certainly contributed to tensions and conflicts, the world is now better equipped to deal with these issues than in previous generations. With the UN as an effective mediator, the reduction of global arms, and the expansion of international co-operation, the possibility of a Third World War is increasingly remote. It is important to continue to work towards global peace and unity, in order to maintain the sustainable development of the world and avoid catastrophic consequences.",
                "United States and Russia have significantly reduced their nuclear arsenals, and at the same time, signed major disarmament agreements. This reduction in arms gives the world a glimpse of hope for disarmament and peace. Moreover, the advanced weapons possessed by many countries today are deemed too powerful to be used. It is the general consensus of many countries today that any conflict will no longer be fought on a global scale, but on a regional level, if at all. This means that armed conflicts are more likely to be contained and brought under control, thereby reducing the possibility of a third world war.\nIn conclusion, while recent world developments may seem to suggest a possible shift towards a third world war, international co-operation and peace efforts have greatly reduced the probability of such a catastrophe. Disarmament talks, inter-national trade, and major political and ideological agreements have all significantly contributed to global peace. The protection and promotion of world peace is crucial and it is up to every citizen of the world to contribute in their small ways towards this goal, to ensure that the world continues to remain a peaceful and harmonious place for all."

As we have seen in history, when nations face economic crises, they often turn to nationalism, which can lead to a rise in militarism. Additionally, scarce resources such as oil or water may become more valuable as the world population continues to grow, leading to competition and conflict over these resources.\n\nIn conclusion, recent world developments have indeed made a Third World War more likely. The world needs to be vigilant and leaders should be held accountable for their actions, especially those that have the potential to escalate tensions. It is essential that there is open communication and cooperation between nations to deescalate conflicts and prevent conflicts from escalating. A global war would have catastrophic consequences, both for our generation and those to come."

The world today is troubled by too many conflicting players and voices and no effective international leadership, Grouping the various individual countries into regional blocs with one voice will undoubtedly help lessen the chaos of today\u2019s international political scene. However, such a goal is not easily achieved for there is often disagreement among regional group members themselves, such as within the EC and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nMilitary cooperation between regional countries will also help put a dampening pressure on any rising aggressive sentiments of a foreign country. This will help discourage the outbreak of wars of aggression and contribute towards international peace. Political cooperation within the region will also help promote internal stability within each member country. Dissident factions within each country may be less prone towards militant rebellion, knowing that they will face the censure of the region.\nLast, but not least, regional cooperation will mean faster, more efficient aid to members in times of disaster. Within the ASEAN community, aid, in the form of medicine and trained rescue workers is sent by other members to the disaster-plagued member immediately once assistance is asked for. Such regional help arrives faster than any international aid, which may take a longer time to mobilise.\nHence, there is a need for regional cooperation.

Through regional cooperation, countries can share best practices and knowledge on issues such as education, health, and social welfare. They can also work together to address social challenges such as poverty, inequality, and gender discrimination. The ASEAN Socio-Cultural Community (ASCC) is working to achieve these goals in Southeast Asia by promoting human development, social welfare, and gender equality in the region.\n\nFinally, regional cooperation can promote political stability and regional integration. It fosters mutual understanding and trust among countries, leading to better diplomatic relations, which in turn can lead to a more stable political environment. In recent years, the ASEAN Political-Security Community (APSC) has been working to enhance regional integration and deepen the community-building process in Southeast Asia.\n\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is essential in today's world. It promotes economic growth, security, environmental management, social progress, and political stability. These benefits demonstrate how vital it is for nations to work collaboratively to solve global issues.

This is particularly important in regions that are prone to conflicts and instability, and where external interference can exacerbate tensions.\nIn conclusion, the need for regional cooperation today is clear as it brings about benefits such as greater economic efficiency, increased employment opportunities and the promotion of regional stability and security.

Examples include the establishment of the ASEAN Regional Forum, which provides a platform for East Asian nations to discuss political and security issues and the ASEAN Declaration on the South China Sea, which promotes peaceful settlement of territorial disputes in the area.\nTherefore, in today's world, regional cooperation is more important than ever.

In Southeast Asia, where resources are scarce and territorial disputes exist, cooperation among the countries is necessary to ensure mutual security. The presence of regional groupings such as ASEAN helps to prevent conflicts among member countries and also prevent the escalation of conflicts between members and other countries outside the region. In addition, disaster management and environmental issues are also best tackled in a regional context. Regional groupings can coordinate efforts and resources to minimize the impact of natural disasters such as tsunamis and earthquakes, and also to tackle environmental problems such as haze and pollution.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is essential in today\u2019s globalised world. It brings economic benefits, enhances security, and serves as a platform for tackling important issues such as disaster management and environmental protection.

By establishing a platform for dialogue, misunderstandings and misjudgments can be avoided, and peaceful resolution to conflicts can be achieved.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is important in the present day, especially in regards to economic cooperation.

Additionally, in the face of problems such as natural disasters, member countries can assist each other more easily and quickly by sharing manpower and resources. This is because regional cooperation would have established mutual trust and a sense of belongingness among the member countries.\nIn conclusion, there is indeed a need for regional cooperation today.

For example, ASEAN has been working towards creating a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality in the Southeast Asian region. This can only be achieved if countries in the region commit to settle disputes through peaceful means, cooperate in defence matters and respect each other's sovereignty.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is necessary in today's context as it leads to more efficient resource utilization, stimulates economic growth and can contribute to the maintenance of regional stability.

If there is regional unrest or conflicts, trade and economic activities will be disrupted. It is therefore in the best interest of all member countries to cooperate in maintaining regional peace and stability.\nIn conclusion, regional cooperation is necessary in today\u2019s interconnected world. National self-interests should not be allowed to interfere with the long-term benefits of regional cooperation, whether it is for economic, political or security reasons.

It was this helicopter vision and faith in his choice that led Mr CK Tang to be one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Singapore. Good entrepreneurs should emulate this striking example.\nI also think that shrewdness must be an inherent quality in a good entrepreneur. This is because in business there will be certain subtle advantages and traps which must be discerned by a shrewd entrepreneur and used to his best advantage. If an entrepreneur cannot detect these subtleties, it is unlikely that he will be able to succeed because he is handicapped in the ability to grasp golden opportunities.\nA good entrepreneur must be shrewd enough to anticipate beneficial changes and grasp them. He must be prepared for certain danger and treachery and avoid falling into business traps that may ruin him. With shrewd ness, and an opportunistic nature, a good entrepreneur is always one step ahead of others in the competitive business world and thus is on his way up the ladder of success.\nInterpersonal skills are also important for a good entrepreneur.

            "human_gen_truncate": "n dispense with space. This magical aspect of art should be something we must treasure, and not simply label it as some pernicious and undesirable.\nArt epitomises man\u2019s wisdom and his innate ability to put his ideas thoughts and perceptions into evocative symbols or representatives that transmit certain meaningful messages. Undoubtedly, it enhances interaction between people in the sense that people can communicate through time and space through those art pieces and works. With out art, interpersonal relationships can never be fostered, since all of people\u2019s endeavours and pursuits would be centred or based on materialistic attainments and sati faction. Therefore, art is useful to us in that it closes the gap and fills up the chasm between people, thus bringing them together. Of course, one need not be sensitive, erudite or have the minds or eyes of a connoisseur to appreciate art. In fact, art is all around us, and even in its most pristine and simplest form, it can make us realize that there is a value to living, depending only on whether we are observant or not. Thus, art has a value and that value often manifests itself in its usefulness.\nOf course, there are some forms of art that do not enhance our lives, but have detrimental effects on us. Examples of these are pornography and unhealthy drawings, caricatures and portrayals that are done for defamatory or inflammatory purposes or to arouse and stimulate those undesirable feelings latent in us. In addition, decadent music will lead to degeneracy that have adverse psycho logical influences on the individual. These forms of art should definitely not be encouraged and propagated among the masses. But they constitute only a minor portion of all those things encompassed in the realm and sphere of art. Oscar Wilde\u2019s \u201cAll art is useless\u201d is certainly an overstatement and implies an attitude too intransigient. The word \u2018Art\u2019 and its contents should not be seen as totally useless or even sordid just because some forms of art are useless, or are to some extent, undesirable due to the fact that their degree of utilization is limited and their nature questionable.\nSince art has been passed on from one generation to generation another, it is apparent to us that unless it possesses certain qualities that are worth preserving, it could not have became the legacy of mankind. With due consideration to this, should we look at the picture from a broad perspective and recognise its real value and use fulness instead of combing it inch by inch for its flaws and stigmas?",
            "machine_gen_truncate": "at supports the belief that art is useless is that it does not have a specific function in society. Unlike science or technology, which offer practical solutions to real-life problems, art does not have an explicit function in society. It does not produce anything tangible and does not generate direct profits. However, it leaves intangible and long-lasting impressions on human beings. Art has the power to inspire, to challenge, to motivate, and to enrich our lives. It can change our perspectives and offer new insights into the world around us.\n\nFurthermore, Wilde implies that the value of art lies in its beauty and aesthetic qualities rather than its usefulness. Therefore, the value of art cannot be measured by its instrumental purpose or by the benefits it provides. It is not something that justifies its existence through its utility. Instead, Wilde argues that art is valuable because of its ability to evoke emotions, express ideas, challenge conventions, and stimulate the imagination. It is the experience of art that makes it meaningful, rather than its material effects. The aesthetic qualities of art transcend utility, making it something that has intrinsic value.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that \"all art is useless\" might initially seem contentious, but upon reflection, one can see that it is a profound truth about the nature of art. Art is not meant to serve any practical purpose; it is created purely for the sake of itself. The value and meaning of art lie in its ability to evoke emotions and express ideas rather than its utility. Therefore, art critics and enthusiasts should not view art merely through its instrumental value but should admire its aesthetic qualities and appreciate the unique experiences it provides.

In fact, art is so ingrained in our lives that it has become a part of us. Art brings happiness, joy, and meaning to our lives, and serves as a beacon of hope in the darkest of times.

However, to truly appreciate the value of art, we need to understand that there is more to life than just the pursuit of material goods. Art is the essence of our humanity, and it enriches our lives in ways that cannot be quantified by money or productivity.

Art has also been used as a means to inspire change and action towards a better world. For example, art related to environmental issues has become increasingly popular, with artists raising awareness about climate change and the need to preserve the earth.\nTherefore, it is apparent that art is far from being useless. Art plays a remarkable role in our society and offers numerous benefits. It enriches the quality of life, serves as a platform to express opinions and ideas, and brings people together. It enables us to express our visions and thoughts in a unique way, and helps us understand and appreciate the world around us.

Nonetheless, even these pieces of \"useless\" art have value in bringing pleasure and joy to individuals. It is essential to recognize that art provides emotional rejuvenation and a healing touch for the wounded soul.\n\nIn conclusion, art has a complex and diverse purpose. It can be useful as a means of income, a medium of creating personal growth and expression, and a source of beauty and inspiration.

Instead, it plays a vital and meaningful role in our lives by adding colour and depth to our experiences, providing an avenue for self-expression, and serving as a testament to the boundless creativity and ingenuity of human beings.

When art becomes a commodity, it loses its essential qualities, such as its emotional and aesthetic appeal.\n\nIn conclusion, Oscar Wilde's statement that \"All art is useless\" may seem to be a radical assertion. However, when we examine the true intent behind his words, we can see that he believed that art should not be judged by its practical use but rather by its aesthetic and emotional appeal. Art transcends the boundaries of practicality and exists for its own sake. Therefore, art should be valued and appreciated for its unique qualities and not just for its practicality."

Even today, this idea is deep-rooted in many people\u2019s minds and therefore fewer women than men work and thus women make a smaller economic contribution to the country and to their families. In the Third World countries, women usually work for more hours than men but despite this fact, they are still seen as the weaker sex as they are paid very little for their work, that is, if they are paid at all. In certain countries such as India, traditional marriage customs have it that the woman\u2019s family has to pay a huge dowry to the husband for the husband to take care of the wife, indicating that the wife is incapable of taking care of herself. In other countries such as European countries, should a marriage end in divorce, the husband is often required to pay alimony to the wife as it is thought that the wife may be unable to survive independently. For centuries, husbands were the breadwinners. Today, even though more women are going out to work, the wives still get allowances from their husbands, who felt that it is their responsibility to provide for their wives, who are the weaker sex.\nIn the past, women were not allowed to participate in politics as they were considered incapable of handling such matters. Even today, far fewer women are active in politics than men. The Prime Minister of Pakistan is one of the few. In Singapore, there is only one female member in the parliament (that has change since. Halimah was sworn in on 14 September 2017 as the 8th President at The Istana.) Much of this situation can be attributed to the sensitive and emotional nature of women which renders them less suitable candidates for politics as they are more prone to mix feelings with work. On the other hand, however, women are more caring and have keener minds which allows them to observe an issue from many different points of view and thus to make better decisions on the best action to take. However, even though women have this advantage, not many women are willing to go into politics and also few people, especially men, are able to accept female leaders. As such, women are the weaker sex.\nIn conclusion, women can be seen to be weaker than men in physical, psychological, economic and political aspects. It can also be seen that men have more advantages over women than women have over men and this is further reinforced by traditional attitudes (that women are weaker) which are still deep-rooted in most societies.",

This shows that women can excel in any field as long as they are given equal opportunities and a level playing field.\n\nMoreover, women have demonstrated exceptional strength and resilience in the face of adversity. Women have historically been subjected to various forms of violence, including rape, domestic abuse, and sex trafficking. However, despite these obstacles, women have displayed immense strength by refusing to be silenced and fighting for their rights. Additionally, women have shown their strength through their ability to multitask. Women are known to juggle multiple responsibilities, such as raising children, pursuing their careers, and managing their households.\n\nIn conclusion, the notion that women are the weaker sex is outdated and has been disproven by the strides women have made in various fields. While men may have physical strength, women have demonstrated their strength in numerous ways. It is time to recognize the immense potential of women and provide them with equal opportunities to realize their full potential.

Women are also more likely to be employed in lower-paying jobs. This trend may be attributed to the traditional perception that women are more suited for soft skills such as caretaking and communication whereas men are better in leadership and hard skills. This perception is slowly being challenged by modern society and initiatives to close the gender pay gap are being taken by various organizations and countries around the world.\nIn terms of political power, women are also seen as the weaker sex since there are fewer women in leadership positions compared to men. In many countries, women still hold traditional roles as caretakers of the home and family, which limits their ability to enter the political sphere.

Many women have to balance work with traditional gender roles of being a caregiver and often face employment discrimination due to their gender and marital status. This can lead to financial dependence on their male counterparts, making them appear weaker in the economic sense. However, this is not due to their inherent weakness as women, but rather societal and systemic biases against them.\nLastly, women are also under-represented in the political arena.

It is the rural people who are the most vulnerable to this disease since the lack of edu cation causes them to be ignorant of the ways of trans mission of AIDS. As I have mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is already hard for the rural poor to obtain a basic education about the prevention of AIDS.\nThe more developed countries definitely have a higher literacy rate than the developing ones. However, this does not mean complacency can be allowed to set in here. The government of the United States of America, for example, has realised that it is now time to do something about its educational system which is plagued with a drop in standards. Critics have condemned the system in which students are assessed using multiple choice questions which they say do not fully test the students\u2019 abilities and intelligence.\nI see the need for governments to let education be their first concern. In the case of developing countries like India, the government should ensure that education is available and affordable for the young. They should improve the infrastructure in the rural areas so that the poor can easily reached by teachers and so schools can be built. A large pool of illiterate young people is inevitably detrimental to the economy and progress of the nation. It is also a waste of human resources.

In a democratic society, an educated populace is better able to hold their leaders accountable and ensure that they act in the best interest of the people.\n\nFourthly, education improves public health outcomes. A well-educated population exhibits better health outcomes due to their increased awareness of healthy practices. For instance, education promotes good hygiene, sensible diets, regular exercise, and responsible sexual behavior, all of which result in better health outcomes. A well-educated populace is also better equipped to understand and cope with public health threats, such as pandemics, as they have an understanding of science and medicine.\n\nConversely, if a government fails to prioritize education, the consequences can be dire. A poorly educated society exhibits acute economic disparities and high unemployment rates, which can lead to social unrest and increased crime rates. Moreover, when the population is not educated, their ability to participate in democratic governance is limited, resulting in a lack of accountability and corruption within the government. Additionally, a poorly educated society is more likely to exhibit poor health outcomes, leading to increased healthcare costs and difficulties in dealing with public health crises.\n\nIn conclusion, education is the cornerstone of any society.

This reflects a common problem that many developing countries face, that is, the need to balance the spending on defence and education.\nIn contrast, progressive countries like Singapore have made education a top priority. Singapore invests heavily in its education system, which is well known for its quality and effectiveness. Education is viewed as a means to uplift the standard of living of the population and provide them with better job prospects. The government seeks to prepare Singaporean students to meet the demands of the global economy. Singapore encourages lifelong learning so that its people are up-to-date with the latest developments in the world of work.\nIn conclusion, while different countries may have different priorities, I strongly believe that a government's first concern should always be the education of its people. A well-educated populace is the cornerstone of economic development, social progress, and national security. Through education, people can acquire knowledge and skills that can help them achieve success not only in their own lives, but also contribute to the progress of their country.",
                "labour is still a major problem in the country. Thus, India\u2019s obsession with defence hinders the country\u2019s development and growth.\nOn the other hand, countries that place greater emphasis on education are generally more developed and prosperous. Singapore is a case in point. Since independence, Singapore\u2019s government has made it a top priority to raise the standard of education among its youth. As a result, the country\u2019s literacy rate is almost 100 percent and she boasts of one of the most efficient education systems in the world. Today, Singapore is a thriving economy and a financial hub in the South East Asian region with her people enjoying a high standard of living. Thus, we can see that by prioritizing education, Singapore has reaped rich rewards in terms of development and prosperity.\nIn conclusion, I strongly believe that education should be the primary concern of any government. A good education system not only benefits the population but also contributes to the economic growth and development of a country. Therefore, a government should allocate sufficient resources and attention towards developing its education system for the betterment of its people and the nation as a whole.",
                "labour is still prevalent. This is because many poor families cannot afford to feed and clothe their children without their help. In such situations, one can only hope that the Indian government would place more emphasis on education in the future.\n\nIn contrast, let us take a look at a successful country such as Singapore. The Singapore government has always recognised the importance of education in nation building. Since independence, the government has spent enormously on education. Education is one of Singapore\u2019s top priorities and it is no surprise that the coun try boasts one of the best education systems in the world. The government realises that education has to be relevant to the needs and aspirations of the people. For example, since the 1960s, there has been a big shift in the emphasis of education from the humanities to the sciences. This shift was made because of the pressing needs of a small country like Singapore where most of the jobs need technical expertise. In stead of emphasising classical literature and history, the education system focuses more on mathematics, science and technology which will be directly beneficial to the economy. This key emphasis on education has indirectly led to the success of today\u2019s Singapore. Singapore is almost totally dependent on her human resources. Since independence, the government has set out to create a highly skilled labour force which would provide the economic engine for the country\u2019s growth. Indeed, the spectacular economic success of Singapore in the last two decades has been attributed, among other things, to the quality of her labour force. \n\nIn conclusion, I strongly agree that education should be the foremost preoccupation of any government. An educated population is a prosperous population and a prosperous population is a peaceful population. Education is thus a vital element in the growth and development of any nation, since the ultimate success of a country lies not only in its natural resources but also in its people.",
                "labour remains rampant since many parents prefer taking their children out of school to work as child labourers to supplement their income. This vicious cycle perpetuates poverty, illiteracy and ignorance.\n\nTherefore, education should be a priority for any government because it is inextricably linked to economic growth, social stability and national prosperity. Education empowers individual citizens with knowledge and its practical applications and allows them to live a more fulfilling life, as well as to contribute effectively to the nation\u2019s human capital. More importantly, education of quality also provides a strong foundation for citizens to engage in lifelong learning, which in turn ensures their competitiveness in a rapidly-changing global economy.\n\nIn conclusion, the primary objective of any government should be the well-being of its citizens. And the best way to ensure that their needs are met is by prioritising education. By investing heavily in education, governments can effectively and efficiently lay the foundation for sustainable and equitable development, thereby building a better world for all.",
                "labour and the sheer competitiveness of the education system are major obstacles to progressing in education.\nIn contrast, countries like Singapore have placed education as a top priority. The People's Action Party and founding father, Lee Kuan Yew, recognised that education is the key to Singapore's success as a nation. Singapore invests heavily in education, with the government spending up to 20% of its annual budget on education. This investment extends from pre-school to tertiary education, ensuring that every Singaporean child has access to quality education, regardless of social or economic background. The country's education system is recognised globally, with Singaporean students consistently ranked amongst the top performers in international benchmarking tests.\nIn conclusion, education is vital to a country's development and progress, and it should be the first concern of any government. The education of a country's people forms the basis for its economic growth and development. Governments should, therefore, prioritise the development of education systems to ensure that all citizens have access to quality education and can contribute meaningfully to their country's growth and development.",
                "labour is still a common phenomenon in India. Children tend to drop out of schools in search of work to help support their families.\nOn the other hand, countries like Finland and South Korea have prioritised education as their top concern. As a result, they have some of the best-performing education systems in the world. Their governments have invested heavily in education and they have made it a right for all citizens to receive it. The impact of quality education can be seen in the economic growth of these countries and in the development of a knowledgeable and skilled workforce that drives innovation and advancement.\nIn conclusion, I believe that education is crucial for the development of any country. It is a powerful tool that can shape the future of nations and the lives of individuals. While there are different priorities for government spending, education should always be given the necessary attention and resources to ensure that citizens are equipped with the skills and knowledge needed to advance the economy and society as a whole."

            "human_gen_truncate": "ality, just because they do not look as appealing.\nThis phenomenon has many worrying implications. A recent article in \u201cUSA Today\u201d, an American periodical, stated that one of the major reasons Clinton won the Presidency was because he was more attractively pack aged (saxophone, blond wife, youthful looks and all) than older and more haggard-looking Bush. Among some of the reasons given for this prevailing emphasis on appearances was the impact that slick, glossy, stylish advertising has on the American population. So now you see how sinister advertising can be.\nMany people claim that advertising is an extremely wasteful industry. To some extent this is very true. With out all that money spent on air-time, research, and hiring of expensive models to advertise products and services, we consumers would pay a much lower price for the things we buy. Also, think of the adverse impact excessive packaging has on the environment. Valuable re sources are used wastefully to make a product look just a little bit better, and end up in landfills or incinerators.\nAdvertising, a multi-million industry, provides a basic function for several thousand people world-wide: that is jobs. For every hundred people that advertisements manipulate there is one bread-winner or wage-earner. Advertising is not as simple as enticing consumers to purchase a product it has a significant impact on the economy too!\nIf advertising can have an adverse impact on many consumers, it can also have a positive effect on more discerning people. What else provides the valuable lesson \u2013 beware of cheats and deceivers \u2013 day in day out? Advertising is a constant reminder to be more wary of insufficiently backed claims and stylish deviousness. People who learn these lessons well can make more intelligent choices and decisions in all areas of their lives.\nSo we see that advertising, in all its forms, makes a gigantic impact on our daily lives. Who would have thought that advertising would have such a wide-reaching and lasting influence?",

This type of advertising can create a detrimental image of what \u201cbeauty and attractiveness\u201d means, which can lead to a negative impact on self-esteem and acceptance of one's body image.\n\nAdditionally, advertising can be manipulative and misleading, particularly regarding health claims. Many companies make claims about their products that are not supported by scientific evidence or else use complex language to mislead consumers. This type of advertisement can deceive consumers into believing the advertised product is a miracle solution, leading to dangerous health outcomes in some instances.\n\nMoreover, advertising can contribute to the rise of consumerism and harmful environmental practices, leading to an issue of sustainability. Advertisements often encourage the over-consumption of goods and services, leading to an increase in waste and unsustainable production practices. In this way, advertising encourages customers to buy more even though they may not necessarily need them. This contributes to increased environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources.\n\nIn conclusion, advertising plays a significant role in our society. It has both positive and negative effects on individuals and society as a whole. While advertising helps promote products and businesses and helps consumers in making informed decisions, it can perpetuate harmful stereotypes, be manipulative in its claims, and contribute to environmental waste and unsustainable practices. Therefore, it is important for companies to consider the ethical implications of their advertising practices in developing advertisements that promote their products while still being responsible and sustainable in their messaging.",

This is a dangerous trend as it erodes the importance of substance and quality in our society, which should be the primary consideration when making purchasing decisions.\nFurthermore, advertising has also been criticised for its role in perpetuating harmful stereotypes and promoting unrealistic beauty standards. The use of airbrushing and photoshop to create flawless models in advertisements has distorted our perceptions of beauty, creating anxiety and insecurities for many, particularly young people. Advertisements have also been accused of perpetuating gender, race and class stereotypes, reinforcing harmful societal norms and contributing to discrimination and inequality.\nIn conclusion, while advertising may be a necessary component of our capitalist society, we should be aware of its impact on our thoughts, beliefs and behaviours. It is important to approach advertisements critically and with a discerning eye, and to resist the temptation to make purchasing decisions based solely on appearances. Ultimately, we should prioritize substance and quality over slick packaging and clever sales tactics.",

This is just one example of the impact advertising has on consumer behavior.\nAnother negative impact of advertising is the creation and perpetuation of stereotypes. Women are sexualized to sell products that have nothing to do with sexuality, while men are portrayed as aggressive and dominant. This can lead to the reinforcement of gender roles and unhealthy attitudes towards women.\nOn the positive side, advertising has enabled smaller businesses to compete with larger ones by giving them a platform to showcase their products and services. Advertising has also helped to raise awareness about important issues such as social causes and health concerns.\nIn conclusion, advertising has a significant impact on our lives, shaping our attitudes and behaviors in ways that may not always be positive. It is up to individuals to be aware of this impact and to make informed choices. As consumers, we have the power to choose what we buy and what we support, and it is important that we exercise this power responsibly.",

This relentless pursuit of material goods has become a benchmark of success and status, and it has driven people to accumulate more and more, leading to overconsumption.\nMoreover, advertising can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The images and messages portrayed in advertisements can reinforce gender, racial or class prejudices. Women are often depicted as objects of desire or as homemakers, while men are shown as strong and dominant. Minority groups may be stereotyped or excluded altogether. These messages can have a negative impact on self-esteem, especially among young people who are still developing a sense of identity.\nIn conclusion, advertising is a powerful force in our lives that can shape our beliefs, values and behaviour. While it can be a means of informing and persuading consumers, it can also have negative effects on our psyche and society as a whole. It is therefore important to be aware of its impact and to make informed choices about the products and services that we consume.",

Advertisements that feature scantily clad models or actors can lead to people feeling dissatisfied with their own bodies and can also perpetuate harmful stereotypes about gender roles and body image ideals. This is especially true for young people who are still developing their own sense of self-esteem and self-worth.\nIn conclusion, the impact of advertising is undeniable. While it can be a powerful tool for businesses to reach and attract customers, it also has a significant impact on our lives and society as a whole. It is important that we remain aware of its influence on our psyche and use our critical-thinking skills to ensure that we are not being led astray by slick sales pitches and false promises. Ultimately, we must strive to make informed decisions based on facts, not just on the catchy slogans and appealing images presented to us through advertisements.",

Thus, advertising has given rise to a culture of consumerism, where one\u2019s identity is defined by the products one purchases. This has led to increased materialism and a disregard for the environment and our planet's limited resources.\nFurthermore, advertising can also reinforce societal stereotypes. Many advertisements feature unrealistic body images that promote an unhealthy standard of beauty. This can lead to body shaming and unhealthy body image issues. Advertisements can also portray gender, race and ethnicity in stereotypical and discriminatory ways, leading to systemic prejudice and discrimination.\nIn conclusion, advertising has a powerful impact on our culture, our values and our behaviours. It has the power to shape our self-identities, perpetuate harmful stereotypes and promote consumerism.

This leads to disappointment and disillusionment when the purchased product falls short of expectations, and also contributes to our materialistic culture.\nAnother aspect of advertising that needs to be considered is the effect it has on our self-esteem. Many advertisements try to convince us that we are missing out on something important, that our lives will be incomplete without their particular product or service. This manipulative strategy can erode our confidence and lead to insecurity and a constant need to seek approval through consumer goods.\nIn conclusion, advertising is a ubiquitous and powerful force in our society, with far-reaching effects on our psychological and emotional well-being. While it may be too idealistic to expect that advertising will disappear completely, it is important to recognise its negative influences and strive to resist manipulation and make informed choices as consumers.",
                "ality. This shallow emphasis on aesthetics leads to a world where everything looks good, but how much of it actually is?\nAdditionally, advertising also manipulates us into creating unnecessary demands. It convinces us that we need a shiny new car, an expensive watch, or the latest smartphone just to keep up with the times. This consumption-driven mentality fuels a cycle where we are always craving new products and services, often beyond our means.\nDespite the drawbacks, advertising is not all bad. It can also serve as a powerful tool for informing and educating the public. For example, public health campaigns can utilise advertisements to promote healthy eating or the dangers of smoking. In this way, advertising can benefit society by spreading important messages and raising awareness on critical issues.\nIn conclusion, advertising has a profound impact on our lives, influencing our perceptions and driving our consumption patterns. While we must be conscious of its drawbacks, it is also important to acknowledge its potential for good. By balancing the benefits and drawbacks of advertising, we can maximise its potential for positive change while minimising the harm it can cause.",

The average person is now subjected to 5,000 to 10,000 advertising messages daily, mostly in the form of visual images. This has led to a desensitisation towards advertising that in turn has led to the escalating trend of shock-tactics in advertising.\nLastly, another impact of advertising is its role in shaping societal values. Contrary to popular belief, advertising is not a reflection of societal values, but rather a source of it. Advertisers have long used visual cues, humour and even sex to shape the way people think, feel and act. The depiction of women in advertisements as passive, vulnerable and dependent on men for their happiness has contributed to the sexualisation of society. Advertising messages encouraging the consumption of alcohol and tobacco has contributed to the normalisation of these behaviours within our society.\nIn conclusion, the impact of advertising has been immense. While it has granted us access to information on goods and services that we may have never known of otherwise, advertising has also affected our psyche in more ways than we can ever know. It has contributed to a superficial, materialistic culture that values image over substance and has shaped societal values and norms.",
                "ality. This is especially true for the younger generation, who are continually exposed to flashy and appealing advertisements promoting the latest gadgets or trendy clothing. In effect, advertising has cultivated a culture of consumerism, where people are constantly urged to buy, buy, and keep buying.\nMoreover, the impact of advertising extends beyond just consumer behavior. It also affects societal values and norms. Advertisements promote not just products, but also ideals, lifestyles, and even political ideologies. For example, advertisements propagating a certain body image can contribute to the rise of eating disorders or body dysmorphia. Similarly, advertisements portraying gender roles and stereotypes can reinforce harmful gender biases and discrimination. These effects are particularly significant in countries where television or internet access is widespread, and advertising has a pervasive presence in people\u2019s lives.\nIn conclusion, advertising is a powerful force that has a significant impact on our lives, shaping our beliefs, values, and behaviors. While it has undoubtedly contributed to the growth of the global economy, it also has its downsides, such as the promotion of consumerism, the reinforcement of harmful stereotypes, and the cultivation of unrealistic ideals. As consumers, we need to be aware of the impact of advertising and strive to make informed choices that are not solely based on slick sales pitches and empty promises.",

We have become more brand-conscious, and judge people by the products that they possess. Advertising has thus created a certain artificiality, and a societal divide between those who can afford the expensive and \u2018hip\u2019 products, and those who cannot.\nFurthermore, advertising has caused a lot of suffering in the developing world. Multinational corporations have consistently exploited cheap labour and natural resources of some of the poorer nations, thus perpetuating a cycle of poverty. The advertisements spout a feel-good message, but the reality is that companies are putting profits before people, and causing untold harm to communities and the environment.\nIn conclusion, advertising is a powerful force that has had a major impact on the world we live in. While there are some positive aspects, such as the promotion of healthy products or social causes, the negative effects cannot be ignored. As responsible consumers, we must be aware of the impact that advertising has on our lives and make conscious choices based on our values and principles."

The X-men consist of a group of mutants that are feared by their friends and families, who do not understand what they are. Besides fighting crime and villains, the X-men depict characters trying to find acceptance in a world that rejects them.

The books on history, science and technology, current events and philosophy are frequently excerpted in comics. Comics also tend to be easier to understand and their engaging visuals can often capture people\u2019s attention. Hence, by exhibiting comics, people can learn to appreciate the artistry of comics and its contribution to literature. \nIn conclusion, there are indeed many good reasons why comics are important and ought to be exhibited. Comics have the ability to chronicle the different periods of our world, reflect the maturing of human society and possess literary value. As such, if given the opportunity, I would not hesitate to set up an exhibition on comics.",
                "blems to deal with.\nFinally, I would choose to exhibit comics because of the creativity that is involved in the writing and art form.

They combine their sketches and dialogues to form an enthralling story, one that can truly engross the readers. Comics provide a chance for artistic expression and for the reader, they are an excellent source of inspiration and imagination.\nIn conclusion, comics have always been a part of my life, and I believe that they should be exhibited to showcase their importance.

Therefore, an exhibition of comics would be important to reflect these societal changes over the years.\nFinally, comics are important because they offer an escape from reality.

Thus, the comics exhibition would also help to show how the perceptions of individuals about their role in society have evolved over time.\nFinally, comics are significant as they help to develop the imagination and creativity of individuals. The vivid colors, bold lines, and complex designs of comic book creators have inspired many artists to dabble in different mediums of art. Composing an image in a narrative form in comics is a challenge as every panel has a specific function, and there is a need to flow the narrative over from panel to panel. Moreover, comics aim to transport individuals to a different world of fantasy. Comics are also able to bridge language and cultural barriers through their illustrations so that individuals from varying backgrounds can grasp the plot or thesis of the comics. Hence, by exhibiting comics, individuals are also able to understand the visual storytelling techniques used.\nIn conclusion, comics may be dismissed as an insignificant form of illustrated entertainment. Nevertheless, comics are an important reflection of our world, how we have evolved, and how we express our creative minds through the medium of art. Through the comics exhibition, I hope to promote an appreciation of comics and demonstrate how much comics have contributed to our society over the years.",

Younger readers can be entertained and awed by the superheroes\u2019 performances, and may even be stimulated by their energy to express their own creativity in similar ways. Also, as depicted in the movie \u2018Spiderman\u2019, the life of a super-hero can teach youngsters about responsibility in the ultimate \u2018a great power \u2013 great responsibility\u2019 maxim.\nIn conclusion, I believe that a comics exhibition is certainly worthwhile as it reflects the different periods in history, illustrates the diversification of emotions and abilities of superheroes and can inspire creativity among readers.

Comics include many themes that are relatable to people of all ages, such as love, friendship, trust, betrayal, and courage. Through these themes, people can find inspiration and knowledge. Furthermore, comics are a literary form that can help young learners develop their reading habits and garner their interests in literature. Therefore, by setting up a comics exhibition, I hope to pass on the value of comics and nurture the love for reading.",
                "blems to overcome. This is another reason why I would choose to exhibit comics.\nLastly, comics provide a window into the world of creativity. The drawings, colouring and narrative ability that go into the creation of a comic are really extraordinary. The creative process of making a comic is not an easy feat. All the more so if the subject matter and themes are complex. The comic artist must be skilled in drawing, coloring, and innuendo.  The creation of a comic is the summation of an artist\u2019s hard work, talent, and vision. It involves the artist\u2019s creativity and inspirations. Hence, I believe that exhibiting comics is important because it provides viewers insight on the creative process.\nIn conclusion, I would choose an exhibition of comics because I believe that comics are important and exhibit the growth of our society and creativity. They are an exceptional and insightful means of delving into history and human nature, and they have entertained generations of readers."

An employer must exhibit leadership qualities and show himself capable. He should serve as a role model to me and make me want to learn from him.\nI would also want a job that would allow me to apply what I have learnt in my years of education. This is so that what I have learnt would not go to waste but instead, through the job, I would learn how to apply the knowledge accumulated through the years. As the saying goes, \u201cEducation is a lifelong process.\u201d The job should offer courses in upgrading skills, or talks and seminars on how to improve in my job. The job should also be accompanied by overseas assignments so that I would be able to widen my knowledge and to apply my skills in a broader context.\nThe pay, is also another factor that should be considered. The pay should fit the job. That is, the pay should tally with the amount of effort I put into the job.

These people are tired of suffering under bad leadership, and back the terrorists because theirs is a promise of change and improvement. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Jaffna, a north eastern province of Sri Lanka, have killed more than a dozen political and military leaders in the past three years. Ethnic riots in 1983 killed 2000 Tamils, and this pro found sense of Tamil grievance has helped the Tigers retain support. The Tamils feel discriminated against by the Sinhalese \u2013 dominated south, and feel that one of the solutions to ending such ethnic tension is to set up an autonomous state called Tamil Eelam for the Tamils.\nWe tend to view such acts of terror, ruthless murder and total disregard for human life as being revolting and sense less, but the number of pro-terrorist demonstrations in countries like Sri Lanka and in the West Bank and Gaza strip shows us that these terrorists actually enjoy support among their people.\nHowever, terrorist groups run the risk of losing their support. This could happen when the actions they take are seen as being too extreme, or when years of war and privation take their toll. The struggle in Ulster is increasingly viewed with a sense of disgust. Not only would the British government welcome the chance to bring its troops home from North ern Ireland, the majority of the people in Northern Ire land itself, be they Roman Catholic or Protestant, would simply like to get on with their lives. These people have endured 25 years of terrorism and bombings, and some have never known a normal life. Sights of armed soldiers patrolling the area have become common, and even a way of life.\nPublic support for the Irish Republican Army in the United States, mainly due to sympathy for the Irish, has diminished as well, largely due to growing revulsion at their killings. United States government officials say that contributions to the IRA have dwindled to a mere $200 000 a year, compared to millions a few years ago. This goes to show that the image of terrorists being noble \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d can slowly change as years go by, and little or no progress is achieved using strong-arm measures. The heavy cost of providing such groups with arms, and the massive toll on property and human life can cause people to think twice about supporting the terrorists. In Sri Lanka, many of Jaffna\u2019s remaining 600, 000 residents are weary of the war, but are afraid to speak out, aware of the Tiger habit of carrying out \u201clamppostings\u201d, street executions in which the bullet-riddled bodies of dissenters are left with signs labelling them traitors. In such cases, the \u201cfreedom fighters\u201d no longer have great support from the people, who now view them as being ruthless terrorists.\nA terrorist is not a terrorist in the eyes of the people he defends, at least, before his actions take a toll on public support. These people may be motivated by the desire for vengeance or strong religious beliefs to defend the actions of the terrorists as they believe they are fighting for a righteous cause.

The 9/11 attack on the Twin Towers in New York was a heinous act of violence that resulted in the deaths of innocent people. However, the attack also brought global attention to the issue of terrorism, and the United States' role in the Middle East. Similarly, the bombing of the Brighton hotel by the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1984, which aimed to assassinate British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, attracted international media attention to the situation in Northern Ireland.\n\nTerrorism can be distinguished from other forms of violence by the presence of certain characteristics. For an action to be labeled as terrorist, it must be politically motivated and have the intention of causing fear, panic, or terror among the general population. The target of the violence is often symbolic or iconic, such as government buildings, landmarks, or civilians that are representative of a particular group. The act must also be carried out by non-state actors operating outside the boundaries of the law.\n\nDespite the subjective nature of terrorism, the international community has formulated several definitions, with the United Nations being the most recognized. The United Nations describes terrorism as: \u201cany act that is intended to cause death or serious bodily harm to civilians or non-combatants with the purpose of intimidating a population or compelling a government or an international organization to do or abstain from doing any act.\u201d This definition is inclusive and covers a broad range of activities that might be labeled as terrorism.\n\nIn conclusion, the statement \u201cOne man\u2019s terrorist is another man\u2019s freedom fighter\" highlights the complexity of politics and the subjective nature of terrorism. The use of violence for political purposes is often a response to systemic oppression or marginalization. Still, it can also be seen as immoral and unjustifiable. It is therefore essential to distinguish between those who use violence indiscriminately and those whose violence is in response to political injustice. While the statement draws attention to the different perspectives on terrorism, it ultimately emphasizes the need for dialogue and negotiation over violence.",

It is a no-win situation. No matter what is done to help, the action may be seen as an added insult to either party and the possibility of conflict becomes even higher. In Singapore, this is clearly illustrated in the racial riots of the 1950s. Even today, the prejudice and conflicts are still present, though much more subtle. Malays are still stereotyped as lazy, the Chinese, as materialistic beyond redemption and the Indians are still generally looked down upon. I am not saying that the situation is explosive and ripe for conflict but I am just saying that the various prejudices are still present.\nEvidence of racial conflicts is rampant today. For many of these conflicts, their reasons stretch back many decades. For instance, the carnage in Rwanda started when the French colonialists long ago allowed one race, the Tutsis, to rule the other. When the French left, civil war broke out with one race, the Hutus, wanting to avenge the wrongs done to it by the ruling race during the years of French colonialism and to gain power and with the Tutsis trying to keep their power, even at the cost of sacrificing their own people to win sympathy and support. The hotspot in Bosnia can be traced all the way back to the beginning of this century when the breakup of the old Ottoman Empire left many smaller states hungry for more land and power. The \u201cforgotten war\u201d in the Nagorno Karabakh area can be traced to the former USSR\u2019s policy of resettling people away from their native homelands to alleviate its problems with the various nationalities.\nAs can be seen, the roots of these racial conflicts lie deep in history. It would take a long time and a lot of sustained effort to resolve these problems. Meanwhile, the seeds for future racial conflicts would be sown and these would erupt in the future.\nTo conclude, living in a world devoid of racial conflicts does seems to be an impossible dream. It is inherent in man\u2019s nature to want power over others and to be prejudiced against other races or jealous of their progress. This was obvious even at the very dawn of mankind when one tribe would routinely attack another for the simple reason that they were different and there was plunder to be had.

It would take too much time and effort from too many parties, most of which would be reluctant to help unless it was to their direct advantage.

People naturally seek out others of the same race, and so when there is migration, different races tend to keep to themselves, long after any necessity for doing so has passed. With each race segregat ing itself into its own area, misunderstandings and mistrust inevitably arise, sparking off racial conflict.\nIt is not impossible to have racial harmony, but it is unlikely to occur overnight. Racial harmony requires painstaking work and the gradual elimination of racism from the people\u2019s hearts. The government, media, schools, and families all have a responsibil ity in this effort.

We must work towards a better understanding of each other\u2019s cultures, and strive to create a society in which each person is judged not by their race, but by their character.",

The civil rights movement in the United States, led by Martin Luther King Jr., resulted in the end of segregation and improved the opportunities of African-Americans. In South Africa, Nelson Mandela\u2019s leadership helped bring an end to apartheid, and in many other parts of the world, there are laws and policies in place to protect and promote equal opportunities for all races.\n\nIn conclusion, although a world without racial conflicts may remain an improbable dream, progress towards reducing racial tension and promoting equality has been made. With continued effort and education, it is possible that the dream of a world without racial conflicts could become a reality in the future."

In addition, I acquired knowledge of the British political system by perusing Jeffrey Archer\u2019s \u201cFirst Among Equals\u201d and was s exposed to a stark prediction of what would happen to the world if a nuclear war occurred, in John Wyndham\u2019s \u201cChrysalids\u201d. Through a story set during the Revolutionary War, \u201cThe Island of the Blue Dolphins\u201d by Scott O\u2019Dell, I discovered how the American Indians lived their lives in the past.\nFourthly, reading is pleasurable as it helps me to be better able to relate to people. In reading, we are taught to understand the sufferings and problems other people have, which we may never have the opportunity to experience in our real life. For example, Wilfred Owen\u2019s war poems like \u201cDisabled\u201d and \u201cDulce et decorum est\u201d help us to realize the feelings of futility people feel towards the war and the psychological and physical damage done to soldiers in combat. Another example is \u201cGrapes of Wrath\u201d (John Steinbeck), a story set in the 1930s, in America, which revolves around a family from Oklahoma who migrated to California for employment. The story exposes us to poor-paying jobs, great poverty, the need to struggle and fight with others to survive and disdain shown by the rich, towards the poor.\nIn studying any book, we would feel for different characters differently, either sympathising, empathising or having antipathy towards them. This aids us in relating to the people around us as when we read more, our sympathy becomes more easily evoked and thus, in real life, we are also able to feel more easily for others. Extreme, evil characters also assist us in tolerating people who are unpleasant as one compares the latter with the former.   The fifth reason why reading is so pleasurable is be cause reading encourages imagination and creativity. One example is John Wyndham\u2019s \u201cChocky\u201d which urges us to imagine a world where aliens can enter one\u2019s minds to educate us. In this novel, Wyndham provides creative rea sons as to why aliens would want to occupy an earth ling\u2019s brain and refreshing alternatives to conventional ways of doing things.\nUndeniably, not all the books published would give us such pleasures in reading. Some novels have a weak plot, incredible characters and situations and worse of all, are written simply to pander to the baser instincts in mankind: sex and violence. This is notwithstanding the fact that such books do provide readers with some kind of satisfaction, though this is different from the kinds of satisfaction received from reading other kinds of literature. Yet, this kind of pleasure is one which we can do without as it does not benefit us in any other way except for a fleeting moment of delight.   To reiterate, reading does bring tremendous amounts of enjoyment, yet not all the enjoyment elicited from reading may be of the positive kind. The world of books offers endless hours of positive, pleasant and varied amusement to people who can read with ease. Let us strive to get the most out of our readings.",

This, in effect, hakes books bad friends, as a good friend will never try to dominate all of our time and attention.\nPerhaps if more people realize what good friends books can be, they will find that they are not as lonely as they think. After all many things in the books are actually the author\u2019s own experiences and thoughts. We can hear the author\u2019s voice. Even though we are unlikely ever to meet them surely the thought that somebody else in the world could easily be a friend should comfort a lot of lonely people.",

A good book can push someone out of their comfort zone and help them grow as a person, similar to how a friend can help someone face their fears or overcome obstacles.\n\nHowever, some argue that books cannot replace human friendships. They believe that a good friend is someone who can offer emotional support, advice, and human connection. In contrast, a book is an inanimate object that cannot provide human interaction. A book is only a one-way conversation, and while it can offer hope and guidance, it cannot offer a hug or physical comfort. Additionally, friends can be someone to share experiences with, while in contrast, books are a solitary experience. Reading a book can be a solitary activity, and reading multiple books in succession might isolate one from the world if they withdraw too much from society.\n\nHowever, while these arguments have a point, they do not necessarily disprove the statement that a good book is like a good friend. Yes, a book may lack in human connection and interaction, but not everyone is seeking this aspect in a \"friend.\" Furthermore, people read for different reasons. Some read for comfort, support, guidance, or growth, and even though a book might not engage in a conversation nor be physically present, it can still fulfill these needs and provide a sense of kinship.\n\nIn conclusion, like a friend, a good book can offer companionship, therapeutic benefit, inspiration, and motivation. While a book may not replace a human connection, different people have different needs from a \"friend\", and a book can fulfill some of these relationships' aspects.

One can relax on a favourite couch, a drink and titbits by one\u2019s side while leisurely flipping through a book, rereading when one cannot understand the first time. This is not quite possible with a movie that is not on tape. Take our eyes off and, oh no, missed some thing crucial. Life is frantic enough, and books can help us relax. We do not need stress in our leisure too!\nMany books can be just as entertaining as films in their own way. An Omnimax movie may be breathtaking but the beauty of a perfect sunrise in a photography book. leaves a lasting and deeper impression. Jim Carey, Stephen Chow and other comedians may be funny but are often senseless or witless. Many good books give a good laugh with brilliantly witty lines. Also, there is no way anybody can make a film entitled \u201c1001 Greats Jokes\u201d!   We must also know that a book is rarely translated completely to a film. Just take the very successful \u201cFor est Gump\u201d, the film was excellent but deviated quite a bit from the book. Nowhere in the original book did Gump go running cross continent for three years. Often, it takes. the original book to give us a full understanding of the story. No actor can give us as clear a look into the thoughts of the character as the words of the author can.\nDue to the completeness of the original book, it can be more enthralling, more captivating than the film. Sometimes, the loud sounds and bright colours over whelm the scenes so much that all that is meaningful is lost. But a book is quiet; the only sound is our inner reading voice and imagined sounds running with the story. Reading can be an intimate thing between the reader and the story and its character. Characters from many good books I have read still feel so real to me even after reading them a long time ago. Few films can achieve this rapport.\nReading, in addition, cultivates us in ways no films can. It improves our language skills and appreciation of words. I would not be able to write half as well if not for my voracious reading, and many friends feel similarly. Films are loud, forceful and bright. Books can be all that yet gentle and refined. Books make us think too, and use our imaginations.   I love books and reading. They have done more good for me than all the films I have watched and I have watched quite a lot.

Therefore, books have the ability to bring people together in a way that films do not.\n\nIn conclusion, although films have made it easier for people to access entertainment, reading books remains indispensable. The deeper meanings, importance of details and nuances of written words, the mental effort required to understand a book, and the lifelong benefits it offers all outweigh the passive nature of watching a film. The experience of reading a book can never be replaced by a film, and it is important to recognize the unique benefits that each medium offers. The next time someone asks why read when one can watch a film, we should remind them that a book's value cannot be measured merely by its convenience or entertainment value, but rather by the lifelong impact it has on its reader.",

When the power goes out in the middle of movie screening, there are not many alternatives. But a book can continue to be read, even in candlelight. In addition, reading is a more intimate activity in that the text and the reader are alone together, never changing. This intimacy can help to form a relationship between the reader and the story, one that is individual and personal compared to the shared experience of watching a film.\nFurthermore, reading involves the use of our own imagination to create images and characters that we can identify with. This allows us to create our own versions of the characters and settings which can be even more powerful than those portrayed in films. Reading also has the advantage of being able to present more complex and sophisticated ideas, themes, and characters which are often difficult to depict on screen. The reader has the leisure of pausing to consider, check a word or note or preview a certain character. We can take time to reflect and ponder what is said, read and meant. This experience can be about personal growth and enrichment, and cannot be compared to the passive entertainment provided by films.\nIn conclusion, both books and films have their advantages and limitations. While films may be more easily accessible and entertaining, reading requires more time, effort, and concentration but can offer a more intimate and enriching experience. In the end, the choice between reading and watching a film comes down to personal preferences and tastes. As a student, it is essential to appreciate and experience both forms of entertainment and learning to improve our language ability and be a well-rounded individual.",

And unlike films, books do not require one\u2019s full attention, allowing for multi-tasking, such as reading while eating, waiting for food or even doing one\u2019s business in the toilet. Another advantage of books is how they stimulate the reader\u2019s imagination through the use of words, which photographs and visual effects cannot achieve. The reader is given an opportunity to build the character's appearance, personality, and even their environment, which can lead to a more personal and individualistic reading experience. \nIn conclusion, while films may provide accessibility, visual and audio entertainment and social bonding, books have their own unique merits. The ability to read anywhere, the convenience of carrying one around and the personal stimulation it offers are advantages unmatched by films. So, why read when you can watch a film? Perhaps the better question is: why limit oneself to just one form of storytelling when both have their own significant value?",
                "r an appointment. Furthermore, reading books is a great exercise for the brain. Unlike films, which present you with everything, books allow for imagination to take flight. The reader is left to visualise the setting, the characters and their emotions. This stimulates the mind and can lead to greater brain development. Moreover, reading books can also help improve one\u2019s language, grammar and communication skills. It can also expand one\u2019s knowledge on different subjects as there are a range of genres available to readers.\nIn conclusion, while it is tempting to choose films over books due to accessibility, affordability and entertainment value, there are still reasons to argue for the importance of reading books. Reading provides the opportunity for imagination, development of language skills and knowledge expansion. In a world that is constantly consumed by screen time, it is imperative that we continue to encourage reading and appreciate the value of books.",

Books also give an individual the satisfaction of personal accomplishment and the chance to develop his or her imagination skills.\nBooks provide a deeper understanding of the story or topic at hand. While films rely on visual and audio elements, books delve into the emotions, thoughts and motivations of the characters. They also allow an individual's imagination to expand as he or she visualises the scenes and characters in their own unique way. Reading also improves one\u2019s vocabulary as well as language skills. For students, this is especially important as their reading skills affect their academic achievements.\nIn conclusion, films do have their advantages over books in terms of accessibility, entertainment and socialising. However, books provide a more personal and profound experience in terms of intellectual benefits, imagination expansion and language development. Therefore, while films are a convenient entertainment option, books should not be replaced as an important source of knowledge and intellectual growth.",

The same cannot be said of a film which requires at least an hour of uninterrupted attention.\nAdditionally, books allow for personal interpretation and imagination to be exercised. A reader can get lost in the author\u2019s words and create their very own images and worlds in their head. This kind of creativity and imagination cannot be found in films where everything is presented right in front of you in a ready-made package. Reading also helps to improve one's language proficiency, vocabulary and cognitive abilities. The act of reading exercises the brain and this results in better memory, imagination and critical thinking.\nIn conclusion, while films may seem to be the more popular and accessible form of entertainment, books still have many advantages. They are portable, affordable and allow for personal imagination and growth. So why read when you can watch a film? Because reading allows for a unique experience and benefits that cannot be found in a film.",

Rather than being spoon-fed content with ready-made images and sounds, readers must actively engage their imagination as they read. They become co-creators of the story as they envision the characters, settings and events in their minds. Reading also improves vocabulary, enhances creativity and imagination, and helps develop critical thinking and analytical skills. These skills are essential for academic and career success. So while films have their advantages, there are still compelling reasons why we should read books.\nIn conclusion, both films and books have their own strengths and weaknesses. While films provide cheap and easy entertainment with vivid visuals and sounds, books offer a unique and personal reading experience that cannot be easily replaced. It is important to find a balance between the two and appreciate and enjoy both for what they offer.",

In contrast, watching a film requires a relatively fixed period of time as well as the condition of a dark room with none of the awkward, jostling movement lesser mortals impose on us on a morning rush hour train ride.\nFurthermore, while films have limitations on interpretation, books provide ample space for the imagination to roam free. Readers can create intensely vivid pictures of the story in their own head. The suspense of a mystery novel or romantic build-up in a romance novel is entirely of their own making without external help. A film\u2019s images and sounds have been created and presented to us by someone else already. The creativity we experience and hone by puzzling out problem plots or characterisations is often more gratifying than the instant gratification served up by the film.\nIn conclusion, while films are certainly more easily accessible, less effortful to process and shape our own imagination, the written word has value that the filmic image cannot replace. The enjoyment of a story through reading, the thought that the imaginative cross-currents are specific only to the reading individual. together amount to more than the sum of watching visualized images.",

Moreover, reading stimulates the mind in ways that watching a film cannot. It improves vocabulary, memory and cognitive abilities. It is not just a leisure activity but also a tool for intellectual growth.\nIn conclusion, while films may serve as an easier and more entertaining alternative to reading books, both mediums have their own unique benefits and disadvantages. It ultimately depends on the individual\u2019s personal preferences and needs. Hence, it is important to keep an open mind and appreciate the value of both forms of art.",

Try bringing a VCR and television on the plane and the air stewardess may severely reprimand you. \nAnother advantage of books is that they allow the reader to visualize the story and characters in their own individual way. This is where books vary from films. Readers are more involved in the book as they have to use their imagination and fill in the gaps. This is not possible with films as the movie sets the scene, and the viewer has to accept this. Personal interpretations may differ from book to book, and that in itself is the beauty of reading. Such interpretations may not be possible with films.\nIn conclusion, films are an effective and widely distributed means of entertainment with their own advantages. But books still have their own unique advantages that enable them to hold their own in the world of entertainment. It is important to have a balance between both entertainment sources as each has something to offer that the other cannot.

Worse still, films wear out with repeated usage. Books rarely wear out and can be enjoyed many times over long periods of time. Finally, and perhaps more significantly, reading is a unique and stimulating activity that requires active participation of the mind, unlike watching films which is largely a passive activity. Reading encourages one to think critically, to reflect on the author\u2019s intentions, the meanings and implications of the words and phrases used. Moreover, reading challenges our imaginations to wander in directions that may not have occurred to us prior to the reading.\nIn conclusion, films are undeniably a tempting alternative to books. They are cheaper, more accessible, and in many ways more entertaining. But they are not an absolute replacement. The experience of reading is not to be underrated. It offers a unique intimate engagement with the thoughts and ideas of authors. Moreover, it challenges the mind to think critically and to exercise imagination. In other words, we need both books and films: the former for their intellectual engagement, the latter for their entertaining diversion."

I used to write in my diary, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t understand why God has to do this to me\u201d and tearfully pity myself. Then one day when I was sixteen, I started reading my old diary and some thing came to my mind whenever I read those episodes. l realised that there are many people without legs and hands, and all I have is a little crooked leg which functions perfectly. Why was I so ungrateful? From that day, I stopped blaming God and started to take the initiative to walk straight. My mother says I have improved tremendously \u2013 and thanks again to my diary.\nI am confessing a great sin I did once, I read my mother\u2019s diary two years ago\u2026 and believe me, I still feel so guilty about it though nobody knows. But that diary made me love her more than anything else in the whole, wide universe. My father passed away around three years ago and she kept a diary as her means of communication with him. I truly did not know she loved him so much and she was going through such deep sorrow though she put on such a brave face outside \u2013 for us she said. She felt that her only reasons for living now were for me and my sisters and nothing in the world would make her leave us, because of him. From just those few pages that I read, I learned how great a mother\u2019s love is and how much greater it is for her husband. My mother was surprised at the change she saw in me after that I have been a wonderful daughter to her since, though she does not really know why. And when I get married, I want to be like her\u2026 and I owe it to a personal diary book, not mine in this case!

Similarly, writing down one's thoughts, particularly negative ones, is a much healthier way of coping with stress than keeping them inside.

            "prompt": "Is modern technology beneficial or threatening to democracy?",
            "human_gen_truncate": "tation simply by posting baseless accusations. Recently, wealthy youths and young adults in China were flaunting their wealth online and the Chinese were quick to recognize that this had a negative influence on the general public as such activities promote arrogance and wastage. The authorities took swift action and banned numerous social media accounts that they deemed detrimental to Chinese culture. Clearly, the belief that modern technology offers complete freedom is an illusion. Governments maintain full control. Hence, it is clear that modern technology, in reality, has limited impact and does not easily threaten the existing system of governance (be it democracy or others).\nDetractors may argue that some people may make use of the Internet to magnify the flaws of democracy and hence, cause others to lose confidence in democracy. For instance, extremists may take to the Internet to radicalize young and gullible citizens and encourage them to perform acts of terrorism. In this case, one may argue that modern technology threatens democracy because it gives rise to unruly and violent behaviour. In 2015, two adults who radicalized themselves via social media were arrested and detained in Singapore under the Internal Security Act (ISA). The ISA gives the government the power to detain individuals without trial. Although controversial, the ISA has been enforced and proven somewhat effective in weeding out potential threats that arise from the use of modern technology. Hence, confidence levels in democracy remain largely unaffected due to the presence of similar laws.\nDetractors may also use the Internet to point out egregious imperfections directly to dampen confidence in democracy. For instance, one may go online to point out that too much freedom of speech can lead to an unstable political climate. Without stability, a country is less likely to be able to continue attracting foreign investments and hence, livelihoods are at stake. By stoking fear, one may become successful in destabilizing a country. Protests could be rife in public streets. Public confidence in the elected government would plunge to an all-time low and hence, threaten democracy.\nAdmittedly, these concerns are understandable and even legitimate. However, one must not forget that although these are austere concerns, governments are taking an active interest in them. As mentioned, having no regulations at present does not mean that regulations will not come into effect in the near future. With time, governments are realizing that policies and laws need to be updated to deal with problematic concerns. In China, in the name of national security, all foreign social media platforms are banned and citizens are only allowed access to local social media platforms, which are closely monitored and highly regulated by the Chinese government. In New Zealand, the country has recently announced that it will start to regulate social media content to deal with misinformation. Again, this clearly shows that modern technology has little or no impact on a country's system of governance as it can be controlled and regulated if a government chooses to.\nIn conclusion, the rise of modern technology has given everyone additional channels to voice their opinions. In other words, we have more choices than ever. I firmly believe that technology has given democracy a boost. At times, technology may appear to threaten democracy. However, these threats can easily be curbed by incumbent governments and therefore, modern technology poses little threat to democracy.",

Social media sites can be used to spread misinformation and disinformation. People can easily fabricate stories meant to influence the opinions of others in relation to matters that concern the state. In some cases, misinformation campaigns may be coordinated and executed by foreign adversaries as a way to interfere with the democratic process or cause public discord in states. Additionally, efforts to manipulate processes such as elections, also known as cyber-voting, are becoming increasingly commonplace. Technology provides the means to subvert voting systems through assaults such as hacking and creating bot interference, which can render the entire electoral process vulnerable to manipulation. This erodes the free and fair outcome of elections and undermines the legitimacy of democratic processes.\n\nIt is evident that technology presents both opportunities and challenges to the democratic process. For democracy to be strengthened by advancements in technology, it is crucial that all stakeholders such as governments, industry, and civil society, are committed to ensuring that technology is harnessed for positive outcomes. Government leadership and appropriate regulation are crucial. Governments can support transparency by making official information easily accessible and enact laws that promote fair and responsible use of technology, such as regulating social media platforms to reduce the spread of fake news. Industry players should commit to ethical practices and proactively implement mechanisms for user protection and data privacy. Finally, civil society actors, including media and watchdog groups, have to monitor and broadcast reports exposing any inappropriate use of such technology.\n\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that technology is a double-edged sword when it comes to democracy. While modern technology has facilitated greater transparency, citizen participation, and accountability, it has also created new challenges. Progress in democratic governance requires that we harness the positive advances of technology while avoiding the pitfalls and potential risks that could undermine democracy.

This is especially evident during elections, where political parties may try to spread misinformation to discredit their opposition. When this happens, democracy is threatened. In such cases, it is important for the public to remain vigilant and discern credible sources from fake ones. We should use technology in a mature and responsible way, by thoroughly checking information sources before sharing them to ensure that the information we spread helps to advance democracy instead of hindering it.\nAll in all, modern technology is largely beneficial to democracy. The ease of information sharing and communication allows for more voices to be heard and more perspectives to be considered.

This highlights that while modern technology opens up avenues for the expressions of opinions, it will not be akin to shouting from the rooftops as there will always be some form of regulation, otherwise it may become a threat to democracy.\nIn addition, modern technology has enabled citizens to have access to more reliable information than before. With traditional media being controlled by major corporations, the Internet provides a wider range of views and perspectives. This allows voters to make informed decisions based on unbiased and truthful information, a hallmark of democracy. However, modern technology also poses a threat to democracy. It can undermine the sanctity of democratic processes when it is used to spread fake news or deep fakes for political gain. The rise of deep fakes has given cause for concern that what people see or hear on the Internet cannot always be trusted. It is easier to dupe citizens with false news than to convince them to change their beliefs, especially if they have been carefully cultivated over time. Therefore, while the Internet provides a rich source of information, one must use discernment and judgment to distinguish fact from fiction.\nIn conclusion, modern technology has both benefits and threats to democracy. However, the benefits far outweigh the threats if we can regulate the discourse effectively. Through modern technology, we can channel important information quickly and to more people than we could have done in the past. It also offers valuable feedback from constituents, which is valuable to elected representatives. Nonetheless, we must be wary of the danger of using modern technology to deceive and manipulate citizens. To ensure the integrity of democracy, governments should work toward building a democratic framework to regulate and protect against the abuse of modern technology.",

Hence, while modern technology can benefit democracy, it can also pose a threat when it is used for negative purposes.\nAnother threat to democracy arises as social media becomes an increasingly large source of information to the general public. Not all information shared on social media platforms is truthful and accurate. There have been cases of fake news surfacing during elections. These fake news can have serious repercussions, altering the public's view on a particular political party or individual. As a result, such news could sway votes unfairly. Such threats to democracy were most recently observed in the United States during the 2016 Presidential Elections, where a variety of cyberattacks had taken place, aimed at damaging one party's reputation via fake news. These attacks were orchestrated by foreign parties. Hence, with false information being spread, democracy suffers as the general public would not be well-informed.\nIn conclusion, while modern technology has its benefits and threats to democracy, the benefits outweigh the threats. Since democracy is greatly improved when citizens are highly engaged in the decision-making process, modern technology is a helpful tool in democratic systems. It facilitates discussions and makes voicing of opinions more possible and convenient. However, modern technology also poses risks in the form of the spread of fake news but this can minimized with the creation of policies and laws that regulate content on the Internet. From my perspective, we should have confidence in technology and use it to our advantage. By doing so, democracy can be enhanced and strengthened.",

While some people may argue that POFMA is a tool to suppress opposing voices, it is ultimately a tool to deter people from spreading false information.\nThere are, of course, potential threats to democracy that are associated with modern technology. For example, it has been observed that cyber warfare and hacking are becoming more commonplace. Hackers have been known to interfere in electoral processes by manipulating ballots and/or spreading fake stories via social media. Such activities can have significant implications on the integrity of the election result, which then threatens the legitimacy of the subsequent government. These threats are real and need to be addressed in an efficient and effective manner.\nIn conclusion, modern technology is highly beneficial to democracy.

The brevity of social media also ensures that complex information is broken down into comprehensible pieces, thus making it easy for the masses to understand the decisions made by their leaders. With this greater transparency, voters can hold leaders accountable and make more informed political decisions. Through such transparency, voters can also judge the government's commitment to tackling problems such as inequality and climate change \u2013 issues typically considered to be a threat to democracy.\nTo conclude, modern technology is both beneficial and threatening to democracy, depending on the manner in which it is used.

A study by researchers from Oxford University found evidence of organized social media manipulation campaigns in around 48 countries. The study also revealed that during elections, these campaigns were used to influence public opinion by spreading fake news or divisive content. This proves that while modern technology encourages freedom of expression, it also leaves room for misuse and abuse. Nonetheless, we cannot entirely blame technology itself for the proliferation of fake news. It is ultimately up to the users to decide what information to believe and what to disregard. It is our responsibility to be discerning and critical in our sources of information.\nIn conclusion, while modern technology presents both benefits and threats to democracy, the impact it has on the latter can be generally positive if used responsibly. It is up to each individual to discern what is reliable information and to be more conscious in their social media usage.

The spread of rumours and conspiracy theories on social media platforms, intentionally misleading information, and the deliberate manipulation of public opinion through targeted advertising have created a new era of fake news. The proliferation of fake news undermines citizens' trust in the democratic process and damages the legitimacy of democratic institutions. Additionally, technology has also been used to limit democracy by infringing on individuals' privacy. Governments have used technology to spy on citizens, track their movements, monitor their communications, and access their personal data. Such actions, if left unchecked, can make it more challenging for citizens to engage in candid discussions and criticisms of their government.\n\nIn conclusion, modern technology has had both positive and negative effects on democracy.

The use of algorithms to distribute content has led to filter bubbles, creating echo chambers where users only see content that confirms their biases and beliefs. This can foster a climate of intolerance towards other views, leading to a breakdown in civil discourse.\n\nIn conclusion, modern technology has both benefitted and threatened democracy. While technology has enhanced the transparency and participation of citizens in the democratic process, it has also challenged democracy by spreading disinformation and polarisation. It is essential for governments, social media platforms, and individuals to be vigilant in guarding against the spread of falsehoods while using technology to promote open and transparent governance. With the tremendous potential of technology, it is crucial to ensure that it serves to strengthen democracy rather than eroding it.",

Instead of resisting, industry leaders took it upon themselves to come up with alternative solutions. In addition, the Montreal Protocol also provides clear incentives to all participants. Those who join the treaty gain market share as they are included in trade agreements. While the Paris Agreement mimics the Montreal Protocol, I have yet to see compelling evidence of countries taking up full responsibility for carbon emissions in a convincing manner. For instance, while the United States publicly declares that it aims to attain Net Zero emission status by the year 2050, the prime minister of India announces that India aims to attain the same goal only by year 2070. I shudder to think about the state of this planet if temperature continues to rise till 2070! Obviously, different countries are marching to their own drum beats and a consensus has not been reached.\nWhile we rely heavily on our leaders to bring about dramatic change to the climate, there is also increasing evidence that there is heightened awareness of global warming amid the population. Stakeholders such as celebrities who are not usually involved in climate change are starting to speak up. An evident example would be Mr. Arnold, a prominent international film star who starred in numerous Hollywood action movies. In his recent speeches, he was visibly angered by how little politicians have achieved during the past decade and he wanted to encourage people to take action and not rely fully on political leaders to effect climate change. Young activists such as Greta Thunberg are also becoming more and more outspoken and have taken to the media to voice their opinions courageously.\nI am also of the view that more can be done to speed up the progress of climate change. Firstly, countries will need to commit to active monitoring to track their progress. A quick visit to government websites reveals that many countries such as Hong Kong, Switzerland, New Zealand have taken steps to educate their citizens about environmental concerns. They have also set aside funds that either encourage companies to go green or take up green projects that are beneficial to the environment in the long run. A clear standard will need to be set and observed by all countries to minimize false or inaccurate reporting of carbon emissions. Instead of waiting for governments to put regulations in place, private companies should act swiftly to conduct studies that help improve efficiency and reduce wastage. Finally, governments should work towards creating new jobs so as to minimize job losses and disruptions.\nIn conclusion, the message to everyone has never been clearer. We cannot achieve lofty climate change goals alone. We need to take ownership of the problems that we have created, perhaps due to excessive consumption, and assume full responsibility. While I observe that that has not happened presently, I refuse to accept that all our attempts to revert global warming are destined to fail. As shown by the success of the Montreal Protocol, it is clearly possible that as a race, we are perfectly capable of directing our futures and changing our fortunes. While some tacky challenges remained, I adopt the sanguine view that in time, some of our attempts will succeed. A successful attempt can inspire future generations and pave the way for future successes. My only hope is that success comes soon enough before we cross the line of no return and it is too late.",

For instance, the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015 was a significant achievement in the global fight against climate change. However,  although 191 countries agreed to the accord, it remains to be seen whether they will find it feasible to fulfill their pledges. The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted many economies, and most countries are prioritizing economic recovery over climate initiatives. Moreover, the political will to implement the accord varies significantly between countries with diverse political climates.\n\nHowever, there are also counterarguments to the view that all attempts to mitigate climate change are inherently ineffective. First, significant progress has been made in developing renewable energy technologies. Solar and wind energy are becoming increasingly popular due to falling prices and advancements in technology. Similarly, electric cars are becoming an increasingly attractive alternative to fossil-fueled vehicles. These developments suggest that alternatives to existing technologies may well emerge in the future, paving the way for greater emissions reductions.\n\nSecond, the shift to low-carbon energy alternatives is also being driven by market forces. Coal-fired power plants have been closing at a rapid rate as renewable energy sources become cheaper. Large corporations are also investing in renewable energy, driven by both moral and economic considerations. In the past, energy-intensive industries like aviation, shipping, and steel production have been slow to adopt eco-friendly technologies. Still, there are now signs that they are beginning to explore alternatives actively.\n\nFinally, public awareness and action on climate change are increasingly gaining momentum, with thousands of movements and citizen groups emerging globally. This collective activism could lead governments and corporations to take more significant measures to reduce emissions, encourage a transition to a low carbon economy, and enact policies to achieve net-zero emissions in the future.\n\nIn conclusion, the view that attempts to control climate change are entirely ineffective is not entirely accurate. While existing mitigation strategies face several challenges and limitations, there are signs that opportunities to combat climate change continue to emerge. Technological advancements, market forces, and ongoing activism by groups worldwide suggest that the fight against climate change can still be won. However, concerted collaboration between nations worldwide, with a shared focus on a sustainable future, remains key to this effort's success.",

In addition, businesses were also given the opportunity to establish themselves as leaders in the alternative refrigerants market, which provided them with an edge in the global market. As such, the Montreal Protocol proved to be effective in mitigating the damage to the Ozone Layer.\nTo conclude, while regional climate treaties have not yielded significant results in controlling climate change so far, I am of the view that it is still possible to enact effective change through a combination of economic incentives and technology sharing. In order for countries to truly commit to such efforts, it is important to address concerns regarding economic impact and provide concrete incentives for positive change.",

This provides hope that with the right incentives and support, nations can reduce their carbon emissions and address climate change effectively.\nIn conclusion, while many regional climate change treaties have failed in the past, it is important to recognize that progress is being made. The Paris Climate Agreement marks a significant step forward in bringing all nations together to address climate change. While there are still challenges to be overcome, the success of the Montreal Protocol shows that industries can and will adapt if given time and resources. Whether attempts to control climate change will ultimately prove effective remains to be seen, but it is my belief that with sustained efforts and global collaboration, we can still make a difference.",

It provided a clear timeline for countries to decrease usage of CFCs, with the actual ban coming into effect after a number of years. This gave industries time to prepare and adapt. Developed nations also provided financial aid to developing nations to help with this transition, which motivated them to comply. The successful implementation of the Montreal Protocol showed that with proper planning, preparation, and support, it is possible to tackle environmental challenges.\n\nIn conclusion, I believe that attempts to control climate change can be effective, but it requires proper planning, coordination, and support from all parties involved. The failures of past regional treaties do not mean that all attempts to mitigate the effects of climate change will fail. The Montreal Protocol is an excellent example of a successful treaty, and we can learn from its success to tackle climate change. Perhaps, we can start by setting clearer timelines and targets, providing more incentives for compliance, and increasing funding for developing countries to aid their transition towards a carbon-neutral future. With these measures, we can begin to tackle climate change effectively and provide a brighter future for generations to come.",
                "difference lies in the fact that the global community was united in their purpose to protect the Ozone Layer. There was a clear and present danger to the environment which required immediate action. Hence, there was little debate or resistance when the treaty was introduced. The economy was not affected as alternative products were introduced to replace CFCs.\nIn conclusion, controlling climate change may seem like an insurmountable task at present. However, I am of the belief that steps can be taken to mitigate the effects of climate change. We need to recognize that it is not just up to the governments to control climate change, but also for individuals to play their part. It could be as simple as recycling or using public transport. Additionally, the world needs to unite and tackle climate change head on. The Paris Climate Agreement is a good start as we now have global backing and participation. The world needs to make the tough decisions, fight off resistance and look beyond the short-term economic consequences in order to save our planet.",
                "crucial difference is because the vast majority of the affected industries were based in developed countries. This meant that developed countries were able to easily enforce the treaty and ensure its success. However, in the case of climate change, the industries that contribute the most to carbon emissions are often found in developing countries. As such, it is much harder to enforce a treaty that requires these countries to cut emissions without causing potentially devastating economic consequences in these areas.\nIn conclusion, my view on the effectiveness of attempts to control climate change is that it is currently ineffective but not impossible. While regional treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Climate Agreement have had their challenges and limitations, it is still necessary for the international community to continue finding ways to combat climate change. It is important to learn from past mistakes, such as the challenges faced in regional treaties, and to find solutions that can effectively curb carbon emissions while also taking into account the economic realities and concerns of participating countries. Ultimately, collective action is crucial in effectively addressing climate change.",
                "answer lies in a combination of good policies, an effective communication strategy and leadership by governments. The Montreal Protocol's policy involves a complete prohibition on the use of CFC and other ozone-depleting substances. With a clear goal and policy in place, industries were incentivized to innovate and switch to other alternatives such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Furthermore, extensive communication to the public was conducted to inform them of the negative consequences of using CFCs. Governments and businesses played a major leadership role in setting a good example by making the switch to HFCs, leading by example and building the momentum for other businesses to follow suit. It is only when you have strong leadership, good policies and effective communication that the public will follow.\nIn conclusion, there are valid reasons to believe that attempts to control climate change can never be truly effective. The failure of the Kyoto Protocol and the limited success of the Paris Climate Agreement have shown that regional treaties may not be sufficient in tackling climate change. However, using the case study of the Montreal Protocol, it is possible for us to see that with good policies, effective communication and strong leadership by governments, it is possible to change industries and countries to change their behavior. While change may be tough and may not occur overnight, we need to focus on making incremental change and spreading awareness to tackle climate change.",
                "answer lies in the fact that the Montreal Protocol did not require any change in the consumer behaviour nor did it require a shift in the economic paradigm. Instead, the focus was on adopting new technologies and developing alternate refrigerants. Hence, the industries were still able to operate and earn while the environment was protected. Perhaps this is one example that could provide policymakers with some insight into the importance of finding solutions that do not pose a threat to our economy but meet our environmental goals.\nIn conclusion, while it may be true that attempts to control climate change are presently ineffective, I do not think that it is entirely true that climate change cannot be controlled. It is important for countries to work collaboratively and not view their respective climate change efforts as a zero-sum game. Rather than relying on regional treaties that may or may not work, I believe that countries need to work together to develop new technologies and innovations. Incorporating climate change solutions into existing sectors of the economy, such as transportation or housing, can also help ease some of the transitioning pain. It is time for us to take action and re-evaluate our lifestyles and what we can do to reduce our carbon footprints in order to contribute to a greener and more sustainable future.",

In the case of the Montreal Protocol, there was a strong sense of urgency to act since the damage could lead to a catastrophic outcome. All countries recognized the necessity of collective efforts to resolve the issue. This collective urgency led to swift action, and many industries willingly shifted to alternative options voluntarily. This example proves that climate change can be controlled with concerted efforts by all parties involved.\n\nTo conclude, I believe that the view that attempts to control climate change can never be truly effective is not entirely true. The success of the Montreal Protocol serves as proof that efforts to protect the environment can indeed be effective. However, it is vital that all parties involved recognize the gravity of the issue and work together to tackle climate change collectively. Regional treaties such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Climate Agreement may not be entirely effective without a united and committed front. We cannot afford to be complacent about climate change because our planet is at stake, and it is our responsibility to act urgently.",
                "difference lies in the level of collaboration and commitment put forth by the participating parties. The Montreal Agreement required a unified effort from all nations who use CFCs, while the Kyoto Protocol placed the responsibility largely on developed nations. Additionally, the cost of switching to alternative refrigerants was not as high compared to the cost of transitioning to renewable energy. The benefits of switching to alternatives were also more tangible, as it directly impacted human health. Hence, countries were more willing to cooperate and take action.\nUltimately, I believe that controlling climate change is an achievable goal. However, it requires a massive overhaul of our current industrial infrastructure and a significant shift in the way we live our lives. It will be incredibly difficult, but not impossible. Global awareness of the issue has been increasing over the years, which provides hope. Countries need to cooperate and work together towards a shared goal. Technological advancements will also be necessary to enable more efficient and cost-effective methods of achieving green targets. Most importantly, action needs to be taken now, rather than waiting for the effects of climate change to become even more dire. The future of our planet is at stake, and we owe it to ourselves and future generations to take the necessary steps.",

The Montreal Protocol was a success because of its clear objectives and tangible timelines.\n\nIn conclusion, I acknowledge that climate change is a complex issue that poses a serious threat to the planet. Despite the challenges that come with regional treaties, I still believe that attempts to control climate change can be effective if they are designed with clear objectives, timelines, and proper incentives and penalties. Climate change is not a problem that can be solved overnight, but with sustained efforts from all nations, a positive difference can be made."

Talent is meaningless without having opportunities for such talents to develop and blossom. Nations as well as private institutions that recognize sports talents do provide the resources and infrastructure to ensure a country's dominance in certain sports. A salient example would be China selecting young children to join Wu Shu training from a very young age. Young children are selected based on their physical attributes and their potential to do well in the sport. Once chosen, the children go through intensive and vigorous training to become world class athletes. Jet Li, an international celebrity, was a beneficiary of this system. He won over a dozen gold medals in Wu Shu before retiring and becoming an action star. Similarly, in many European nations such as Brazil, Spain, Mexico and Argentina, young talented players go for auditions at local youth clubs. Those who are selected are offered contracts. If they do well, they will be offered more lucrative contracts and go on to become professional players. Having these systems in place ensure that talented players get a chance to join and excel in sports, which is beneficial to both individuals and nations.\nIt does sometimes appear that governments only play a minor role in sporting success but I disagree. In many developed nations, specialized sports institutions are set up to nurture the talents of those who are gifted in sports. In Singapore, the Singapore Sports School is well equipped with cutting edge knowledge and equipment to aid and support aspiring sports individuals to pursue their interests. The advantages that the Sports School offers are apparent and lead to tangible results. In fact, it has become a point of contention. Some parents wonder if it is rational to include the Sports School in national sports competitions since they have the tendency to win by large margins in almost all sports! Although contentious, the presence of the Singapore Sports School provides irrefutable evidence that governments play some part in sporting success. Governments are also known to offer attractive monetary incentives to athletes who win medals and enhance national pride.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that we should not define 'nation' so narrowly as to only include the governments. A nation consists of all its people in its entirety \u2013 its leaders, the public and private institutions, as well as private citizens. With this broad definition, I am more inclined to believe both individuals and nations play major roles in achieving sporting success. The individual contributes by giving his or her full dedication and even go as far as to deplete personal savings. Private institutions can help to develop young talents by setting up youth clubs and providing coaching expertise since they have a vested interest in keeping the sports industry healthy. Governments can assist by investing in infrastructure (e.g. building stadiums) and provide financial support or incentives to encourage better performances. For these reasons, I am hesitant to conclude that individuals achieve sporting success and not nations. Both nations and individuals play considerable roles that contribute to sporting successes. Both should work closely together to achieve the best results. Individuals should show their full commitment and nations should back individuals with adequate resources and infrastructure.

While Jordan certainly helped to bring glory to the United States with his performances on the international stage, it is his individual skills, work ethic, and determination that have made him so successful. \n\nIn conclusion, while national pride and team spirit are important factors in sport, it is ultimately individuals who achieve sporting success. It is individual athletes who must perform to the best of their abilities, undergo extensive training and preparation, and possess the motivation and drive to succeed. While national teams may provide a sense of identity and unity, it is the individual skills, talent, and dedication of each athlete that make the difference between victory and defeat. Therefore, the notion that nations achieve sporting success is a fallacy, and it is individuals who should be celebrated for their hard work and achievements.",

Without infrastructure and funding, individuals would not be able to train and compete at the highest levels.

NSAs also need to plan for and oversee the training and resources required for the athletes to peak during the competition season.

The success of the China Olympic team is a classic case of government support. In preparation for the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the Chinese government invested millions of dollars into sports development and talent selection. The investment paid off as China won the most gold medals in their country's history.\nConclusively, sporting success is a complex phenomenon that involves a multitude of variables. While individuals play a massive role in achieving success, nations also play their part. It is fair to say that both factors are equally important, and both are mutually reinforcing.

            "human_gen_truncate": "ing advancement and improvement to perceived forgotten lands, can be found littered in the annals of history, thwarted by the savage, ungrateful creates unable to comprehend the gifts of modernity. From the futile attempts to educate women on menstrual hygiene, or merely seeking to eradicate the abhorrent practice of Chhaupadi \u2013 banishing women to secluded huts during their menstrual cycle \u2013 our efforts to solve problems and eliminate conflict are clearly thwarted by our lack of true understanding. Whether conflict stems from gender, cultural practices, race, religion, or whichever arbitrary division prevalent, intervention on the basis of wisdom, knowledge, or wealth, does little to resolve conflict, even if it might numb the extent somewhat.\nWhat perhaps is the straw that breaks the camel's back is the pride involved in conflict resolution. This is particularly troubling since one country's problem can be construed as injurious to the image of the nation. To then have another nation coming to the rescue is likely to be far more than any self-respecting citizen can bear. After all, nationalistic pride would prevent one from accepting the superiority of another nation and its ways, especially at the implied rejection of one's own, or at least the acknowledgement of its inadequacies. From Castro's rebellious declaration that Cuba does not need \"gifts from the Empire\", to North Korea's persistent efforts to credit the Supreme Leader for the items sent by America, the insecurity and threat to sovereignty is plainly evident. Even in the face of rational reason, the acceptance of assistance from other nations is an admission of weakness and ineptitude. Moreover, this is assuming that the help was not already mired in a Gordian knot of terms and conditions, intended to impose the values and will of the party offering help. The European Union's offer to bail out bankrupt nations often included a requirement for austerity measures, at once a clear show of dominance and also a less than covert criticism on existing leadership. Such efforts, rationally sensible, provoke resentment and retaliation, further fracturing the communities already having difficulties.\nWith such clear limitations to intervention, it is logical for nations to be given the space to work through their issues. They have the clearest insight and knowledge; and whether they admit and acknowledge it is another matter.  The solutions, however juvenile or imperfect the rest of the world deems, is theirs and they can focus on tweaking it instead of being compelled to fervently defend it out of pride. Perhaps most poignant is the revelation that problems and conflicts are largely products of perception. The value-judgement and priorities already vary enough from individual to individual, without foreign input to complicate matters far more.\nNow, it is not to say that foreign intervention has no place, but that the conditions must be thus urgent and severe enough to necessitate the actions, considering the implications and general futility. Thankfully, our pride does allow for the acceptance of help and intervention, at least when it is apparent that the refusal of which mean certain death and suffering in the immediate future. Typically triggered by natural catastrophes, the urgency and severity facilitate the expression and acceptance of humanity, without fear of the cynical self-interest that attaches itself to rational thought and plans. Wherever the catastrophe, the world rallies quickly, driven by the stark reminder of our own mortality, to help a fellow human being. We are cognisant that without assistance, irrevocable consequences are swift and cruel, spurring us to act as a collective bastion of humanity. Yet, in less urgent situations, we find ways to rationalise our way out of helping or accepting such help, however severe it may be.In all, it is clear that countries experiencing conflict should generally be left to sort out its own problems, with its expertise and the futility of intervention, though it must be acknowledged that we should make an exception in cases of extreme urgency and severity. Whether the decision to not intervene is borne of acknowledgement of futility or trust in the community, this approach will at least reduce complications and divergence that lend itself to further disagreements. It takes a lot of faith to allow events to unfold themselves, the effort to resist intervention far greater than simply taking over. Let us not make the mistake of equating non-intervention with disinterest, but instead, choose to see it as the greatest expression of faith and confidence in the fellow humans in other nations. As much as we lambast Nigeria and their president, we should remember that the people had the wisdom to not re-elect President Goodluck. That should count for something.",

The conflict in Syria illustrates that foreign intervention can complicate the situation, prolong the conflict, and contribute to the suffering of innocent people.\n\nAnother example of a negative intervention stems from the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, an event that was based on false intelligence and led to a prolonged and destructive conflict that destabilized the region and cost thousands of lives. Critics argue that the invasion was a misguided attempt to impose Western values on Iraq, rather than allowing the nation to determine its own destiny.\n\nFurthermore, foreign intervention could lead to issues relating to sovereignty, and independence. For example, in 1998, the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) indicted Slobodan Milosevic, the former President of Serbia and Kosovo, for war crimes. The ICTY defeated the Serbian government's claims that the case was illegitimate since the ICTY was established by the United Nations Security Council\u2019s resolution. The situation in Serbia illustrates that foreign intervention may be perceived negatively by a country's citizens and governments.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue of whether countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out their own problems is a complex one. Any decision to intervene or not should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the nature, extent, and causes of the conflict. Sometimes, external intervention is necessary when a conflict poses a global threat or gross human rights abuses. Conversely, sometimes intervention can cause more harm than good and lead to prolonged conflict.

By assuming that we know best or imposing our solutions on others, we are potentially causing more harm than good.\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly cases where external intervention is necessary, I am of the opinion that countries experiencing conflict should be generally left to sort out their own problems. The motivations of external actors are often questionable and seldom purely altruistic, and the complexities of different societies and cultures make simplistic approaches ineffective and potentially harmful. Rather than imposing our solutions on others, we should respect the autonomy of different societies, and work towards building constructive relationships that facilitate peaceful resolution of conflicts.",

This further confirms the conviction that intervention should be avoided; the acknowledgement that we lack adequate understanding and appreciation for the issues afflicting troubled states gives credence to this position.\nIn conclusion, while it is tempting to jump at the notion of external intervention for countries experiencing conflict, there are more downsides to it than there are upsides. The vested interest of foreign countries can hamper the ability of the state to actually solve its underlying issues, while interventionists, seemingly benevolent and altruistic, are in fact prone to impose their own biases and misconceptions on the issues they are trying to fix.

It is perhaps better to give countries the chance to develop their own unique solutions to their problems, ones that are sustainable in the long-term and considerate of their own history, culture, and traditions. It is only when they ask for help, or when the conflict threatens to spill beyond their borders, that external assistance becomes viable. Even then, the assistance must come with a certain level of humility and respect for the indigenous people and their way of life.\n\nIn conclusion, while the argument that countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out its own problems has its drawbacks, I do believe that intervention should be minimized. External assistance may seem like a noble enterprise, but it often carries with it ulterior motives and a distorted perspective. Conflict resolution is a complex and intricate process, and local solutions may prove to be more effective and sustainable in the long-term.",

Rather, it is often an exercise in futility, driven by implausible vested interests, the narrow lens of perception, and the cultural incomprehension. We should seek to support these countries by all means necessary, but not impose solutions that will cause more harm than good.

It is far more beneficial to let countries sort out their issues in their own unique ways and at their own pace, rather than imposing solutions that only seem to work on paper.\nIn conclusion, I agree that countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out their own problems. While the moral imperative of intervention cannot be underestimated, the reality is often far from ideal, with vested interests often taking priority over fairness and common good. Moreover, the uniqueness of each country's problems makes it impossible for outsider perspectives to be relevant to the solution. Therefore, we must allow countries to manage their conflicts, while offering support where we can and if they ask for it. Only then can we expect meaningful, long-term solutions to emerge.",

Intervention carries a danger of vested interests and of imposing methods that might not be effective, and risks worsening the existing problem and wasting resources. Admittedly, such a course of action is not without its own challenges, and it would require a careful consideration of how best to offer support to these countries in crisis, without undermining their sovereignty or imposing values that they may not agree with. Nonetheless, it remains the more pragmatic approach to the oftentimes complex and nuanced issue of countries in conflict.",

The interest of the external forces, coupled with the inability to fully understand the intricacies of the problem being faced, often undermine any good that could be done. Efforts to assist should only be rendered with the true intention of improving the situation in a way that is respectful to the context and ways of the affected societies. Countries experiencing conflict should generally be left to sort out their own problems, but with a willingness on the part of external powers to assist or advise where needed.",

Besides, in sorting out their own problems, the citizens are forced to grapple with the complexities, becoming personally invested in the resolution that is more likely to be enduring. Their nuance understanding of the issue aside, the resistance to internal interventions is also significantly less, unlike external attempts that ignite larger problems, sometimes more severe than what was initially there.\nIn conclusion, while there is a compelling logic for external intervention in conflict-laden countries, I believe that countries experiencing conflict should be left to sort out their own problems. Both the vested interest and our limited understanding make external interventions impractical and potentially even damaging. Rather than assuming the superior know-how of external bodies, we should recognize and support the potential for internal solutions. While these resolutions may take longer to institute, they are likely to be more sustainable, as the very people that the interventions aim to assist will have a personal investment in the success of those resolutions.",

At best, it could only treat the symptoms but not address the root problems, leading to a flawed and unsustainable solution.\nIn conclusion, I believe that countries experiencing conflicts should be left to sort out their own problems to the best of their ability. However, it does not mean that the international community should abandon them. Instead, foreign involvement should only offer support in a non-intrusive manner and with the understanding that they cannot solve all problems. The long-term solution should be driven by the country itself and not by the interests of external powers. Only then can true independence and resilience be fostered, and a lasting peace be achieved.",
                "ing solutions we think are appropriate, might easily ignore the nuances and intricacies of the problem, resulting in further complications and conflicts. This is evident in the American intervention in Vietnam, where the war claimed 3.8 million lives, and countless more in Afghanistan and Iraq after 9/11. These interventions in conflicts that bore no imminent threat to the US themselves testify to the dangers of ill-informed intervention or lack of long-term planning. Therefore, to argue that foreign intervention is the best solution to a conflict in another nation, is challenging given the unique context of each individual nation.\nIn conclusion, while there may be some cases that warrant external intervention, I believe that countries experiencing conflict should generally be left to sort out their own problems. The vested interest of such interventions, the challenges of applying our own perspectives to assess other people's conflict, as well as the possibility of inadvertently exacerbating the situation may make it more prudent to leave the situation alone. Nations should be allowed to manage their problems autonomously, with external help offered in the form of non-interventionist support systems where needed. Ultimately, this approach will encourage responsibility and self-governance, leading to more sustainable solutions to conflict and problems within a country."

            "human_gen_truncate": " incorporate it as part of the government's arsenal, hence proving a nation's well-being is dependent on economic development.\nAnother reason for this dependence is the fact that economic development is often taken as an indicator of a capable government, a trait that is needed for the nation to have a voice on international platforms. As the Chancellor of Germany, a nation with laudable economic health and system, it is little wonder that Angela Merkel is the second most powerful person in the world. This same quality has allowed Singapore, a tiny island-nation, to have a loud voice on international matters. Evidently, sound economic policies and sustained development are essential in the reputation of nations and their leaders. The same clout then enables the nation's welfare to be protected, without being subject to the generosity of those in power. Greece's financial crisis rendered them vulnerable and at the mercy of Germany. While Greece sought a bailout, they were compelled to undergo the crippling experience of a complete breakdown of the system and entertain the possibility of austerity measures as condition for future assistance from its wealthier European counterparts. This makes it abundantly clear that economic development is needed to ensure a nation's well-being.\nThat said, there is something absolutely noble about turning one's back on economic matters and focussing on the intangibles instead. Beyond mere economic pursuit, once that has been achieved, the nation's well-being would divorce from the material pursuits. This is when the Nordic countries seem to shine the way. Not known for rapid economic development nor productivity in the way that Asia has set the bar, countries like Norway, Finland, and Denmark illuminate the way forward for national welfare. Finland has on of the best education systems in the world, a trait that would have been exploited by innumerable other nations to boost economic growth, yet Finland channels its best people into education for long-term betterment. Not materially, but intangibly. Norway's expenditure on criminals, even recalcitrant ones like Anders Breivik, could have gone a long way in boosting productivity or development, but Norway believes in being human and humane. These examples show that while a nation's well-being is typically dependent on economic development, it may not be so for nations which have attained enough to meet its needs. For these privileged nations, their well-being then veers away from the pursuit of economic development, on to other areas that are often intangible, and with it, something to be truly proud of.\nAll in all, it is apparent that a nation's well-being is largely dependent on economic development, whether past or present. The issue is not then the mandate to push for even more economic development, but to realise it is just a means to the end. True well-being is the freedom for governments to do what is best of the nation and people, without needing to fear that they will be ousted for it.",

For example, Singapore's development has led to the improvement of healthcare facilities, making healthcare services more accessible and affordable to citizens. Additionally, the country has invested heavily in its infrastructure, improving transportation and connectivity. This has made it easier for people to travel and access goods and services.\n\nHowever, the claim that a country's well-being is only dependent on its economic development is not entirely true. Economic development can sometimes lead to negative effects on the environment and social well-being of the population. For example, the economic development of some countries has led to deforestation, pollution, and environmental degradation. This can have negative effects on human health and well-being. Additionally, economic development can lead to income inequality. This is because some people may benefit more than others from the economic development, leading to an unequal distribution of wealth and opportunities. Income inequality can lead to social unrest and create a sense of dissatisfaction among the population.\n\nFurthermore, economic development can lead to a heavy dependence on a few industries. This can lead to instability when the industries experience a downturn. For example, many countries in the Middle East are heavily dependent on the oil industry. This has led to economic instability when there is a drop in global oil prices. Therefore, the reliance on one industry can have detrimental effects on the economy and the well-being of the population.\n\nIn conclusion, a country's well-being can be influenced by its economic development. Economic development can lead to improvement in job opportunities, higher income levels, and the improvement of infrastructure and healthcare facilities. However, the claim that a country's well-being is solely dependent on its economic development is not true. Economic development can lead to environmental degradation, income inequality, and a heavy dependence on a few industries.

A notable example of this would be the United States, where its economy is one of the largest in the world, yet it still struggles with issues such as income inequality, healthcare access, and racial discrimination. Therefore, it is crucial to strike a balance between economic development and social development to ensure the overall well-being of a nation. Governments need to implement policies that cater to both material and non-material needs, such as education, healthcare, and social protection, to provide a safety net for their citizens and allow them to lead fulfilling lives.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is safe to assume that economic development plays a significant role in a nation's well-being, it cannot be the sole focus. The well-being of a nation cannot be measured solely on economic indicators, but rather on a comprehensive assessment of both tangible and intangible factors. A sustainable future requires a balance between economic development and social development, ensuring that the needs of all citizens are met and the nation thrives as a whole.",

It has been marked as a \"fine city\" with little civil liberties and a lowered focus on freedom of expression and creativity because of its strong economic focus. Thus, while economic development is important, it certainly does not guarantee the well-being of a nation if other factors like social cohesion and political stability remain unaddressed. In fact, sustained economic development may inadvertently lead to environmental and social degradation if not managed well. As such, the notion that economic development is sufficient to guarantee a nation's well-being needs to be challenged.\n\nIn conclusion, while economic development certainly plays a major role in ensuring the well-being of a nation, relying solely on it to secure a nation is a myopic view of the multi-faceted nature of well-being. It is important to acknowledge the value of other factors like social justice, environmental sustainability and political stability in ensuring the long-term prosperity of a nation.",
                "recognize that it is one of the many factors that influence a nation's welfare.\nThat being said, there are cases where the relationship between economic development and a country's well-being is not as rosy as imagined. One of the biggest pitfalls of blindly pursuing economic development is that it often results in the neglect of other important aspects of well-being, like social and environmental stability. China's remarkable growth over the past four decades has brought with it skyrocketing carbon emissions, dangerous levels of pollution and unfettered exploitation of natural resources, all of which have taken a severe toll on the well-being of its people and environment. On the other side of the spectrum, nations like Bhutan and Costa Rica have shown that sustainable growth, where social, environmental and economic well-being are given equal attention, can lead to a more holistic development. This development view, which is redefining growth beyond the narrow confines of economic indicators alone, provides a valuable alternative to the conventional economic narrative, where more growth is always better, and any trade-offs with social or environmental factors are deemed acceptable.\nIn conclusion, while economic development can help promote a country's well-being, its impact must be viewed through a more nuanced lens that accounts for the various factors that determine the overall welfare of a nation. Economic growth should not come at the expense of a society's safety and health or the environment\u2019s sustainability. Instead, it should be balanced with other essential factors like social stability, environmental preservation, and equitable distribution of resources to create a more sustainable and all-encompassing well-being for a country. Only then can there be a true, comprehensive appreciation of the benefits and limitations of economic development on a country's long-term well-being.",
                "acknowledge its importance, albeit indirectly.\nHowever, it must be pointed out that economic development alone does not equate to well-being for a nation. There have been many instances where economic development proceeds at the expense of the environment or individual liberties. The Industrial Revolution led to immense growth and prosperity for nations like Great Britain, but it also led to pollution and the exploitation of workers, causing untold suffering and long-term negative consequences. Even today, China's growth as an industrial powerhouse has led to serious air and water pollution, causing health concerns for its citizens. Similarly, the pursuit of economic growth may come at the expense of individual liberties as the government may prioritize economic interests over the welfare of its citizens. This may lead to the repression of dissent or greater income inequality, both of which are detrimental to the well-being of a nation's citizens.\nIn conclusion, while economic development does play a significant role in a nation's well-being, we must be careful to acknowledge that well-being is a multifaceted concept, incorporating social, cultural, and environmental aspects. Economic development as the sole measure of well-being can be misleading and may result in a myopic view of progress. As such, we must strive for a balanced approach that seeks to achieve economic goals while taking into account other factors that contribute to a nation's well-being.",
                "acknowledge that some form of it is necessary for the survival of the nation.\nHowever, it is important to also recognize that economic development does not guarantee the well-being of the nation. It is not just the amount of money a nation has that determines the happiness of its citizens, but rather how that money is used to improve their lives. For instance, a nation with high GDP per capita but significant income inequality and lack of social welfare programs would still not guarantee the well-being of its citizens. A well-diversified economy that promotes job growth, research and innovation, and sustainable development, however, would have a better chance of providing well-being for its citizens. Additionally, in some cases, economic development may come at a high environmental and social cost. Unchecked industrialization and development may lead to pollution, destruction of ecosystems, displacement of indigenous communities, and other social issues that could harm the nation's well-being in the long run.\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that economic development is a critical aspect of a country's well-being. However, it is not the only factor that determines the welfare of the people. A truly well-developed nation would prioritize the well-being of its citizens, aligning economic progress with social and environmental sustainability.",

The ill effects of capitalism, with its focus on endless growth and maximisation of profits, are now increasingly apparent with the environmental degradation and depletion of resources that inevitably follow. Moreover, the obsession with economic growth does not necessarily translate into better healthcare, education or quality of life. For example, while Singapore is often lauded for its remarkable economic development since independence, it still grapples with inequality, resulting in a large income gap. In addition, the emphasis on material development often obscures the needs of more intangible factors such as mental and emotional well-being, social harmony, and environmental sustainability. For instance, economic development at the expense of ecological balance, and the destruction of natural habitats can create a collective sense of despair, frustration and futility. Thus, it is necessary to go beyond simplistic assumptions that economic growth alone is the key to a nation's welfare and recognise the importance of a more holistic approach.\nIn conclusion, it cannot be denied that while economic development is crucial to the well-being of a nation, it is not the only factor necessary. While the conventional indicators of economic growth such as GDP do provide some insights into the well-being of a nation, the consequences of an unbridled pursuit of economic growth should not be disregarded. Instead, it is critical that policymakers consider a multitude of factors, including social and environmental durability, and acknowledge that the well-being of a nation depends on more than just economic growth alone.",

It includes factors like healthcare, education, safety and security, and social welfare. In fact, some nations may have achieved impressive economic growth, but still fall short in other aspects of well-being. For example, China's rapid industrialisation has undoubtedly lifted millions out of poverty, but it has come at a steep cost to the environment and social welfare. On the other hand, Scandinavian countries like Norway and Sweden have a high standard of living, to which their economic development has undoubtedly contributed, but they also place a strong emphasis on social welfare, healthcare and education. These nations have shown that a well-rounded approach that considers the non-material aspects of well-being is also important in ensuring a country's long-term sustainability and development.\nIn conclusion, while economic development is undoubtedly a crucial factor in ensuring the well-being of a nation, it is not the sole determining factor. A multi-dimensional approach that takes into account both material and non-material aspects of well-being is necessary for a country's long-term sustainability and development.",

Nations with high GDP are not necessarily nations with superior well-being for their citizens, as in the United States where full-time jobs with benefits have been replaced with part-time work without benefits. Thus, even with economic development, inequalities in wealth distribution and loopholes in laws, can lead to dwindling well-being. Additionally, environmental concerns would also challenge the idea that mere economic development can promise well-being. Nations like China have continuously struggled to balance economic development with environmental protection. In the pursuit of economic supremacy, pollution levels skyrocketed, leading to the infamous \"airpocalypse\". Thus, the notion that economic development guarantees well-being becomes problematic as it fails to account for a holistic definition of well-being and weighs the costs of well-being at a dangerous expense to the environment.\nIn conclusion, while there is certainly truth in the claim that a nation's well-being relies on its economic development, it must be noted with caution that this is not the be-all and end-all of matters. Economic development can indeed provide the nation material security and self-sufficiency, but it must also be balanced with addressing income inequality and environmental considerations.

A country may have significant economic development, but if the people living within the nation do not have access to basic needs, then the well-being of the nation is hardly realized. Take, for example, Somalia, a nation that is reportedly ranked as one of the poorest nations in the world but maintains a degree of social cohesion despite having a fragile government. Despite its reported lack of economic development, the nation has a rich culture and living amidst the challenges that poverty brings, its people have persevered and succeeded in keeping their society going. Therefore, while economic development is certainly important, it must not come at the cost of basic needs or overdependence on material well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that economic development can play a role in ensuring the well-being of a nation, it is crucial to understand that a country's well-being must not be restricted to material gains alone. Factors such as happiness, healthcare, education, and social cohesion are also essential for the overall well-being of a nation.

It provides citizens with job opportunities, higher income levels, technological advancements, and better access to healthcare facilities, among other benefits. However, it is important to note that economic development alone does not determine a country's overall well-being.

Economic development translates into higher income levels, better job opportunities, technological advancement, and better healthcare facilities. All of these things help to improve the standard of living and well-being of a country's citizens.

Despite some existence of the impatience and frustration that rears its ugly head every once in a while, the fatalistic notion of consequent irrelevance as inevitable overlooks the need for adjustment to changing demographic shifts, which although uncomfortable, is rather temporary. As much as there are a number of societies still negotiating the changes, there are many that have successfully adjusted its mindsets and policies to support the needs of the growing silver generation in their population. From atop the list of ageing populations, Japan has successfully found a place in its heart and well-oiled economy to accommodate the elderly, who take on meaningful tasks with the traditional skills few youths have, and who contribute to the community in ways considered less effortful and more suited to the realities of old age. In other ageing societies, the old are far from just useless burdens, cast aside and preserved in the name of ethical duty. It is evident that besides the initial adjustment and irreverent few voices that cast doubt, the old have a place in society.\nAdmittedly, some sympathetic individuals have expressed pity and concern for the old who they perceive to have no place today, considering the degree of technological advancement that drives our world today. There is fear that the rapid progress and seemingly ever-changing processes are far too much for the old who would supposedly feel out of place and obsolete, in a way that the old from other times would plausibly not. Putting aside the fact that this conjecture is a construct of imagination and laced with some well-intentioned stereotypes, this view, in its zeal for compassion, under-estimated the ability of the old to learn and overlooked the abundance of resources now available to quench the insatiable thirst for knowledge and self-improvement, both of which are unaffected by age. As much as age has been a convenient excuse to justify a lack of interest, effort, and success, especially when it comes to learning, this argument fails to hold water when we consider the sheer amount of options now available to facilitate the learning of the older generation. The subsequent silver invasion into domains once solely dominated by the young, such as social media platforms, reveal the undeniable truth that when the old desire it, they have a wealth of resources to enable them to get it. Today, they reign over social media platforms that the young hurriedly left behind, finding more ways to make use of the platforms, be it livestreams of garage sales or sharing of the latest health tips. The elderly are able to, and have embraced technology, thus cannot be considered obsolete, especially when we realise that the efforts to help the old and resources provided are, in fact, clear indications of the continued relevance of the old.\nIn the face of the arguments on empowerment and resources, the most staunch would still insist that the frailty of old age means less place for the old in society. This is arguably exacerbated by the limits that have been pushed in terms of medically-preserved decrepitude. As individuals age, it seems logical to no longer retain the physical prowess associated with youth in their peak physical states. Medical issues seem to creep up and ageing bodies try to negotiate the issues to compensate for, and carry on, some semblance of life. The feared fall of an elderly, the dreaded hip replacement or knee replacement, are some physical issues faced. The intangible senile dementia and other conditions add to the fray, with the old already embroiled in this private struggle. Thankfully, the concerns surrounding health in old age have been largely mitigated by the powerful strides in technology that has the ability to negate the ravages of time. Physiology has been thoroughly studied and many treatments and interventions developed. From the media's hype over ordinary women who defy time by looking like they are their children's ages, we can see that the old have access to and employed techniques to overcome these physical limitations. Even for the mind, there are many pharmaceutical interventions, such as to delay and even reverse brain ageing. Clearly, technology can, or at least soon, ensure the old still have a place in society. I do concede that such tools and benefits may not be available to all the elderly in every society. The availability of the resources and efforts are still predicated on one's wealth and thus not readily accessible to everyone. Still, the circumstance that the old find themselves in is not without reprieve. As we look beyond today, we need to help the old and those without resources to be able to seek the help they need.\nAll in all, our cynicism, fears, and criticisms, may tempt us into downplaying the place for the old, but we need to keep a rational mind to focus on the place they have. With the world staring down a silver tsunami, it is best we make pace with any existing issues to help our society, young and old through the next set of challenges. A convenient scapegoat the old may be, it is still unwise to give them up as sacrifice whenever any polarising poll comes around.

The view that older adults are not contributing to society often stems from ageism, a form of discrimination and prejudice against elderly persons. This mistreatment of the elderly is harmful as it perpetuates a cycle of exclusion and marginalisation that can have negative effects on older adults' physical and emotional well-being. To combat this, society needs to take a holistic view of the elderly\u2019s contributions and appreciate their worth.\n\nIt is indispensable, then, that society take an inclusive approach to the elderly's participation. Strategies such as lifelong learning programs, retraining opportunities, and other measures that can help equip older adults with the skills necessary to participate in the modern workforce must become part of policy efforts. Moreover, citing technology as a barrier to entry into the workforce should not exclude older adults, and indeed, there is much evidence showing that older adults are willing to adapt to technological advancements when given the chance. Government policies aimed at supporting and empowering the elderly, such as healthcare and social welfare programs, are critical to ensuring that older adults have dignity, economic security and access to healthcare.\n\nIn conclusion, whilst some might argue that the elderly have no place in modern society, there are numerous reasons why this view is not tenable. Older adults have much to offer society as caregivers, volunteers and active participants in the workforce, and there is a need for society to develop strategies that encourage their participation, rather than exclude them.

The explosion in the ageing population can indeed impose a heavy burden on a society that may have under-prepared for the reality, but this burden is far from insurmountable. Governments in many countries have put in place many measures to meet the needs of the elderly, including the provision of healthcare, retirement support, and the creation of age-friendly environments. It is only because of these measures that the old can now have more extended longevity, \"outliving their usefulness\" and having the time to make their own contribution to society. The old are no longer the passive recipients of societal goodwill but are instead active contributors to the same society they helped build. They can impart their wisdom, knowledge and life experiences to the younger people of society, and the younger people can learn from them. The old may not always have the latest information and knowledge, but they provide something invaluable in their life experiences and wisdom gained through years of living. Hence, it would be a fallacy to believe that the old do not have a place in society today, for they continue to provide an essential foundation of ideas, traditions, and values which the younger can learn from and build upon. Indeed, as the world gets more complex and less certain, the old become ever more relevant, where they can help to provide a degree of stability that is sorely lacking in the rapidly-changing world, and it is precisely for this reason why the older people are deserving of their place in society.",

It is indeed true that ageism is a real issue that continues to fester in modern society, with the elderly facing increased discrimination in terms of job opportunities, healthcare, and even social status. It is also true that the younger generation must shoulder the burden of supporting the elderly, both financially and emotionally. However, to conclude that the old have no place in society is a bleak and nihilistic view, one that ignores the many contributions and roles that the elderly can still play. The old in society today can offer invaluable experience, wisdom, and guidance in a world that is becoming increasingly complex and fragmented. They can be mentors, teachers, counsellors, and valuable members of society who can still make significant contributions to the world. Their presence and contributions make society more robust, diverse, and inclusive, benefiting everyone, young and old alike.\nIn conclusion, while there are certainly challenges and issues that some elderly people face in today's society, to suggest that they have no place is unfair, untrue, and pessimistic. The old have contributed significantly to society throughout their lives, and they continue to do so in numerous ways, as long as they have the opportunities, respect, and support that they deserve. It is the responsibility of younger generations to acknowledge and appreciate the value that the elderly bring to the table, and to work towards a world where they can continue to thrive and make a difference.",

Yet, as society is different with its variant changes in traditions, culture, and demographics, we also should understand that there deserves to be a place for people of all ages. While it may be tempting to dismiss the old and their views entirely, doing so would be overlooking the benefits that they can offer the young. As much as acknowledging the challenges the old face, it is immensely beneficial to recognise their positive role in society.

For example, Singapore's \"Merdeka Generation Package\" seeks to provide support and recognition for individuals who have contributed to Singapore's development, in effect, acknowledging the contributions of the old, which would not make sense if they were truly considered burdensome. Moreover, the old continue to occupy positions of power and influence, as seen in the political arena, with leaders such as the Prime Minister of Japan and the former President of the United States, who served well into their seventies. As long as the old continue to contribute and make a difference in society, the idea that they have no place cannot be further from the truth.\nIn conclusion, while it may be tempting to dismiss the old as having no place in society today, this perspective is deeply flawed. It is important to recognise the contributions of the old, not just in the past but also present. The dynamic interplay between the old and the young is essential in our rapidly-changing world, where new ideas and values are prized, and societal norms are adapting to a new normal. The old may hold onto some deeply-held beliefs that may be out of touch with the current reality, but their role is vital in ensuring that we do not lose sight of our values and traditions. They are the guardians of the past and the co-creators of the present and future. The old most certainly have a place in society today and will continue to do so in the future.",

Such a view is, however, myopic, for it fails to acknowledge that instead of being burdensome, many older people in society today continue to contribute to the wellbeing of society, and consequently, to have a place therein. The geriatric population has had massively beneficial impacts towards science and its pursuit. Aged scholars continue to produce insightful works of great value; not to mention the sufficiency and sagacity of their life experiences that cannot be obtained through textbooks, adding depth to their intellectual contributions. Furthermore, by necessity, the older generation must possess life insights different from younger people. It is not even merely about supposed life lessons, as much as it is the deep understanding of people's conditions as they wade through thick and think in society. The experience that the older generation brings could prove to be invaluable in reframing discussions. The old, as a group, with their wealth of experience, could find or identify challenges and identify deeply buried difficulties and craft solutions for society today. It would be unwise to discard the input of such valuable contributors to society based solely on age.\nI am sure that there are factors that lead one to agree that the old do not have any place in society today. In truth however, the situation is much more nuanced than these critics care to admit. Instead, the old have remained invaluable anchors in tumultuous and shifting times, bearing the weight of responsibility of being society's moral compass. They continue to contribute towards the almost inevitable advancement of society by bringing a new perspective into society's latest developments yet offering an array of solutions stemming from a long career witnessing the world's happenings.",

However, this view fails to appreciate the magnitude and number of efforts put in place to fulfil the needs of the older people in society, from pension schemes to senior-friendly facilities. The old have changed the way the society operates and led to their increased numbers, with an unspoken recognition that such major shifts require long-term planning, commitment, and acceptance of the shifting power dynamics. Such efforts show that the old have a unique place in society, with their contributions far surpassing what the young can easily achieve, at least not without some guidance and direction from the older generations. We can argue that by working towards planned retirement, the old have indeed created a place for themselves in society, one that is not at the expense of the young but complementary to it. The older people have certainly struggled through life, playing a crucial role in building the society in which the younger generation lives today. It is, therefore, erroneous to suggest that the old have no place in the world today.\nIn conclusion, even as the world constantly changes, the importance of the older population cannot be underestimated, and to suggest they have no place in society is a misguided sentiment at best. Although the society may face challenges in adaptation, with the old struggling to keep pace with the rapid changes, the old are still an integral part of society. We need to validate their contributions by according them the necessary respect, acknowledgement and realise, values that would similarly be accorded to the younger generation when they reach that age. It is only then that we can appreciate the contributions of both old and young, recognise what each brings to the table and appreciate the vitality of these different generations.",

Firstly, the idea that the old are a burden on society inherently fails to recognise the contributions that the elderly have made, particularly in terms of social and economic capital that they have generated over the years. Secondly, it is too facile to suggest that the relationship between the young and the old is one of animosity or that there is a lack of understanding or cooperation between the two generations. Discounting these realities only serves to reinforce the narrow-minded perspectives that characterise the anti-ageist stances. Therefore, it would be incomplete to contend that the old have no place in society today.\nIn conclusion, while it is true that the old today may seem out of touch, unable to integrate, keep up with, or even comprehend many aspects of society today, the older generation does have its critical role to play in today's society. We must acknowledge that the old are more relevant than ever before. They bring along their experience, wisdom, and perspective that the younger generation can only hope to attain over a lifetime. They serve as a reminder that society progresses slowly and cautiously so as not to lose sight of the values that ensure stability and continuity.

The emphasis on intergenerational bonding, the provision of education, and the encouragement of recreation and continued learning have all been initiated or expanded upon compared to the past. These changes in opinion are proof that the old have a place in society today, a place that is rightfully theirs, regardless of the cynicism or ignorance that may attempt to dislodge them from their position.\nIt is clear that the old have a place in society today, offering the very resistance that helps to preserve our world in a time constantly spinning off its hinges. The acknowledgement of their value is not one of charity or obligation, but one of necessity, as their continued contribution to society endows the next generation with the very knowledge and values that are essential to fight for our future.

The elderly now have numerous channels and platforms to voice out their needs, seek recourse, and to contribute to society in the ways that they can. Additionally, the advanced medical technology coupled with the ample resources have lengthened the lifespan of individuals, making it possible and consequential for a significant number of individuals to reach the age when previously only a few could hope to achieve. For this reason, the notion of the older people as burdens is flimsy at best and ignores the contributions the elderly continue to make to society, often as volunteers, carers, mentors and guides. It is evident then that the old have a place in society today, perhaps much more than any other time in history.\n\nIn conclusion, while arguments can be made for the old having no place in societies driven by change, and ageism- fuelled by prejudices, it is undeniable that the elderly have a critical place in society today. They have a unique perspective that can lend balance to the radicalism of the youth, serve as a safeguard against unstable trends and practices in society and are themselves contributing members of society.

            "human_gen_truncate": "n women, especially the Dalit women, has been made the scapegoat for the division and lack of progress in the Indian society. Yet, such a fatalistic and pessimistic view overlooks the possibility of some progress and maturity in the society, albeit in the long run. The risk-averse approach focusses too much on the short-run threat, without giving due consideration to the possible progress that can be gained in the long run. This is not to say that the endeavour would be eventually successful or to even bear some fruit in gender equality. Instead, it is entirely likely that we would be condemned to the perpetual over-compensation that the pursuit of gender equality serves to constantly result in. Rather, what makes the endeavour meaningful, and not foolish as claimed by the pessimists, is the development of the maturity of the populace and, dare I suggest, the advancement of society and civilisation. As much as we have yet to have any true equality of the sexes, we can infer the potential of such pursuits of equality between criminals and non-criminals. The enlightened approach seen in the Nordic countries had been sparked by the humanitarian emphasis on equality. Norway's revolutionary, world's-first commitment to equality, seen in the Halden Prison and the Bastoy Island Prison, had its genesis in the pursuit of equality at the realisation of the cruel ways previously employed on juvenile delinquents in the Boys' Home on Bastoy Island itself. The contemporary island retreat of a prison is testament to the progress such pursuits can bring. While true that these Scandinavian countries are, for now, rather lonely in such enlightenment, what is undeniable is the prerequisite of the pursuit for equality in the long-term progress of the society. Hence, as much as the pursuit of equality between the sexes is unlikely to bear fruit, given that it is perhaps one of the only inequalities backed by actual differences in biology, the pursuit itself is hardly foolish as it is a necessary first step in societal progress.\nOn a more practical note, the admittedly futile effort is still not foolish when we consider the actual need for change in gender roles and responsibilities brought about by the changing circumstances, which the pursuit would facilitate. The world today is changing rapidly in terms of technological advancement, altering the situation in societies, cost of living, and also work demands. Along with these, society's expectations with respect to gender roles, procreation, and family, have also shifted. Some more significantly than other perhaps, but nonetheless, changed and are still changing. As a result, the entrenched gender inequality would prove to be a hurdle for the required changes to keep up with changing societal needs. Hence, even when the pursuit of gender inequality would likely fail to bring about true equality in terms of access to opportunities, it is a worthwhile endeavour as it crucially paves the way for much needed changes that facilitate society's adapting to the changing circumstances in order to survive, much less thrive. This can be seen in the Finnish society, which is often held up as a guiding light for equality, where females are given concessions and support so that motherhood would not unfairly penalise them. Putting aside the controversial argument that this is equality in practice, when so clearly the men do not have access to similar concessions, what is evident is that the society has benefitted from the pursuit of equality, in that the effort has been leveraged upon to make much-needed changes to the landscape of work and socio-exploitation of human resources to ensure Finland's continued survival in the modern world. The same can be said of the Chinese in mainland China, which in the name of gender equality, has made being a leftover woman a badge of honour to harness the previously unexploited potential of the female population. In South Sudan, the practice of abusing fattening pills to achieve the societal standard of feminine beauty, at the expense of health, is now criticised, again under the banner of gender equality, to ensure the populace moves away from such wastage of resources and onto the empowerment that would help improve the pitiable plight of the impoverished nation saddled by traditional notions steeped in gender subjugation. Evidently, as much as the pursuit is indeed futile, the potential of the endeavour as a means to ensure society is able to keep up with changing circumstances makes it far from foolish.\nIn all, the pursuit of gender equality is likely to be futile, given the complexities and subjectivity of the notion, not to mention the entrenched mindsets that hinder any effort. Still, it is far from foolish considering the consequent debate, empowerment, and its potential as a tool for progress and advancement. As much as it is a thorny topic and a source of frustration for many, we must resist the temptation to surrender the pursuit using the simplistic assertion that futility equates folly. Instead, we should recognise the excuse for what it is and look beyond its immediate futility to recognise its central role in our growth, be it personal or societal. Perhaps another way of looking at it is to realise that it is more foolish to succumb and accept limitations as told, for if Serena Williams did, she would not have made it to the top hundred list, nor become the inspiration for so many in the world.",

Additionally, when women are able to work and earn a living, they are able to provide for themselves and their families, reducing poverty and improving overall quality of life.\n\nAnother argument against pursuing equality between the sexes is that it is futile because it is impossible to completely eradicate sexism and discrimination. While it is true that there will always be some level of sexism and discrimination in society, this does not mean that we should not try to eliminate it. Just because a problem is difficult to solve does not mean that it is not worth addressing. In fact, the fact that sexism and discrimination are so deeply ingrained in society is exactly why it is so important to address them.\n\nFinally, pursuing equality between the sexes is a matter of justice and human rights. Women are human beings and deserve to be treated with dignity, respect, and equality. Denying women their basic human rights is not only unjust, but it goes against the very principles of democracy and freedom. As a society, we should strive to create a world where everyone, regardless of gender, race, or any other characteristic, is treated equally and fairly.\n\nIn conclusion, pursuing equality between the sexes is not only necessary, but it is also the only way to create a just and equitable society. While there are those who argue that it is futile or foolish, the benefits of equality are clear. When men and women are treated equally and given the same opportunities, everyone benefits. It is our responsibility as a society to work towards a world where everyone, regardless of gender, is able to live a life of dignity and respect.",

Even worse, some argue that the pursuit of gender equality may actually perpetuate certain forms of discrimination and inequality by placing too much emphasis on gender rather than on individual merit and ability. Hence, it is understandable why many would consider the pursuit of gender equality to be both futile and foolish, a waste of resources and energy that could be better spent on other more pressing issues facing society.\nIn conclusion, while I do recognize the futility and challenges associated with the pursuit of gender equality, I do not believe that it is foolish. The debate that ensues from such a pursuit is vital, as it helps to raise awareness and create a more equitable and just society. Additionally, the pursuit of gender equality can also serve to empower the most vulnerable members of society, by highlighting their plight and demanding change on their behalf. At the same time, we must also be cognizant of the challenges and risks associated with such a pursuit, and work to address them in a thoughtful and judicious manner.

The argument that the pursuit of gender equality and its implications may well be the downfall of an already turbulent society is a sobering thought that must not be dismissed lightly. Yet, even with this argument, I still do not think the pursuit is foolish since I focus on the long-term goals.\nIn the long run, the pursuit of gender equality, though certainly challenging, is essential as it affirms the respect and dignity of the individual. Gender equality, being a naturally fundamental right of every human being, speaks to the innate desire of every person to be treated with respect and dignity, without being denied opportunities or rights based on their gender. The pursuit of gender equality is thus not a foolish endeavour, since it is a necessary step towards rebuilding an equitable, inclusive society that affirms the inherent dignity of every individual, regardless of their gender. This could entail a long and arduous struggle, but it is a struggle worth fighting for since the long-term gains to society outweigh the short-term pains.\nIn conclusion, I do not agree that the pursuit of equality between sexes is only futile but foolish. While admitting it may not bring about the desired outcomes, I believe that the discussions it sparks, the empowerment of the vulnerable, and the long-term gains for society make the pursuit immensely valuable, and, hence, not at all foolish.",

However, I do acknowledge the realities of societal frictions and disunity that may ensue, and hence advocate for greater respect for tradition and norms where needed.

In an increasingly unequal world, the pursuit of gender equality serves as a beacon of hope and inspiration, even if the attainment of such lofty ideals may be far beyond our reach.

However, I firmly believe that the pursuit is not a foolish endeavour, as some may argue. The ongoing discussion on the topic is valuable to our society, and the effort to empower the vulnerable members of the society is meaningful.

Hence, a sense of history sheds Singapore wisdom in her future dealings with realpolitik in international relations.\nSimultaneously, having a sense of history allows citizens to form a sense of identity and belonging. The social stability in modern Singapore\u2019s social stability did not come without challenges. During the 1950 to the mid-1960s, post-war Singapore underwent a dark age of civil unrest, most of which occurred on racial lines. While still part of Malaysia, the 1964 Racial riots left 36 dead and 556 injured when violence between ethnic Chinese and Malays groups. The conflict was spurred by members of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant political party in peninsula Malaysia, inciting Malays in Singapore to violently press for their \u2018Special Rights.\u2019 At that time, the local PAP government campaigned for a \u201cMalaysian Malaysia\u201d in the Malayan Solidarity Convention with other Malaysian opposition parties. The dark ages were formative on Singapore\u2019s practice of \u201cthe principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society\u201d upon independence. These were the very words declared by Mr. Lee Kuan Yew in the Proclamation of Singapore. The rights of minority groups such as the Malays and Indians were ensured by the government, and these minorities were accorded political representation in parliament under the Group Representation Constituency electoral system. Housing and education policies were made such that the races intermingled and embraced diversity, and this has helped weave Singapore\u2019s social fabric. A sense of history hence gives us the ability to better understand and reaffirm the ideals Singapore are built upon, and how we can continue to embrace diversity and not the \u2018universality\u2019 that certain peoples deem as more \u2018right\u2019 than other competing \u2018rights.\u2019\nThis understanding is even more important nowadays, especially when considering how globalisation brings about more intense and rapid social and cultural exchanges. A look back into our past can bring an awakening in the citizenry as to how we can stem incidents such as the unprecedented Little India Riots in 2014, which were sparked by migrant workers over xenophobic concerns. This is on a global backdrop of increased labour flows and migration. A sense of history hence helps Singapore to build upon the \u2018Singapore Identity\u2019, strengthening her multicultural and inter-religious roots. The mutual respect for other will be a helpful implement as the world continues its transit into late-modernity. As the Chinese proverb goes \u201cWhen you drink water, remember the source.\u201d Singaporeans should not forget how racial, religious and even ethnic harmony, not tolerance, has made it possible for them to prosper economically vis-a-vis good governance and pragmatic policies. This has allowed Singapore to remain relevant to the world despite being a small nation-state.\nHistory might never repeat itself, not at least in the same form. However, the process of societal development and nation building, and the conditions which shaped these processes, should not be forgotten in the least. The greatest utility a sense of history gives is in teaching Singapore and her citizenry important lessons about human nature, society and the real world. Among the team of Singapore\u2019s founding fathers was Mr. S. Rajaratnam. He famously proclaimed in a speech that independent Singapore was \u201clike a nun that had wandered by accident into a red-light district.\u201d This was a harsh, yet truthful, description of our situation in Southeast Asia, a harsh geopolitical environment which has also been a traditional battleground for great and emerging powers. To continue to remain relevant to the world and thrive in a world of globalisation, Singaporeans should never forget our historical roots. They remind us that success is an act of human endeavor and should be maintained by so, not a godsend, especially to a small nation state.\n",

Overcoming these issues taught Singaporeans that they are resilient, hardworking, and solution-oriented. Being solution-oriented rather than being problem-oriented is a key trait of Singapore's successes, making it one of the most respected nations in Asia and beyond. In addition, Singapore's success in overcoming obstacles indicates that the future generation must be resilient, composed with a critical problem-solving capacity to achieve the shared goal to impact society positively.\n\nLastly, a sense of history helps us to anticipate and prepare for the future. Singapore's historical experience has demonstrated the importance of consistently adapting and embracing change. Embracing change is critical as Singapore has become a global player in trade, innovation, and technological advancement. Many countries have found themselves lagging behind as they failed to anticipate their future and prepare pragmatically fast. For instance, Singapore's foresight in the utilization of technology has helped it gain international recognition as an innovative country globally. Singaporeans must anticipate the future by preparing mental models, imagining the multiple outcomes and scenarios to ensure they are ready for what comes next.\n\nCulture, tradition, and identity are all values that are derived from the past. Singapore's sense of history is integral because it constructs a solid foundation for citizens situating them within a particular human story. The sense of history gives Singaporeans a common ground to appreciate their past, something that strengthens their present and ensures a bright future. In conclusion, the sense of history should continue to be an essential facet of Singapore's society in shaping its future. The retelling of past events should lead to a not-so-distant future to impact society positively, and, for future generations, the enforcement of the lessons drawn from the country's history will serve as a guidepost to ensure the continuity of Singapore as a nation.",

Singapore\u2019s history teaches us that this harmony was not achieved overnight. Despite the prevalent multiculturalism that governs Singapore today, the preamble of the republic\u2019s 1959 Constitution was designed to \u201cassure to all\u201d Chinese, Malays and Indians \u201cequality\u201d in opportunities, status and treatment before the law. Singapore, upon independence, faced then the challenge of forging a national identity amidst her multi-ethnic citizenry. This was eventually buttressed by the founding fathers\u2019 pro-active \u2018social engineering\u2019 policies and pluralist politics. These principles, religiously adhered to by Singaporean statesmen since then, prove that with hard work, political will and understanding history, multi-ethnicity and multiculturalism can be entrenched and maintained in the society, without debilitating racial strife and conflict.\nIn conclusion, a sense of history is not only important, but is necessary when looking to Singapore\u2019s future development. This is especially so given the complex geo-political and socio-cultural challenges she faces. Without a sense of history, we could never understand the long-term implications of certain policies, or the delicate racial dynamics that exist within Singapore\u2019s society. History also provides the invaluable lessons on what worked in the past, and what did not. This presents a roadmap for future success by avoiding previous pitfalls. In the words of George Santayana, \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it\u201d. The shaping of the future of Singapore\u2019s society requires continual reflection on Singapore\u2019s past experiences, to ensure that past successes are not forgotten and future possibilities explored, understood and internalised.",
                "cy.\nIn addition to external relations, a sense of history is also indispensable for shaping Singapore\u2019s socio-cultural landscape. The foundation of the modern Singaporean nation-state is multiculturalism. Singaporeans of all races and religions are able to live together harmoniously, work together and share a common identity despite their differences. This was a huge challenge given the disparate ethnic and cultural groups that made up Singapore\u2019s population in the early 1960s. The People\u2019s Action Party (PAP) was the only political party then that offered Singaporeans a true multiracial platform, free of the traditional racial and religious divisions that had been used by the colonial powers to exploit the population. It was the PAP that carved out the \u2018Singapore identity\u2019 that has come to represent the nation today. This identity has been shaped by Singapore\u2019s tumultuous history, where a pluralistic society based on meritocracy, pragmatism and social harmony was created from multiculturalism and multilingualism, integration, and a shared sense of mission to build a nation from scratch. This sense of history is key to forging a sustainable national identity that can withstand economic, social and political challenges, and provide the basis for strong cultural cohesiveness in an increasingly globalised and complex world.\nFinally, Singapore is undergoing a period of transition \u2013 economically, socially, and politically. The impact of technological disruption on the economy, the ageing population, rising social inequalities, and the pressure on the government to be more responsive and democratic, all point to the need for Singaporeans to have a sense of history to help them navigate the uncertain waters ahead. The historical legacies of Singapore's system of governance, its developmental state model of economic success and its social policies, provide a solid foundation for Singapore to move forward. A sense of history allows Singaporeans to internalise these legacies, and use them to adapt and innovate for the future.\nIn conclusion, a sense of history is essential for shaping the future of Singapore\u2019s society. By understanding the historical events that have shaped Singapore\u2019s current situation, her founding values, strengths, and weaknesses, Singaporeans can confront the challenges of the future with greater wisdom and farsightedness. History should not be seen as a ghost but as a beacon that illuminates the path forward.",

Singapore has always been a melting pot of different cultures, with Chinese, Malays, Indians, and Eurasians making up the bulk of society. However, the concept of a \u2018Singaporean\u2019 identity has always been a contested one, especially with the \u2018Malaysian Malaysia\u2019 campaign during the separation crisis. The ability to forge a shared national identity based not on ethnicity or religion, but on universal values such as meritocracy, equality, and justice, is testament to the fortitude and vision of Lee Kuan Yew and his team. This shared national identity has allowed Singapore to rise above cultural and ethnic divides, and resulted in a strong sense of national unity and pride. Without a sense of history and appreciation for the foundations of Singapore\u2019s national identity, this sense of unity may be lost as younger generations grow up in an increasingly globalised and multicultural world where individualism reigns.\nIn conclusion, the utility of a sense of history in shaping the future of Singapore\u2019s society cannot be dismissed. While the circumstances which shaped modern Singapore were vastly different from what we face today, the historical baggage and foundations of the republic\u2019s success in building a functioning, prosperous and harmonious society remain a crucial part of our national heritage. By understanding and appreciating the historical lessons and tenets that have guided Singapore to where she is today, we can better navigate the future challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, and continue to build a vibrant, united and forward-looking society.",

A strong national identity is essential for a country, especially a small one like Singapore, to stay united and cohesive amidst challenges such as globalisation, changing demographics, and regional and global threats. The Singapore story and its historical narrative has and continues to this day to inspire and bind Singaporeans to their country and what it stands for.\nIn conclusion, a sense of history is necessary for guiding Singapore\u2019s future development.

Our food, language, customs, and values signify the amalgamation of different cultures that have co-existed on this island for centuries. As a society, we must continue to preserve our unique identity and build upon it. By doing so, we can leverage on our cultural heritage to be a global hub that attracts the world to our shores. A sense of history not only gives us a sense of pride in what we have accomplished but also serves as a reminder of what it takes to preserve our success.\nIn conclusion, a sense of history is indispensable to shaping the future of Singapore\u2019s society. Our history provides a foundation of where we came from, how we got here, and who we are. It serves as a reminder of the trials and tribulations that our founding fathers had to overcome to build our present. By studying our history, we can understand the principles and values that made us successful, and apply them to overcome the unique challenges that we face moving forward. As the saying goes, \u201cthose who do not learn from history are doomed to repeat it.\u201d Singapore\u2019s past successes are a testament to the importance of a sense of history, as we continue to build upon our rich cultural heritage to make Singapore a great nation.",
                "cy.\nIn addition to purely geo-political reasons, having a sense of history is also crucial to the socio-cultural development of Singapore. As Singapore continues to be a melting pot of diverse cultures and ethnic backgrounds, it is important that they can coexist in harmony. The history of Singapore tells us that this was not always the case. The Singaporean race riots of the 1960s, for instance, which were sparked by racial and religious tensions, caused social chaos. Without an understanding of the mistakes of the past, Singapore might be doomed to repeat them. A sense of history therefore provides the moral compass needed to navigate socio-cultural challenges with better understanding, thus the framework to manage deep systemic entrenchments of beliefs and values needed to build a cohesive society.\nIn conclusion, history should be regarded as a precious resource in shaping Singapore\u2019s future society. The successes, challenges and mistakes of the past are learning opportunities for Singaporeans. While the circumstances in the past and present may differ vastly, the fundamental principles that shaped Singapore are constant and serve as evergreen guidance.

Understanding the experiences of Singapore\u2019s forefathers, who had to live in the postcolonial era of self-determination and strain relations between different ethnic and cultural groups, helps in building empathy and inculcating a culture of respect for diversity. Singapore had and continues to foster a sense of togetherness and inclusivity, unlike neighbouring countries with ethnically homogeneous populations. This is a testament that Singapore has not only achieved economic growth but also cultural and social harmony, an accomplishment aided by the ruling party's emphasis on multiculturalism that was forged during the 1960s. This policy continues to date via different social schemes and National Education programs such as Total Defence Day. Such instruction inculcates a sense of patriotism and pride, leading to deeper integration and common national identity. Hence, a sense of history is invaluable for enriching national identity and facilitating harmonious relations between distinct cultural and societal groups, which are core requirements to tackling the challenges of the 21st century.\nIn conclusion, in bringing Singapore forward, a sense of history is vital to understand the foundational principles of her success, and the complex geopolitical and sociocultural landscape within which we live in and navigate. Such knowledge helps in identifying and resolving future challenges. Nurturing the values of a multiracial and multicultural society through national education efforts is imperative to maintain the harmony and prosperity of Singapore.",

The collective memory of a multicultural society that has experienced unprecedented threats to their survival and come past it as one can instill a sense of \u2018Singapore Son-Motherhood\u2019 and inspire society to keep Singapore well and alive. Remembrance of the past imparts to Singaporeans the gravity of the identity of \u2018One People, One Nation, One Singapore\u2019. Hence, it can help shape Singapore society\u2019s future by galvanising the concept of multiculturalism, respect for diversity, and empathy at its core. Such policies that help ensure social cohesion are essential for sustainable economic and cultural development in a multiracial society like Singapore.\nIn conclusion, having a sense of history is undoubtedly important in shaping the future of Singapore society. The past has not only shaped the core principles of the nation but also provides valuable insights to understand the intricacies and external threats that could jeopardise Singapore\u2019s stability. It serves not only as a repository of identity and remembrance, but also as guiding principles for future social, economic and political development.

Her relentless pursuance of meritocracy and multiculturalism, for instance, are the very reasons behind her economic and social achievements in a world that continues to be divided along racial and ethnic lines. They are also the reasons behind Singapore being recognised as a state that is progressive, tolerant and multicultural. A strong sense of history allows Singaporeans to recognise the importance of these values, and continue to pursue them for the betterment of the nation in the future.\nIn conclusion, Singapore\u2019s history without a doubt plays a role in shaping her future.

However, with rapid development and modernization, it is easy for these cultural aspects to be lost or forgotten. A sense of history helps Singaporeans to recognize the importance of preserving their cultural heritage for future generations. This is exemplified through initiatives such as the National Heritage Board, which aims to preserve and promote Singapore's heritage and culture through various programs and events. \n\nMoreover, a sense of history also shapes Singapore's national identity and sense of belonging. Understanding the country's past, struggles, and successes creates a shared history that brings Singaporeans together and reinforces their national identity.

This means a greater and more dominant powers (nations) privileging and imposing their ideals over others. When a minority of Hong Kongers took to the streets in the Occupy Central movement over cries of \u2018universal suffrage\u2019, U.S. President Barack Obama pronounced that the U.S. would continue to  speak up for the \u201cright of people\u201d to both protest against and change the elections process determining Hong Kong\u2019s Chief Executive. More ironically, Hong Kong\u2019s ex-British governor and other British parliamentarians mention \u2018democracy\u2019 in Hong Kong despite her citizens being deprived of any democratic electoral processes under British administration. All this is despite Hong Kong having agreed to the \u2018One Country, Two Systems\u2019 constitution, which grants them not a full, but an altered, form of democracy given her historical circumstances. The aforementioned actions by western leaders have galvanized the protestor\u2019s activism against the Chinese government in Beijing, resulting in a massive economic shutdown and violent clashes. This proves to show that cultural globalisation does have aspects which promote conflict, especially when people feel that their ideals are universal and can be replicated elsewhere. This seems to be too true, especially in relation to the earlier mentioned Arab Spring, which has later metamorphosed into an \u2018Arab Winter\u2019 of social and ethnic conflicts.\nGlobalisation and greater interconnectedness also bring economic aspects of free-market capitalism and industrialisation around the world. This has facilitated greater free-trade, increased capital flows, increased transport and communication, and the growth of multi-national companies (MNCs). One example of how these have brought more stability, less conflict, to a country once ravaged by the ills of war is South Korea. Under the leadership of third President Park Chung Hee, South Korea shifted her focus from self-sufficiency in the Syngman Rhee\u2019s administration to export-oriented industrialisation. This facilitated the rise of multinational conglomerates such as Hyundai in heavy industries and motors, and Samsung in electronics and shipbuilding. To facilitate the above operations, infrastructures and communications were improved. As a result, a once socially instable and poverty-ridden post-war South Korea transformed into a wealthy, developed and socially stable nation in a span of four decades. The \u2018Miracle on the Han River\u2019 is a testament that globalisation and greater interconnectedness have allowed nations to experience less evils, hence conflict, compared to what would have been in the past.\nOn the contrary, the same economic aspects have ironically brought scourge to other parts of the world. There was an initial belief that Congo, which holds more than 80% of the world\u2019s coltan reserves, would benefit socio-economically from the rise in demand of consumer electronics starting from the late 1990s. This is because coltan is a raw material used to produce tantalum in capacitors, a critical component in manufacturing computers and smart devices.  However, the digital revolution proved to be more of a bane than a boon. Warring rebel forces attack villages and displace families to mine and supply coltan in response to demand from MNCs. This finances their ensuing civil war. Even neighbouring Rwanda has joined in the pillaging to exploit the coltan reserves. As a consequence, more than a few million civilians have perished. This shows that when nations have weak governance and polarized societies, there are rendered unfit to best take advantage of too widespread a phenomena as globalization. In these cases, civil unrest, and conflict results.\nUltimately, our transition into an age of \u2018late-modernity\u2019 has been indubitable a multi-faceted and complex process. Globalisation and interconnectedness will likely remain an irreversible trend, but gloablisation can simultaneously bring more and less conflict. This largely depends on political, cultural, and historical climates of the geographical \u2018places\u2019 in which the related events occur. However, what remains important is that humanity continues to learn from her circumstances, and face them to construct a better age. This is through both the conflicts which globalisation has promoted in certain places such as the Middle East, Hong Kong and Congo; and the good it has done to other nations like South Korea.",

This increased awareness can help to reduce prejudice and promote greater mutual respect and understanding. For example, social media platforms allow people from different parts of the world to engage in conversations and share insights on various issues, leading to greater cross-cultural understanding.\n\nAnother positive aspect of globalisation is the growth of global governance institutions, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, which provide a forum for nations to collaborate and resolve conflicts peacefully. These institutions help to ensure that disputes are resolved through diplomacy and negotiation rather than violence. Additionally, globalisation has led to the creation of regional organizations, such as the European Union, which have played a vital role in promoting greater regional stability and cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has also resulted in the spread of democratic values and principles. As more countries adopt democratic systems of government, they become more accountable to their citizens and are less likely to engage in conflict with their neighbours. Democracies tend to be more stable, peaceful, and prosperous than authoritarian regimes, as they provide greater political stability and economic opportunities for their citizens.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has brought about some conflicts, it has also contributed to promoting greater understanding and cooperation among nations.

This has benefited consumers worldwide through the increase in world output and lower prices. However, this only works if there is stability and peace between trading nations. The 2008 Global Financial Crisis was a stark reminder that such stability cannot be taken for granted. The interconnectedness of the world\u2019s financial systems allowed a meltdown in the US sub-prime mortgage market to spread globally, triggering a worldwide economic recession. This highlights how economic interdependence, created by globalisation, can have severe consequences when the system itself is unstable. It is not difficult to imagine such instability leading to conflict between nations. The recent trade war between the US and China, though not an armed conflict, is another example of economic globalisation exacerbating tensions between two countries.\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has led to increased interconnectedness and information sharing, the effects of this are not entirely clear cut. Greater connectedness has facilitated both peace and conflict in the world, depending on the nature of the interactivity between communities and nations. While globalisation has played a positive role in allowing cultural exchange and promoting better understanding, it has also led to the spread of conflict through the misuse of technology and economic instability.

The rise of ISIS and their exploitation of media platforms to spread their message of hate is a clear example of how the increased connectivity brought on by globalisation can lead to conflict. As globalisation continues to accelerate, it is imperative that we recognise the potential for increased conflict and work towards mitigating its effects, while harnessing the positive potential for cultural and socio-economic exchange.

The fluidity of worldwide communications has permitted information to spread rapidly and offered a chance for understanding and diplomatic resolution of conflicts.

With that being said, the essence of globalisation is founded upon an openness to experience, and it is this openness to experience that offers humankind the power to overcome potential conflict.",
                "exchange and understanding. Such instances of \u2018soft power\u2019 in globalization can prevent conflict.\nHowever, much friction has also been created by economic globalisation. In the context of increased resource competition, states and nations are brought into direct competition with each other. It is thus no surprise that economic globalization has occasionally been blamed for conflict. The 1999 Seattle riots saw protesters from various nations clash with local law enforcement officers and the US National Guard, objecting to the annual World Trade Organisation (WTO) summit in the city. Developing countries are demanding greater power in global economic institutions as a call for more representation. It is hence conceivable that economic exclusion of developing states may lead to international friction, and strong governments may take recourse to militarization to keep up perceptions of their nation\u2019s strength, at the expense of other competing nations.\nYet on the flipside, economic globalisation can potentially prevent conflict. While more and more countries are pooling their resources, they are also gaining mutually beneficial cooperation networks and increasing economic interdependence. These networks can render economic sanctions or embargo counterproductive. This results in greater regional connectivity, in which independent nation-states can realise that achieving collective economic prosperity can benefit individual countries too. This interdependence has also led to increased diplomacy networks and cooperation mechanisms. An example would be the ASEAN community, in which Southeast Asian member-states are connected by cultural-socioeconomic ties and have established multilateral relationships. One can observe that economic interdependence has created proximate relationships for mutual benefit and contributed to the prevention of conflict.\nIn conclusion, while globalisation and increased interconnectedness may potentially perpetrate more conflict, it can also be used as a tool to promote collaboration, understanding and cooperation across nations. The nuances of globalisation in the political, socio-cultural and economic spheres all suggest that one should be cautious about making blanket statements, but rather remain observant and appreciative of the multifaceted nature of globalisation.",

Indeed, greater interconnectedness has allowed different communities to understand and appreciate the value of diversity, and has allowed for collaboration and exchange of ideas to address global issues such as climate change and pandemics.\nIn conclusion, while globalisation brings about greater interconnectedness worldwide, the impact of this on conflict is not straightforward. It has the potential to facilitate the spread of conflict, as seen with the rise of ISIS, but at the same time, it can also foster understanding and collaboration to prevent conflict. Ultimately, the impact of globalisation on conflict depends on how it is navigated and the extent to which stakeholders are willing to work towards common goals through dialogue, understanding and appreciation of differences.",

Greater globalisation of the world economy has been shown to reduce poverty and increase standards of living through improved access to goods and services and better paid work. Instead of a zero-sum game, economies of even proportional gain make wars less attractive to nations. As Shashi Tharoor, the former Under Secretary General of the UN argues, \"A nation that trades with another has a vested interest in mutual prosperity rather than conflict.\" On the other hand, interdependent economies can also trigger conflict when one nation\u2019s economic crisis impinges on the prosperity of many others. The 2008 global financial crisis serves as a case in point, a financial crisis originating in the United States ultimately spread around the world, leading to economic recessions in many countries including peripheral Europe.\nIn conclusion, although globalisation has undoubtedly contributed to increasing connectivity worldwide, this has not necessarily led to less conflict. As I have shown, globalisation carries both positive and negative features in the fields of political, socio-cultural and economic advancement.

While the process encourages the spread of ideas and values, some of which may lead to positive transformations, it can also provide a breeding ground for radicalisation and cultural hegemony.

                ", making it easier for people to understand and appreciate different cultures and perspectives. This can lead to greater empathy and understanding among nations, reducing the likelihood of conflict. For example, increased tourism and student exchange programs have enabled people to experience different cultures firsthand, creating more opportunities for cross-cultural understanding and dialogue.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has also led to the growth of international institutions and agreements, such as the United Nations and the World Trade Organization, aimed at promoting peace, cooperation and addressing global challenges together. These institutions have helped to establish common rules and practices that enable countries to work together more effectively and negotiate differences through peaceful means.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that globalisation has increased conflict in some aspects, it has also helped to reduce conflict and promote greater understanding among nations. To fully harness the benefits of globalisation while minimizing its downsides, it is important to recognize and address the challenges it poses while simultaneously working to build bridges among different cultures and nations. This can be done through increased dialogue, cooperation and the establishment of global institutions that foster peaceful resolution of conflicts.",

As people become more exposed to different cultures and perspectives, they can better appreciate their differences and similarities. This can lead to more peaceful interactions and a reduction in conflicts between countries.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has facilitated the growth of international organisations and institutions, such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization, which aim to promote peace and cooperation among countries. These organisations provide a forum for nations to negotiate and resolve their differences peacefully, rather than resorting to military conflict. This has led to a decline in the number of armed conflicts between countries in recent decades, compared to previous eras.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has undoubtedly increased conflict in some ways, it is not accurate to say that it has led to more conflict overall. Despite the challenges posed by economic competition and cultural clashes, globalisation has also brought about numerous benefits that have helped to promote greater cooperation and understanding among nations. As such, we should continue to embrace the positive aspects of globalisation, while working to address its negative consequences.",
                "and ideas between countries and cultures. Thanks to technology, people from around the world can connect and exchange information with ease. This has led to greater understanding and empathy between different nations, as well as increased awareness of global issues and challenges. For example, the global community has been able to work together to combat climate change, tackle poverty, and promote human rights through international cooperation.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has also led to greater economic growth and development, which can help to reduce conflict and tension. When countries are economically interdependent, they have a greater incentive to work together and avoid conflicts that may harm their economic interests. For example, the European Union was created as a means of promoting economic cooperation and reducing the likelihood of further wars in Europe.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has indeed led to conflicts and tensions in some areas, I believe that overall, it has helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding and cooperation among nations. It is important for nations and individuals to work together to mitigate the negative effects of globalisation and harness its positive potential to create a more peaceful and interconnected world.",
                "and ideas between societies, leading to greater understanding and tolerance. The spread of social media, for example, has allowed people to connect with individuals from different cultures and exchange ideas, fostering greater cultural exchange and understanding.\n\nFurthermore, globalisation has also led to greater interdependence between nations, which can act as a deterrent against conflict. As countries become more reliant on each other for trade, investment, and other economic activities, they are less likely to engage in aggressive behaviour that might disrupt these relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is true that globalisation has brought about conflicts and tensions in certain areas, it has also provided numerous benefits that have promoted greater understanding and cooperation between nations. The key challenge going forward will be to find ways to mitigate the negative aspects of globalisation while maximising its potential to reduce conflicts and promote global peace and understanding.",

This has led to more cooperation and partnerships in areas such as environmental protection, public health, and human rights. For instance, the Paris Agreement on climate change, which was signed by almost 200 countries, demonstrates how global efforts can be coordinated and mobilised to tackle a global challenge.\n\nMoreover, globalisation has also created a more interconnected world, where the well-being of one country is increasingly linked to that of others. This has incentivised countries to work together towards common goals and avoid conflict. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of global cooperation in ensuring the health and economic stability of all nations. Through sharing of scientific knowledge, medical resources, and financial aid, countries can mitigate the impact of the pandemic and emerge stronger together.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has brought about its fair share of conflicts, I believe that it has ultimately reduced tensions and promoted greater cooperation among nations. Through increased communication and interconnectedness, we can build a more inclusive and sustainable global community that benefits everyone. However, it is important that we remain vigilant towards the negative impacts of globalisation and work to address them in a constructive manner that upholds the common good.",

With the rise of social media and other forms of digital communication, people from all over the world can now easily share and exchange ideas and perspectives. This has led to a greater appreciation of diversity and more opportunities for cross-cultural collaboration, which can help to reduce conflict between different groups.\n\nAdditionally, globalisation has also led to the creation of international institutions and agreements that can help to promote peace and cooperation between nations. For example, the United Nations (UN) was established in the aftermath of World War II to promote peace and security around the world. Similarly, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and other international trade agreements can help to reduce economic tensions between countries and promote mutual benefit and cooperation.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has brought about some conflicts, overall, I believe that it has helped to reduce conflicts and promote greater understanding among nations. While there will always be disagreements and tensions between different cultures and nations, the benefits of globalisation in terms of improved communication, cooperation and peace-building should not be overlooked. The key challenge for us is to find ways to manage the negative impacts of globalisation while maximising the positive ones.",

This has led to increased cooperation on issues such as climate change, human rights, and global poverty. Additionally, the rise of international institutions such as the United Nations and World Trade Organization have created new channels for resolving disputes and promoting peaceful resolutions to conflicts.\n\nAnother way in which globalisation has reduced conflict is through economic interdependence. As nations become more reliant on each other for trade and investment, the costs of conflict become higher, making it less likely that nations will go to war or engage in aggressive behaviour towards each other. For example, the integration of European economies through the European Union has helped to create a more peaceful and stable region, with fewer instances of conflict and war.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has certainly brought about some conflicts and tensions, the overall impact on global peace and stability is more positive than negative. By increasing interconnectedness and promoting understanding between different cultures and societies, globalisation has helped to reduce the causes of conflict and created new opportunities for peaceful cooperation.",

For example, technological advancements like the internet and social media have facilitated global conversations and the sharing of knowledge and resources. This has helped to break down many of the barriers that used to separate people and cultures, and has allowed individuals to engage with others from different parts of the world in a more meaningful way.\n\nAnother way in which globalisation can reduce conflict is through the promotion of economic development and prosperity. As countries become more interconnected and participate more fully in the global economy, they often see improvements in their standards of living and overall quality of life. This can reduce the likelihood of conflict by creating conditions that are more conducive to peace and stability. Additionally, by fostering greater economic interdependence between nations, globalisation can create incentives for countries to work together to resolve disputes peacefully rather than resorting to military or other violent means.\n\nIn conclusion, while globalisation has certainly contributed to conflicts in some aspects, it is not accurate to say that it has caused more conflict overall. Despite the challenges and tensions that globalisation presents, it also offers many opportunities for increased understanding, cooperation, and peace. Ultimately, the impact of globalisation on conflict will depend on how we choose to navigate and manage the changes and challenges it presents."
