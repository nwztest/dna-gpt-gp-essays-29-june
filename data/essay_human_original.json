                "prompt": "IS COMPETITION ESSENTIAL FOR EFFECTIVE EDUCATION? DISCUSS.",
                "text": "\"Intelligence plus character- that is the true goal of education.\" This quote by Martin Luther King Jr succinctly summarizes the purpose of receiving an education. In order to push student'sboundaries and to inculcate in them values like determination and diligence, some believe that an element of competition and ranking is necessary. However, in my opinion, if competition is in excess, the education system will be rendered counter-productive due to the negative effects of encouraging hyper-competitiveness in students. Therefore, while competition is an important factor in molding people of character that will contribute to society, safeguards need to be in place to ensure that the extent of competition in the education system does not become excessive or obsessive.\nWhy is competition important? One of the key reasons is that it offers a very clear goal and motivation for students to do better at their studies. Take the Chinese education system for example. Though certain people would term it as \"extreme\", it is undeniable that China has managed to produce many bright talents especially in the area of science and mathematics due to the competition in schools. With such a large student population and a relatively tiny number of spaces in the most prestigious local universities like Beijing University, competition is a motivator for students as it pushes them to secure a bright future on their own. This is loosely based on the Darwinian idea that only the fittest survive, which encourages students to strive to be classified as the \"fittest\" and reap the rewards of being so. Therefore, it is believed that competition is necessary to bring out the best in people, and also to stretch their potential.\nMoreover, we should recognize that competition does not always mean competition with one'speers in school. It also includes competition against oneself. This is the reason that schools often have awards for \"Best Progress\" and \"Most Improved\" student. Such awards allow students to also compete with themselves and prevent them from becoming complacent. It also pushes students to continuously strive for improvement in all areas of their studies, which will ultimately help increase the overall intelligence in students and promote a sense of perseverance in them- a very important character trait in today'ssociety. Therefore, this demonstrates how competition with oneself in education is important as it emphasizes personal growth and self-improvement to achieve one'sfullest potential.\nHowever, the idea of competition in schools has met with a lot of opposition in recent years, and for good reasons too. Excessive competition can definitely be unhealthy- and there is proof of this. In Singapore, one of the most scandalous cases was a recent \"Sex-for-grades\" case where a university student gave sexual favours to a professor in order to score good grades. Many blamed the intensely competitive education system, where so much emphasis was placed on doing well in one'sstudies, that it is almost as if one'sentire life depends on grades in Singapore. Other than in Singapore, the number of teachers flagged statewide in Dallas for having sex and other inappropriate relationships with students continues to rise, according to the Texas Education Agency (TEA). In 2018, the TEA opened 429 cases into inappropriate student-educator relationships, an alarming approximate 42% increase from the prior year. Thus, it can be argued that excessive competition encourages corrupt means to do well. Students will turn to wrong and immoral methods to stay on top of the competition. Additionally, placing high stakes in examinations not only results in excessive competition, it also leads to stress. Sometimes, the pressure may be too much to handle. In Singapore, we are no strangers to the huge amounts of academic stress that can overwhelm students. Singapore had a tragic wake-up call when an 11-year-old boy fell 17 floors from his bedroom window in a deliberate act of suicide. This was because he was fearful of revealing his poor grades to his parents. Moreover, more teenagers from top schools in Singapore are reportedly seeking help at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for school-related stress. This serves as a unfortunate example illustrating how a \"pressure-cooker\" education system with far too much competition can actually overly stress students out and ruin their psychological wellbeing or even cause them to take their precious lives.\nHowever, it must also be acknowledged that not all education systems in the world require competition to function well. For example, in Finland, high-stakes standardized tests are literally a completely foreign concept. These students take only a few tests yearly, and when they do, they are mostly low-stakes. However, the quality of teaching has made Finnish students consistently near the top when it comes to international education rankings including the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). Therefore, while students are not pressurized to compete in high-stakes examinations like the Scholastic Assessment Test (SATs), they manage to perform very well because the Finnish education system focuses more on consistently learning and improving rather than one-shot measurements and ranking of student'scapabilities. This serves as proof that competition may not be necessary in the initial, pre-university stages as younger children may require more positive reinforcement to be motivated to keep learning.\nThere is more than one way to a destination. Competition can be a method to prevent complacency and laziness in students, and to serve as motivation for students to constantly better themselves. However, constant checks and reviews are definitely needed to ensure that competition does not breed corruption and underhand methods of succeeding. In addition, competition may not be necessary in every single aspect of learning as that may result in an overly stressful learning process. Instead, perhaps competition can come in at a later age, where students will be mature enough to cope with stress and the occasional defeat, which will make competition effective in shaping the character of students.

                "prompt": "DISCUSS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF SOCIAL MEDIA ACTIVISM.",
                "text": "\"Can a click make a difference in the world? By itself, probably not, but when combined with tens and even hundreds of thousands of other clicks, it may just have an impact,\" says writer Jeffrey Strain, citing the power of social media. Indeed, with the power of social media to convey a single piece of information to a multitude of people, it is increasingly being utilised for activism, serving as a catalyst for actions contributing to social change. While skeptics of social media claim that its effectiveness is undermined by the lack of need for physical participation, one cannot deny that the outreach of social media allows it to capture a massive audience (of which some will certainly be incentivised to take concrete action) making it an ideal springboard to achieve the intention of activism – to incite participation toward a certain cause. As such, I largely agree that activism done through social media is effective.\nProponents cite the propensity of social media to reach out to all individuals as the main factor for the success of social media activism. Social media allows everyone to know about social issues, whether they occur within one'scountry or across the globe – even within the comfort of their own homes. The international nature of social media also means that information of happenings around the world can transcend national boundaries and be heard and watched by individuals across the world, perhaps even before traditional forms of media like television can pick up the story. Hearing about the plight or suffering of others incites a sense of compassion in people – even more so as stories of events on social media tend to be more authentic, being first-hand accounts from laymen unedited or uncensored by corporations or governments. One individual who has harnessed social media for social change is Canadian Shawn Ahmed who travelled to Bangladesh for altruistic purposes and used YouTube as his tool. When hundreds of thousands of viewers saw his video on a Bangladeshi school that was devastated by a cyclone, many of them immediately sent money to help rebuild it. Initially, the local village only had enough funds to replace the roof of the school, but with viewer'sdonations, Ahmed was not only able to help rebuild the school, but also procure supplies for local fishermen, provide financial assistance to single mothers, as well as build a well for the village. An achievement of such a magnitude would likely be impossible without the ability to engage an audience back in North America via Twitter \"tweets\" and video logs from Bangladesh. It can therefore be seen that the power of social media to move many people and incentivise them to help out and make a difference towards a certain cause that makes social media activism highly effective, even more so as compared to traditional media like television.\nOn the other hand, detractors of social media postulate that the success of activism efforts done with the help of social media may be diminished because it brings about the problem of \"slacktivism\". \"Slacktivism\" is coined pejoratively, being a portmanteau of \"slacker\" and \"activism\", referring to measures that require minimal personal effort and have little practical effect beyond allowing people to derive satisfaction from the feeling that they have contributed. Social media gives people the ability to share information with a great many others, be it details of a certain cause, a viral video highlighting pertinent social issues, or evidence about one'sawareness about the situation – literally with a click of a button. Lamentably, this power exacerbates the \"]\"slacktivism\" problem as it makes people believe that they helped out on a social cause simply by sharing things over social media, rather than doing something practical. One pertinent example would be the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, meant to raise awareness and funds to aid those afflicted with Lou Gehrig'sdisease (which severely impairs motor activity). In the challenge, participants could choose between making a cash donation or the actual \"ice bucket\" challenge – and most opted for the latter, believing that it could make as much of a difference as a cash donation, while being more fun. In creating videos of themselves pouring iced water over their heads, people placed high value on their efforts spent and falsely perceive such an act as a substitute for more concrete action such as donating or volunteering to help out victims personally. Regrettably, social media may cause people to overrate their actions and feel that they have done tremendously to help out on certain societal causes when all they have done is post something related to the issue at hand.\nOf course, while a significant proportion of individuals are unwilling to put in concrete action towards social change, there is still a number of people who wish to do more. This is where social media serves as a first step towards greater accomplishments. With its ability to gather a sizeable target audience, in unprecedented magnitudes compared to that of television or newspapers, many more people are now aware of various social causes, which gives much more opportunities to engage people beyond mere understanding. A case in point would be that of Canadian Craig Kielburger, the founder of \"Free the Children\" (an organization that helps build schools worldwide). Out of the hundreds of thousands of people who \"liked\" the organisation'sFacebook page, only 2,000 committed to a trip overseas to help the cause. Even so, Kielburger was in praise of social media, stating that it \"opens the megaphone so much wider… when you finally look at that spectrum, we\"ve got more people who are finally making that journey\". Kielburger'sexample highlights the effectiveness of social media as a pilot for actions towards social change.\nAll in all, many cases have demonstrated the power of a single click when said click is accompanied by similar clicks from a great many other individuals. While a significant proportion of individuals passively receive and pass on information over social media, a sizeable them are willing to do more than just spread news. As such, social media has indeed attained its intention of being a catalyst of social change, whatever its scale."

                "prompt": "\"IF YOU WANT TO BE HAPPY, BE.\" DOES HAPPINESS SEEM MORE ELUSIVE IN TODAY\"S WORLD?",
                "text": "\"If you want to be happy, be.\" This statement provides us with an attractive notion which many wish to have in our daily lives. Yet, this statement portrays happiness as being easily attainable and asserts that we can be happy, as long as we have the desire to do so. However, is true happiness really that attainable in today'sworld? If it really is, then the world would be a brighter and more pleasant place, since happiness is something that most strive to attain. In today'sworld, however, in the hustle and bustle of work, with overwhelming pressure on every individual to perform, and the various problems in the financial, political and social sectors, happiness appears to elude us more than ever.\nHappiness is not easily achieved today due to our human nature of greed. By obtaining something we want, we feel happy. However, it is our nature to constantly want more, and if we do not stay satisfied with what we have, we may let greed take over. This would result in a vicious cycle of always wanting more and we will never be truly content and happy with what we have. One of the wishes people share these days is, \"To become rich and famous!\" Yet, it is not difficult to find a family where relationships have broken down because members have become more materialistic. Siblings go to court for the matter of inheritance, and people commit immoral crimes against their parents for money. Some people claim that they work hard so as to make money for the happiness of their children. They believe that the more they have, the better they can raise their children, and that the more wealth they give to their children, the happier their children'sfuture will be. However, what children really need to inherit is not wealth, but a family environment that is functioning well. Moreover, many celebrities often seem happy and satisfied in the public'seye. Yet, it is becoming more and more common to see celebrities end their lives prematurely. The Swedish DJ and producer, Avicii, was extremely popular globally, winning countless awards for his music. However, he passed away suddenly, taking his own life in 2018. This illustrates how despite the fame and money that celebrities earn, many of them are dissatisfied. In extreme cases, they even go to the extent of committing suicide. Therefore, the secret to attain happiness is to adopt an attitude of gratitude instead of greed or fame.\nAt the same time, in today'sworld, there is a high level of competition amongst countries and between individuals, which impedes on one'sability to be happy. A study carried out by Victoria Medvec, a social psychologist, showed that athletes who won bronze medals were happier with their winning than those who won silver medals. The reason is that bronze medalists were simply happy to receive honor and stand on the podium instead of having no medal, whereas silver medalists were not satisfied at the thought that they narrowly missed a gold medal. It means that they lost their joy as they compared themselves with gold medalists. Comparing oneself with someone else always makes an individual feel belittled and unhappy. This shows how the competitive nature of our society has led us to be unhappy as we only focus on what other people portray of their status, abilities and accomplishments. In a competitive society such as Singapore, where we are the most competitive nation in the world according to the World Economic Forum, citizens face increasing pressure and overwhelming amounts of stress to perform. Instead of enjoying themselves, people are rushing to meet deadlines and fighting to keep their jobs. It is therefore unsurprising that happiness takes a backseat, as stress weighs people down. Fear of underperforming is causing people to work for money instead of satisfaction. Therefore, sadly in today'shighly competitive society, citizens may not be able to live out the ideal of just being happy if they choose to do so.\nMoreover, in today'ssociety, even children are not able to enjoy their childhood. Ideally, childhood should be a carefree and happy time of enjoyment. However, in societies where academic performance is prized, schoolchildren are paying a heavy price. While Singapore has been largely successful in global education rankings, constantly ranking one of the top 5 nations globally, at the same time students in Singapore are reporting symptoms of anxiety and stress related to school as early as primary school, and there have been extreme cases where pupils have been driven to suicide. Youths often face long days at school, hours of homework, and extra classes, which are having an impact on mental wellbeing. A recent report by OECD found that overall, the nation'spupils reported higher levels of anxiety than average. In Japan, 659 Japanese aged 20 or under died by their own hand in 2019, which was an increase of 60 from the year before. In China, children as young as five are pushed hard in sporting arenas and studies. Even in Singapore, toddlers as young as eight months old are attending lessons and enrichment classes.\nAt the other end of the demographic spectrum, \"retirement\" is a word that many look forward to, where one can be happy and stress-free after a lifetime of work. However, in today'ssociety, the elderly are also not as happy as they should be. It is true that the elderly lead more comfortable lives as compared to one or two generations ago. Their children work hard to provide for them and they also are eligible for subsidies from the government. Hence, the elderly are able to spend their retirement years without having to worry much about daily necessities. Yet, in Singapore, the number of elderly people taking their own lives reached a record high in 2017. Some 129 people aged 60 and older committed suicide, despite the total number of suicides declining in the same year. Those who are sick, have little or no family or dependent help and are socially isolated may be more susceptible. This is because most would not want to be a burden to others as most adult children lead busy lives and may not be able to give as much attention to parents as the elderly need. The social interaction and emotional support they require are not there and therefore, elderly isolation has caused many elderly to feel unhappy and some are even driven to the brink of depression.\nHowever, not all hope is lost, as happiness still can be attained today due to the government'sefforts to raise the level of happiness in the country. In the recent Covid-19 outbreak, the government implemented social distancing to help Singapore cope with reducing the spread of the virus. However, social distancing has been hard on many, especially the vulnerable and the elderly. Hence, the Silver Generation Office (SGO) has deployed volunteers to help this segment of society in many ways such as picking up their groceries and accompanying them for hospital appointments. These volunteers call the elderly citizens once every week to check in on them, and these elderly often quote that it is good to have someone to chat with them. This shows that the government has done much to provide the elderly in Singapore with companionship and assistance, ensuring that their well-being is being looked after in their retirement years.\nIn the final analysis, we may face many problems in today'sworld, with rising costs of living as well as the presence of many conflicts in the world. The stress and pressure of society acting on people can result in them not being happy, and even the benefits we have today may actually be a source of sadness. However, we do have a choice, to be satisfied with what we have. Despite the problems we face, we can choose to be happy. True happiness that comes from a deep inner contentment with what we have may not be that elusive, if we choose to focus on this rather than on the externals."

                "text": "\"We have the Arts in order not to die of the truth\". This quote by Nietzsche highlights not just the importance of the Arts in providing us with a room of escape but also being a source of catharsis, and treasured for the moral and educational value it brings along with it as well as an exercise of our freedom of expression in this increasingly pluralistic world. In the past, the pursuit of the Arts was only viewed as a luxury that the rich could afford due to the need of people to devote themselves to fields that could possibly wield more assured tangible economic returns. However, as countries are becoming more affluent, developed and urbanized, the Arts have since been perceived as a more attractive and essential need in contributing to the emotional, moral and social betterment of the individuals. Since the Arts are vital in boosting the emotional and mental well-being of individuals, developing the moral stance of mankind and provoking thoughts towards social issues, I largely agree that the pursuit of the Arts is no longer an option but an integral part to the growth of the people.\nDetractors of this perspective of the Arts put forth the contention that in the face of rapid economic development, the Arts which contribute little to the financial and economic prospects of the individual may not be that critical or pertinent to people'slives of the individual. The Arts, they assert, are merely an interesting and meaningful pasture at best; a frivolous distraction from practical concerns at worst. In short, they believe that the Arts have no direct impact to the progress or relevance to the daily lives of people especially when the need for financial prospects through the conventional mode of STEM – science, technology, engineering and mathematics –are much more practical to that of individuals. The Arts, therefore, offer nothing more to them than mere entertainment in the face of economic progress. How would watching the angst and pathos of the Shakespeare'sKing Lear help put food on the table for the family? How would reveling in the splendor of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra help an accountant clinch a promotion or keep a banker from getting laid off? How would the multimillion-dollar investment of the resplendent Esplanade theatres help fend off fierce economic competition from larger economies such as China and the US? Hence, they claim that the Arts are of no concern daily lives in which they can do without.\nThis argument, unfortunately fails to depict the world in holistic terms. The Arts is critical to the alleviation of the mental and emotional stress that individuals in this increasingly affluent yet stressful world are subjected to. In truth, the Arts are necessary in promoting the emotional and psychological well-being by providing a source of escapism for individuals in enabling them to take a breather and better cope in this harsh and unforgiving society. Singapore working hours are among the longest in the developed world – 2,287 hours a year according to the Federal Reserve Economic Data website. The Arts are therefore vital in promoting the intangible aspects of human health, acting as a source of catharsis through providing a medium of unrestricted expression for people to indulge their stress in and further strike a compromise between the work-life balance among stressful workaholics in Singapore. The Arts, which takes place in many forms, ranging from art fairs, festivals, such as the recent Artbox held in Marina Bay Sands in 2017 as well as the latest high-end and acclaimed theatrical \"Les Miserables\" production in Singapore'sEsplanade theatre have attracted many from all works of life. The Arts thus also provide a temporary escape for Singaporeans to seek a relief from the hustle and bustle of society, allowing them to temporarily forget their troubles by reveling in the profundity the Arts have to offer. The Arts thus act as a source of catharsis in alleviating many of the emotional stress that Singaporeans face and thereby bettering their lives in these intangible means. Hence, this makes the pursuit of the Arts not an option but an integral part of the growth of the people in promoting the emotional wellbeing of individuals in a stressful and demanding world.\nAt the same time, the increasingly apathetic culture of men and the diminishing role of religion in many people'slives have also disrupted our moral compass. In truth, the Arts are now increasingly recognized for its soft power and ability to reach out to matters of the heart and shaping our moral beliefs and teaching us new things. The Arts have always been respected for its profundity and its ability to provoke and stimulate one in unleashing one'smoral values such as compassion, grace, forgiveness, humane, humility and so forth. For instance, the intellectually-stimulating art piece of the \"Age of Innocence\" painting which subsequently founded the novel itself does provoke thoughts among readers in defining their definition of innocence and forces them to reconsider the various aspects behind morality with that of social acceptability. In addition, new dramas such as \"Mrs Warren'sProfession\" by George Bernard Shaw written in the late Victorian period seeks to confront the traditional perceptions and attitudes towards prostitution by portraying the protagonist'smother as one who resorted to it not by choice but by circumstance, causing us to sympathize with her and acknowledging the ills of our capitalist system. The Arts is therefore an effective tool in contributing to the moralistic and ethical development of people in society and engineering strong notions of values and culture, which in some ways is also reflective of our way of life. Thus, the moral qualities that the Arts brings make it not an option but an integral part of the growth of the people in shaping one'smoral discernment.\nIn addition, the role of the Arts in our exercise of our freedom of speech in this increasingly pluralistic world is imperative in us arguing for the need of the Arts in our daily lives in expressing our right and view to things. Through the ability to exercise our freedom of speech we are able to bring about new changes in improving the lives of others. The Arts, which can take place in different forms such as government feedback channels like the \"Daily Talks\" which flames Trump and his policies or even citizenry platforms such as REACH forums in Singapore allows for greater participation in society which promotes a more inclusive and integrated society in fostering stronger national bonds and unity among fellow citizens. These channels of the Arts or even in local films such as \"Ah Boys to Men\" by renowned local producer Jack Neo also seeks to express his personal thoughts of what every Singaporean man will have to experience in National Service, which is vital in reinforcing the cultural identity and national belonging to one'snative country and calls for society with greater social cohesion in it. Yet, while the Arts allow for the freedom of expression, it should be recognized that this should be conducted along with personal discretion in promoting social cohesion. In the established reporting of the Charlie Hebdo incident, the social satirical magazine that mocked the prophet Mohammad experienced severe backlash for its inappropriateness and insensitivity to Islam. Hence, the Arts while on the pretext of preserving and enabling freedom of expression should also be closely regulated in order to not endanger social cohesion and promote internal strife. Thus, the room for freedom of expression, if carefully regulated, makes the pursuit of the arts not an option but an integral part in the growth of the people.\nSince time immemorial, the Arts have always been regarded as one that was secondary to that of meeting the basic needs as iterated under Maslow'shierarchy of needs. However, in an increasingly affluent and stressful world, the need for the Arts has become vital and important among people across the world due to the benefits bestowed upon the emotional, moral and the sense of national belonging in an individual."

                "prompt": "ARE PEOPLE MORE WILLING TO MAKE SACRIFICES TODAY?",
                "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \"As my sufferings mounted, I soon realized that there were two ways in which I could respond to my situation — either to react with bitterness or seek to transform the suffering into a creative force. I decided to follow the latter course.\" Easier said than done, the path to seek a transformation of suffering is a laborious one, which sometimes necessitates sacrifices. That being said, it seems like there are people who are willing to make sacrifices for their causes. Cynics may argue that some people are willing to make sacrifices to gain fame and fortune, and not for the selfless pursuit of promoting their causes. However, I am of the opinion that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today because of the significance of celebrity culture, higher expectations that people have in their governments today and feelings of unfairness if they are not entitled to merit goods or benefits provided by other countries.\nSome people claim that they are more than willing to make sacrifices for their causes. These people show others their determination in championing for their causes by making \"sacrifices\". However, these sacrifices could be done – sadly, in pretence to gain fame and fortune, and not for causes that these people claimed to promote. An apt example to illustrate this point is Somaly Mam, a Cambodian anti-trafficking advocate campaigning against trafficking of young girls for commercial sex. After Mam'scompelling story of being \"abused, trafficked and traumatized as a sex slave\" was made into a Hollywood movie, she turned into an international celebrity – setting up the Somaly Mam Foundation, raised money, appeared on major television programs, and spoke at many international events. Mam was known for her willingness to sacrifice her family'ssecurity to champion her cause for anti-human trafficking – as shown from her claims that her daughter was kidnapped by human traffickers in retaliation for her work with victims of the sex trade. However, journalists recently learnt that she had fabricated much of her life story that had been used to raise millions of dollars in the Somaly Mam Foundation for over a decade, allowing her to lead a life of fame and power. Not only did Mam illustrate her unwillingness in making sacrifices for her cause, it also shows how causes can be exploited for material gains. Even if some are willing to make sacrifices, these \"sacrifices\" may be done in the selfish pursuit of fame and fortune, or perhaps, merely attention.\nHowever, I am of the view that most people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today because even celebrities are tapping on their popularity to propagate their causes. Coupled with the advent of social media platforms enhancing communication between celebrities and fans, the significance of the impact that celebrities have on their fans in championing their causes is undeniable. In the recent Black Lives Matter campaign, which protests against incidents of police brutality against African-American people, many celebrities have publicly spoken out to garner support for the movement. An example to illustrate this would be John Boyega, who is a well-known Star Wars actor. Boyega gave a powerful speech at a Black Lives Matter rally in London, urging his fellow demonstrators to press on and continue fighting to end racism against African-American people. Countless celebrities have also taken to their social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter, to speak up against police brutality towards Black people. Many have even provided resources online for their followers and fans to access, so as to better educate themselves on the matter. Some celebrities such as Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds even made a $200,000 donation to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund upon hearing of Georg Floyd, a black man'smurder by policemen. Therefore, this demonstrates how celebrities are able to tap on their popularity and large fanbase to make a difference in inspiring change in society. Therefore, it is justifiable to claim that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today as seen by the acts of certain celebrities.\nFurthermore, the higher expectations that people have in ruling governments today have resulted in uprisings and protests – done with the aim to propagate social causes. The use of social media platforms to spread political beliefs has seen the overthrow of two presidents, Hosni Murbarak and Morsi from the Egyptian government since the Arab Spring. Hence, the power of social media in championing social causes is undeniable which has led to people becoming more willing to sacrifice their lives for their causes because their sacrifices are now, at the very least, seen by the public eye. Another example would be the demonstrations that begin in Ecuador in 2019. When the government announced that it was taking public spending cuts agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), this change led to a sharp rise in petrol prices, which many said they could not afford. Indigenous groups feared that the measure would result in increased costs for public transport and food, and that their rural communities would be hardest hit. Protesters blocked highways, stormed parliament and clashed with security forces as they demanded an end to austerity and the return of fuel subsidies. The government backed down after days of mass protests and the action came to an end. From these examples, it is clear that rising expectations that people have in ruling governments have led to increased willingness among people to make sacrifices for their causes today.\nMoreover, I agree with the view that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today because they are subjected to feelings of unjust given that they may not be entitled to certain benefits or merit goods in the country. These feelings of unfairness are further exacerbated when governments of other countries are able to provide the citizens with what they want and need, thus leading to a higher quality of life. An example to illustrate this is Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani school pupil and education activist, who is known for her activism for rights to education and for women, especially in the Swat Valley, where the Taliban had at times banned girls from attending school. Despite an assassination attempt to kill Yousafzai and her father by the Taliban, she continues to advocate for rights of women to education, and even spoke at the United Nations to call for worldwide access to education. Yousafzai'ssacrifice of her safety – _as shown by how the Taliban attempted to assassinate her – enabled her to further her cause to promote education for women. It was done with the aim to eradicate violation of women'sright, where a lack of provision of education to women has resulted in the unfair and inhumane treatment towards women. Another person who has made sacrifices to stand up strongly for what she believes in is 17-year-old Greta Thunberg. Thunberg began a global movement by skipping school: starting in August 2018, she spent her days camped out in front of the Swedish Parliament, holding a sign painted in black letters on a white background that read: \"School Strike for Climate Change\". In the time since, she has addressed heads of state at the U.N., met with the Pope, sparred with the President of the United States and inspired 4 million people to join the global climate strike on September 20, 2019, in what was the largest climate demonstration in human history. This shows the strength in Thunberg'sbelief in environmental preservation, and how she truly believes that change must happen in the world, such that she is willing to make sacrifices to inspire people to share her vision. Therefore, feelings of unjust have resulted in activists such as Malala being willing in making sacrifices which they deem to be for a worthy cause.\nIn essence, while some people may argue that people today make sacrifices because of ulterior motives that they may have such as gaining international popularity and not to simply promote their causes, my stand is that people today are more willing to make sacrifices because of a genuine need to promote their causes. The influence of celebrity culture, rising expectations of ruling governments and feelings of unfairness felt by people would further enhance their willingness to effect societal change. Therefore, it is justifiable to argue that people are more willing to make sacrifices for their causes today."

                "prompt": "DISCUSS WHETHER THE WORLD WOULD BE BETTER OFF IF EVERYONE SPOKE THE SAME LANGUAGE?",
                "text": "Language is the primary means through which we communicate and express ourselves. Given that Man is a social creature and his growth and progress is dependent on his interactions with others, language does play a vital role in helping to shape his thoughts and ideas. Some may argue that with a common language, humans would be united in the ability to relate and communicate more effectively, ultimately eliminating communication barriers. However, having a common language may not help to make the world a better place. I personally believe that a common language would do more harm than good in today'ssociety.  Instead, we should work together to accept, embrace and appreciate the diversity of languages we have today.\nAcross the world, language is a key feature that separates cultures and groups of people. It is also used to distinguish between different eras. In this sense, language helps to promote diversity and encourages people to embrace their own cultures. In China, although Mandarin is the common language between various ethnic groups, there are about forty-five different dialects still spoken, each representing a different ethnic group with their individual customs and traditions. If everyone spoke the same language, it would not promote diversity and this would lead to a decline in creativity and colour in society. Studies have shown that different backgrounds and cultures do shape a person'soutlook, all of which help to make a person more creative. Thus, there is value in preserving such an integral part of an individual'sidentity. Through diversity, we also learn to become more understanding and accepting of differences between people. In Singapore, the four main races that make up the population, namely the Chinese, Malays, Indians and Eurasians, coexist in harmony and there is easy intermingling between them. A unique trait of Singapore would be its colloquial language termed as \"Singlish\", in which English words are mixed with terms from Malay, Mandarin, Chinese dialects and Tamil creating a creole that is truly distinctive to the country. Many Singaporeans often cite that Singlish creates a shared identity amongst Singaporeans and that it gives them a sense of belonging to the nation. This shows that communication is not limited to a single language and having multiple languages can still benefit people. In recent years, linguists even draw on dialogues used in local Singaporean productions to introduce to undergraduates and postgraduate students how Singlish has become a unique variety of the English language. In countries such as Italy, Germany and Japan, at least seven universities around the world have used Singlish as a case study in linguistics courses over the past decade. This shows that there is much to learn from the diversity of languages in society. Thus, the world would benefit from having the diversity brought about by speaking various languages, rather than just a single language.\nContrary to popular belief, having a single language spoken by everyone would also not help to reduce the prejudices and discrimination against others. Humans rely heavily on their senses and most stereotypes and judgements have no logical bearing. These are usually dependent on what one considers \"normal\" relative to one'sown background and understanding of the world around him or her. One'scharacter and upbringing also plays a huge role in determining how one views the differences in languages around him. As such, differences in the way people look, act and talk all contribute towards how we discriminate against people. In more extreme cases, the Rohingya crisis is a sad example of how people are discriminated against purely because of their language and background. In August 2017, a deadly crackdown by Myanmar'sarmy on Rohingya Muslims sent hundreds of thousands fleeing across the border into Bangladesh. The United Nations has described this as a \"textbook example of ethnic cleansing\" and ordered the Buddhist-majority country to take measures to protect members of its Rohingya community from genocide. At least 6,700 Rohingya were killed in the month after the violence broke out, and as of today, more than 700,000 Rohingya have fled the country and tens of thousands have been killed. From this example, we can clearly see how despite the similarities people may share, such as living in the same country and even similarities in their languages, other differences such as ethnicity can result in massive conflicts which bring about much pain and suffering. This illustrates how speaking the same language does not necessarily leave the world better off as hoped for.\nYet, it cannot be denied that there are advantages to everyone speaking the same language. Having a common language would eliminate the communication barriers that exist between people. Despite the fact that there are many races and ethnicities of people living within Singapore, with each having their own unique language, English remains a common language that unites everyone. This enables the population, especially those born in later generations, to communicate and interact with one another with ease. This has resulted in numerous benefits for society as people are able to come together to make positive changes. Research programmes in tertiary institutes have had teams make breakthrough discoveries in areas such as stem cell research and bioengineering. This would have been much more challenging to accomplish if language barriers existed between members of the teams. This shows the important role that a common language can play as a fundamental tool for effective communication and how it could make the world better off.\nAll in all, I believe that a common language does not necessarily lead to the world being a better place if the collective aim of everyone is not to benefit humanity. It has been asked, \"If we were blind and had no choice, would we still hate each other by the tone of our voice?\" This aptly describes how, in spite of a common language, discrimination and prejudice will exist in society unless we make a conscious effort to accept people for who they are. Language can help to make us more accepting, but how we chose to wield it is another matter."

                "prompt": "IS THIS PACE OF LIFE IN YOUR SOCIETY TOO FAST FOR ITS OWN GOOD?",
                "text": "Given the rapid advancement of technological progress across the globe in this day and age, it is unsurprising that modern Singapore constantly vies to be at the head of the world'stechnological frontier. The importance of staying up-to-date and relevant in this interconnected world cannot be emphasised further against the backdrop of economic development. Hence, efficiency and productivity have unequivocally become the focus of Singaporean society today. In light of this, it is necessary that we take a step back to review if such direction for Singapore has led to a pace of life too fast for its own good. While it is true that increased efficiency has allowed us to reap the fruits of stellar economic growth, I believe that the pace of life in Singapore is indeed too fast for its own good, considering the ramifications it has on the graciousness, health and stress levels of its people.\nSome claim that the pace of life in Singapore is ideal, and not too fast because the increased emphasis on efficiency has produced desirable economic results for our society over the years. Since the dawn of its time, the Singapore government has consistently invested in and implemented strategies to ensure greater efficiency in our production processes, seeking to increase the productivity of its workers and purchase more advanced machinery to facilitate increased output. Such tactics have produced results, as evidenced by Singapore'sclaim to being the country with one of the highest Gross Domestic Product per capita in the world. The affluence enjoyed by many and most Singaporeans is further illustrated by the high material living standards of households everywhere, owing to increased household incomes over the years. Hence, the current pace of life is arguably not too fast, as it has undeniably benefitted Singaporeans in the areas of higher remuneration and greater ability to buy comfort.\nMoreover, some argue that Singapore cannot afford to slow down its pace of life, due to the increasingly interconnected nature of today'sglobal society. Against the backdrop of rapid economic development all across the globe, to slow down would mean to risk being left behind in the wave of globalisation sweeping countries everywhere. This is especially so due to our dearth of natural resources and raw materials, the lack of hinterland, as well as the small population size, all of which render Singapore disadvantaged since it is unequipped with key resources that many other countries are naturally endowed with. Recently, the government announced that it would set aside fellowships worth $10,000 for each senior worker, to help them gain mastery in their respective fields and attain the necessary qualifications to teach others. This illustrates the shift towards sustaining the employability of older workers and maximising the potential of Singapore'slimited pool of human resources. Efforts to compensate for this lack of resources also include acquiring new skills, technology, and knowledge from other countries so as to boost Singapore'scompetitive edge. As multinational corporations and businesses invest where they find attractive prospects and high profits, it is hence necessary for Singapore to maintain its fast pace of life, which allows it to obtain considerable standing in the globalised world and remain lucrative.\nHowever, it is too narrow to adopt this point of view, in light of the significant negative impacts that a fast pace of life has on Singaporeans social relationships, which are arguably equally, if not more important than the economic sphere of our lives. Late 20th century inventions such as instant messaging and video calls have shaped the habits and tendencies of today'syouths and adults, as people become accustomed to the fact that their friends and loved ones are merely a text message or a phone call away, and they often find themselves spending more time with others via electronic devices as opposed to having face-to-face conversation. As Whatsapp and other forms of messaging continue to thrive, many resign to conversing over text rather than making the effort to meet up in person over dinner, or a cup of coffee. Such habits have irrevocably affected our relationships with others and are reflected in the behaviours of our children. It is not uncommon to see quiet, desolate playgrounds in Singapore nowadays, for many children prefer to retire to the comfort of playing with an iPad in an air-conditioned room indoors. Even on public transport, the ever-familiar sight of commuters with earphones plugged in and staring at a glaring smartphone screen never fails to greet passengers daily. Evidently, the fast pace of life has compromised on flourishing social relationships and promoted a society of hermits instead.\nFurthermore, the negative impacts that a fast pace of life has on our mental and physical health are far from negligible. Owing largely to the increased usage of devices and time spent looking at monitors, Singapore sees an outrageously high rate of myopia; we hold the unfortunate title of being world number 1 for the prevalence of myopia in seven to nine-year-olds. Additionally, the rise in the number of fast-food outlets in Singapore such as the popular McDonald'sor Burger King is indubitably a result of Singaporean'sgreater desire for a quick and efficient meal as they hurry to get back to work. These days, many see meals simply as a necessary chore to replenish their energy, rather than something that should be leisurely enjoyed. Such an unhealthy diet contributes to the 1.7 million people in Singapore at risk of obesity-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, and especially in explaining the dramatic rise in the number of children with Type 2 diabetes in recent years. Hence, it is evident that a fast pace of life has worsened the physical health of Singaporeans in more than one aspect. Moreover, the intense work culture is a key factor in explaining the reduced time spent on recreation or leisure activities, causing high-stress levels. People hardly give themselves sufficient time to rest and relax, trying their best to meet exorbitant workloads. According to the Institute of Mental Health, Singapore has seen large increases in cases of depression and anxiety in youths and young adults. Therefore, the decline in health levels of Singaporeans stands as strong evidence for the stand that the pace of life is indeed too fast in Singapore.\nTo end, although I acknowledge that their benefits reaped from economic progress is significant and desirable to all, the ramifications with which a fast pace of life brings to Singaporeans are severe and deep-rooted in their impact. Since Singapore is currently enjoying stable economic growth and progress, I propose that the government take more measures to ensure that the pace of life in Singapore is not too fast in order to prevent trends of declining, increasing stress levels, and ungraciousness are stemmed in the long run. Having said that, one must seek to achieve a balance between tangible and intangible comforts – in order to achieve, individuals should also seek to review their priorities and adjust their respective pace of life accordingly so as to ensure that it is not too fast and to the detriment of our overall well-being."

                "prompt": "DO AWARDS AND PRIZES SERVE ANY USEFUL PURPOSE?",
                "text": "\"Keep your eyes on the prize.\" A common saying we grow up with which guides us through the achievement-seeking process up to the point we are rewarded for our efforts. From winning the Nobel Prize to getting first in a subject in school; be it an international or in a small local competition, prizes and awards are a common tool used for rewarding and according to a certain level of achievement to someone today. Prizes and awards are used to recognise an individual or groups excellence in various fields, and allow them to feel a sense of achievement, and be seen for what they have accomplished. I believe that prizes and awards are useful in recognising outstanding people, and crediting them for their achievements. Additionally, prizes and awards further motivate people to work hard toward achievement, prizes and awards inspire, they motivate people to strive for excellence. Yet we must also recognize that conversely, an over-valuation of awards and prizes might diminish their positive impacts and create a rather materialistic society that only has their \"eyes on the prize\".\nPrizes and awards offer rewards to individuals and groups who work hard, helping them find motivation to continue striving in their respective fields. It rewards deserving people in both environmental and scientific fields, and much more, they allow for further exploration in research to better society. Prestigious scientific awards such as the Nobel Prize offer a cash award of 1.5 million dollars to the laureates, though its influence is worth more than prize money. Usually, scientists which are accorded Nobel Prizes go down in history as legends to be remembered, and their work as a result becomes incredibly widespread and furthered, even the laureates themselves become household names almost. Most people you ask would have heard of Albert Einstein and his Theory of Relativity, on which most of modern Science is built upon. He won the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921, and his work has inspired many of modern-day science'sdiscoveries. Gary Becker, who won the 1992 Nobel Prize said his lectures were solicited more, his opinions were more valued and the prize helped boost funding for his area of study due to its prestige. Furthermore, prizes and awards are effective in incentivising students to complete and further their studies. Cash prizes such as Edusave and Scholarship awards – given to top students in Junior Colleges and Secondary Schools in Singapore – are both motivational and practical, providing subsidies toward the educational costs of students who do well, reducing the burden on their families to provide for their education, especially at higher levels. This recognition allows outstanding people to be motivated and continue working hard, thus creating a society in which every individual strives to excel in order to obtain rewards they wish to attain.\nPrizes and awards are also useful in glorifying the achievements of the deserving, and in the process inspiring and motivating others to follow in their footsteps. In the entertainment and sports world, prizes and awards are a great fuel to an individual'spassion and their resultant hard work. For many, if they receive awards, not only are they put in the spotlight, but the hard work they put in to achieve what they did is thoroughly recognised. When Michael Phelps achieved the award of having the most number of gold medals in the history of the Olympics, he became both a legend and an icon. He could immediately retire as a result, travel the world, and still make money to lead a comfortable life with his title of most prized Olympian. Similarly, Usain Bolt's100-metre record made him the target of the advertising teams of most successful sports brands and led to the creation of a line of sport shoes attached to his name. His signature \"lightning\" pose became a highly impersonated pose by athletes around the world and he continues to inspire many others with his talent and personality. Prizes and awards are thus useful in helping artists and athletes boost their outreach and their careers away from their sports and their main lines of work. They allow athletes to establish fan bases, providing them with the validation and recognition they need. Prize and award ceremonies are also commonly screened live with millions of viewers watching, allowing them to have a great impact on not only the celebrities and athletes but their audience as well.\nHowever, prizes and awards may also in turn create a materialistic society in which the prizes and awards are sought instead of the achievement and recognition that come from them. Individuals might as a result only be willing to contribute to society for something in return, and may even resort to underhanded means to achieve what they want, opening prize and award systems to abuse. According to a 2008 scientific record, published retractions in scientific journals have increased around 1,200% over the past decade, even though the number of published papers has gone up by only 44%. Around half of these retractions are suspected cases of misconduct. Furthermore, scientists may only focus on populist domains in which there are prizes to be won, instead of domains of research that might benefit minority communities greatly, or even hidden discoveries that may benefit society greatly. Similarly, sportsmen may lose sight of the true meaning of sportsmanship in the pursuit of these awards. Lance Armstrong, a former legend was stripped of his seven Tour de France titles after being found guilty of using steroids to improve his performance during the races. Excessive competition and emphasis of prizes and awards might result in individuals disregarding things achievements that might not come with rewards, causing society to evolve into one that is only individualistic, and focused on material self-interests.\nAs Jake Colsen once said, \"The ones who win usually don\"t need a prize.\" Though prizes and awards are undoubtedly valued in our society, it is important more so for us to be able to see beyond these material accolades of our achievements. Our identities should be continuously shaped and defined not only by our material achievements but our values as well. That is, keeping our eyes beyond the prize, instead of merely on it."

                "prompt": "IS COURAGE NECESSARILY A VIRTUE?",
                "text": "Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \"Courage is an inner resolution to go forward despite obstacles; Cowardice is submissive surrender to circumstances.\" Courage is innate, and can be found in all of us, whether or not we choose to display it. It can even be said to occasionally be an instinctive effort – a response in the face of danger. However, from the deduction that courage is a natural human trait, courage can be mad too, as it is exacted by those who engage in moments of folly or suppressed lunacy. Cynics assert that when courage is exacted by a self-centred person or a madman, the effects of these courageous acts may vary greatly, with a tendency to be negative. How then can courage be completely viewed as a virtue? Virtues by definition are amorphous good things, blessings unto society and humanity as a whole. Personally, I believe that courage is most virtuous when it is combined with knowledge, wisdom and opinion. Hence, I agree that courage is a virtue only when we choose to do good, especially when it is most difficult.\nPositively, courage can be a virtue in the form of physical courage, whereby it is a response to external threats. It can be a proactive choice or decision undertaken for the preservation of one'srights and way of life. Definitely, courage in this sense presents advantageous situations, such as the physical bravery shown during wartime. For example, during World War II, a French resistance group, the \"Marquis\", rose in the midst of ceaseless warfare and provided shelter and sanctuary to the British pilots who were shot down over France by the aggressive German Air Force, the Luftwaffe. In the ravages of war, the members of \"Marquis\" took a convicted stance against Hitler'sthreat of worldwide domination, refusing to subvert themselves to the German'smachinations. Their courage in the engagement of such an infinitely dangerous mission is indeed admirable, and encouraged other resistance movements to rise up during WWII, uniting the people as a powerful cohesive force against external aggression. As Marianne Williamson observed, \"As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.\" This is the evident achievement of their physical exhibition of courage, as courage in this instance is definitely, without questionable doubt, a virtue that empowers others.\nCourage can also be seen as a virtue in the quest for individual identity: to be different and break free from the restraints of a conformist society. Such idealism is indeed a shining positivity in a stark world – an example of this individualistic courage is in the model of Vincent Van Gogh, the world-renowned painter of pieces-de-resistance such as \"Sunflowers\" and \"Starry Night\". He was an idealist and an innovator in his own right, willing to challenge even the conventions of art in his ceaseless quest for self-expression and self-fulfilment. Pablo Picasso also exhibited this version of courage, shedding light on the abstract art scene in Paris, and ushering in a new era for the fine arts through his constant breaking of barriers and opposition toward artistic conventions. These two artists are famous globally, and the singular differentiating aspect that set them apart from other artistic talents was their courage, as they were largely misunderstood by others during their lifetimes. However, their courage to be different indubitably changed the course of the evolution of art forever, and now their works are priceless and considered by the curators of fine art to be nearly sacrosanct. Their courage to dream, and realise their dreams, once again empowers global society, as they were pioneers to dream the impossible, convention-challenging dreams. Indeed, their courage is a virtue that inspires and stimulates our imagination.\nCourage may also manifest as moral courage, and is virtuous in fighting for change, choosing to risk embarrassment rather than tolerate injustice. One such example is that of Mother Teresa, of whom virtue was an integral part of her existence, as it was inborn and ingrained in her being. She renounced all worldly pleasures she might have possessed and rendered herself destitute, courageously caring for the aged and young in Calcutta, in a stunning display of self-sacrifice. After all, a virtue is a trait that is meant to be advantageous to people – Mother Teresa'scourage and virtue widened the circles of compassion of an infinite number of individuals all over the world. Another individual who exemplifies courage is Martin Luther King Jr., who was the leader in the civil rights movement from 1955 until his assasination. He advanced civil rights through nonviolence, inspired by his Christian beliefs and nonviolent activism of Mahatma Gandhi. However, apart from his deep religious and moral beliefs, less appreciated and acknowledged is the courage of his convictions. King was nearly killed when he was stabbed by an assailant while on a book tour, and was arrested numerous times as he led marches and other demonstrations. He lived a great deal of his life in the face of ugly crowds, yet, King'sbeliefs and courage prevailed. It must be acknowledged that he was human, flawed and no doubt he was scared. However, his humanity never overcame his commitment to a higher purpose and in his own brave, nonviolent way, he showed courage. King'scourage gave others strength, and inspired many others to have the same goal of ending racial injustice. Therefore, this shows how moral courage can be expressed to end injustice, and is undoubtedly virtuous in fighting for positive change in society.\nHowever, we must also recognize that courage may not always be virtuous – it may bring about devastating consequences like the imposition on people'slives, destitution and military aggression. As seen in Adolf Hitler'sExpansionist Policy in WWII to set up his ideal world, he singlehandedly orchestrated the deaths of six million Jews during the Holocaust in the pursuit of his vision. His power was absolute and unchallenged, and showed courage and fierce determination in executing his plans. He was convicted in his desire for absolute power, even resorting to underhanded means for political ascension – he and his Gestapo (the German secret police) burnt down the Reichstag in order for Hitler to initiate a state of Emergency and seize both the power of the Chancellor and the President and install himself as the absolute dictator, the Fuhrer. It took courage for Hitler to pursue this dream for absolute dominion so relentlessly, especially in the face of such mounting global opposition and adversity. Despite the threat of military aggression against his country and the ultimate threat of a world war, he remained resolute. However, such a dream as he wished to be fulfilled was tainted and distorted, and as the saying goes, \"power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely\". In this instance, his courage was abused and brought unimaginable pain and suffering to vast numbers of people – such courage can never, in any sense, be considered virtuous.\nSimilarly, courage should not be regarded as a virtue when such courage is utilised to pursue what one thinks is the right course of action against general consensus and the greater good of all. Courage in this sense can be made manifest in one man'sassumed delusional struggle against the broader concerns of society, a self-initiated renegade cause that brings destruction and uncertainty in its wake. Such an example is of the parallels of both Doctor Stockmann from the play, \"Enemy of the People\", by Henrik Ibsen, and the true story of Erin Brockovich. In both cases, both Brockovich and Stockmann discovered discrepancies in the water supply that led them to deduce, with conviction, that the water sources were poisoned. Hence, they sought to challenge the authorities, albeit with insufficient evidence, compromising and jeopardising the livelihoods of many of whom had jobs dependent on the water supply and its management. Despite the evident repercussions their perception of the truth might have imposed on the innocents, they nevertheless went ahead with their quest for supposed justice, disregarding the injustice that they would exact on the people. Hence, in this sense, courage is seen as an instrument of a selfish quest for a personal belief, rather than an expression of a noble virtue.\nOscar Wilde quipped, \"Society does not exist, it is a mere concept. The real world consists of only individuals.\" This statement can be seen as true when we realize that there is no realistic standardisation and no coagulation of the separate individuals of society into one condensed body. Since courage is an instrument exacted and controlled by the individual, the perception of courage and the effects of courageous acts are bound to vary greatly as the individual lends a portion of his multi-dimensional character to the expression of courage. Hence there can be no clear-cut designation of courage as a pure virtue, as it does not exist in mono-dimensions. Courage can be positive, bestowing blessings upon others, and can be a virtue, or it can be a curse – depending on what objectives it lends itself to."

                "prompt": "DO YOU AGREE THAT READING NOVELS IS A WASTE OF TIME?",
                "text": "Virginia Woolf once said: \"Fiction is like a spider'sweb, attached ever so lightly perhaps, but still attached to life at all four corners.\" People often look down on fictional stories because they are not anchored in reality and therefore argue that they are of no value in the \"real world\". Although novels may be anchored in alternate realities, at their core, they have many valuable lessons to be learnt. These values apply to our character, how we interact and the way we work. Hence, as an avid book-lover myself, I personally strongly disagree that reading novels is a waste of time.\nOne obvious reason why novels are not merely a way of passing time is because of the literary quality of many novels which serve as an inspiration to its readers. Although they are fictional, many novels are literary works of art. Just as aspiring artists get inspired by the technique of renowned artists like Leonardo DaVinci, students and even fellow writers can get different perspectives of storytelling methods by reading novels. It is no secret that the best fictional works of our time have been inspired by past works of fiction. A famous example would be how Charles Dickens, a British novelist who wrote such beloved classic novels such as \"Oliver Twist\" and \"A Christmas Carol\", drew inspiration from poet William Shakespeare, who was widely regarded as the greatest writer in the English language. While this may have been a long time ago, writers being influenced by other writers and poets can also be observed in recent years. George R. R. Martin, author of critically-acclaimed \"A Song of Fire And Ice\" book series drew inspiration from authors like J. R. R. Tolkien who wrote the even more renowned \"Lord of the Rings\" trilogy. Novels are intricately woven tapestries of language; therefore people can learn from them and be motivated to create their own literary works. As such, one can view the reading of novels as a crucial part of the creative process as they are a major source of inspiration. Therefore, they are also a contributing factor to the diversity of literature today.\nReaders who enjoy novels will inevitably enrich their vocabulary as well as gain knowledge and understanding of certain world issues. Some novels are written based on historical events, which can help the reader obtain knowledge on certain past events. Such readings would supply the reader valuable information and aid their understanding for other studies such as history, politics, economics, sociology and psychology. A notable example would be the novel \"Animal Farm\", which reflects the events leading up to the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the Stalinist era of the Soviet Union. This would allow readers to draw parallels between the characters in the novel and historical figures, aiding them in their understanding of historical events that shape the world today. Apart from learning about factual events that were depicted in novels, works of fiction also reflect modern day struggles such as racism, which still plagues our world today. Books such as \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" by Harper Lee and \"The Hate U Give\" by Angie Thomas take up issues of racial injustice and identity, both of which resonate with many students in particular – and are particularly timely in the wake of countless police shootings of unarmed black men and women today. The novel \"To Kill A Mockingbird\" is a perennial reading assignment for many American students, deemed as a fixture in American consciousness for many decades due to its examination of racial injustice. This shows how novels are able to both educate students on the struggles faced by certain segments of society, as well as to model for students how they can stand up and speak out against injustice. This would undoubtedly improve one'ssocial skills in terms of how they empathise and how they relate to other individuals. Hence, this shows how works of fiction still hold an important place in society, in addressing pertinent issues in the world and empowering individuals to eradicate these problems.\nIn addition, a commonly cited reason that parents encourage children to read from a young age is that reading novels improves creativity. By reading more books, children would be able to expose themselves to new and more information. This would develop creativity in children, allowing them to come up with more innovative ideas. Through the interesting characters as well as creative story plots that are woven together intrinsically by authors, this develops a child'sability to think imaginatively. As compared to spending time playing video games and surfing the Internet, reading books is an activity that forces the reader to ditch distractions and focus. It is this said focus that acts as a catalyst for an increase in creativity. This is because books are a window to the world – allowing a glimpse into cultures past, present and future, as interpreted by their authors and filtered through our own imaginations. Children who read novels from a young age would be able to discover an amazing amount of information, especially at a young age when they are more impressionable. The more children know, the more they will be able to share, ultimately shaping them to become better conversationalists, quicker thinkers and better problem solvers in the future.\nHowever, just as with all things, novels do have a negative side to them that hold no value in bettering one'slife. In order for us to reap the benefits of reading novels, we as readers need to be selective in what we choose to read. There are close to 130 million books in the world, and it would be naive to assume that all novels hold an equal value to an individual. While there are novels that stimulate one'sintellect and improve creativity, there also exist novels that encourage morally unsound values. An example would be the genre of erotic novels. Novels such as \"Twilight\" by Stephenie Meyer, or E. L. Jame's\"Fifty Shades of Grey\" certainly would not hold any value in bettering one'slife. This is because these books do not focus on inculcating the right values in its readers, but instead promote the culture of pre-marital sex, which may not coincide with the values that readers have been taught. Hence, one would probably not gain any of the abovementioned benefits if one chooses to read books that are of no significant value.Thus, one can see that rather than generalize whether novels are a waste of time, it is far better to scrutinize each novel individually. Some novels tend to have more educational value; others, moral value, and it is up to readers to be discerning and seek out books of quality, not just chick-lit romance novels that teach us little and can be justified as \"a waste of time\" as the question suggests.. This way, we will be able to reap the most benefits from reading novels."

                "prompt": "\"A SCHOOL SHOULD NOT ONLY TEACH KNOWLEDGE, BUT VALUES AS WELL.\" DISCUSS.",
                "text": "C.S. Lewis once said, \"Knowledge without values seems rather to make a man a more clever devil.\" While the primary goal of educational institutes is to ensure that all students are equipped with the knowledge required by the workforce or to move on to higher education, I believe that schools must also teach values. This complements their learning of contextual knowledge and gives students a more holistic education that covers emotional development as well. I strongly believe, therefore, that inculcating values in students at school should be taught alongside knowledge in schools.\nTo begin with, without a proper \"moral compass\" or guide to conducting oneself, knowledge is rendered meaningless in making decisions. As seen from the quote above, without any values, we are simply making children more susceptible to forging values that go against what is considered respectable in society. With the increasing plethora of knowledge so easily available to students, this gives everyone equal opportunities to educate themselves, hence creating a level playing field for the absorption of knowledge. However, this does not guarantee that the knowledge will be used wisely, as students with vast amounts of knowledge may not hold sound moral beliefs, and may also negatively influence others around them. Given that students across the globe spend a sizable portion of their day in school, schools should be responsible for teaching their students values as well. A classroom will comprise students of various backgrounds and beliefs and the onus is on the schools to ensure that their students are able to handle these differences in an appropriate manner. Many schools conduct their own moral education lessons that aim to teach students values and guide them towards developing proper moral reasoning. One example is the compulsory \"Values In Action\" programme implemented during curriculum hours in all schools across Singapore. It usually requires students to take on a project with the aim of helping a target group in society. Concurrently, it teaches them to be compassionate and empathise with the difficulties faced by others. Studies have shown that teachers can influence a child and inspire him to be a better person in general. Hence, it is important for schools to do their best to ensure that each child ends up with a sound set of values, so that they are equipped with sound beliefs to help them navigate through life.\nKnowledge without values is also meaningless for students in the long run. The demographics of the workforce is rapidly changing and although the qualifications for most jobs have increased, employers are now looking for workers with better values and higher emotional quotients. This can be seen in the increasing number of companies around the world that are incorporating personality tests and background checks on potential employees. This is to better profile the candidate and understand his or her character to determine their suitability for the job. Moreover, the background checks are conducted not only to find out about one'sacademic achievements, but also to check one'ssocial media accounts to better assess one'scharacter through his or her posts and online behaviour. This shows how values are equally as important as academic credentials in helping one secure a job, as well as to thrive in the workforce. Since the primary responsibility of schools is to prepare students for the workforce, they should also prepare students to deal with situations that will test their resilience and character in the future.\nIn addition, the goals of the education system globally are to meet the emotional needs and aid in the emotional development of the child as stated in Article 29 of the United Nations Charter on the Rights to an Education. This shows that governments and world leaders recognize the vital role that schools play in nurturing a child. Several countries have already put in place measures to help a child develop to his fullest potential by ensuring that the emotional needs are met by conducting programmes to teach children values and develop their character. In 2012, the Singapore government introduced the Edusave Character Award, and every year since it was introduced, rewards have been given to the students who have demonstrated excellent character and are role models for their peers. This further helps to emphasize the point that schools are not merely places to accrue knowledge, but are also places for holistic development. Some students view their teachers as \"second parents\" and do approach them for advice with difficulties they face beyond their academic work. Teachers, in this sense, are responsible for guiding their students in the right direction and urging them to make the best possible decisions in the future.\nHowever, some point out that the current education system is already over-laden with too many activities and programmes, and schools should not be made to bear the sole responsibility of imparting values to a child as well. Many would argue that it is the role of the parents to do so. I believe that parents do hold a great influence over their child and should work together with the schools in order to impart good values to their children. Teachers today already have much on their plate, to cope with not just teaching, but other administrative duties as well. Given they have so many students in one class to manage, it would also not be reasonable or realistic to expect a teacher to be responsible for so many students at a time. Moreover, parents are the main caregivers in a child'slife, and studies have shown that parents prove to have the most significant influence on shaping a child'sdevelopment and character in their growing years. Hence, parents should also be taking an active role in ensuring that students have sound morals.\nIn conclusion, schools should teach values as well as knowledge in order to complement what children learn at home and prepare them for future challenges. Certain scenarios that children encounter in school are similar to what one would expect in the workforce, albeit on a smaller scale and with fewer consequences. Teaching students how to cope with these challenges will go a long way in preparing them for the future and helping them reach their full potential."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE THAT MODERN LIFE IS PLAGUED BY FEAR AND INSECURITY?",
                "text": "\"We have nothing to fear but fear itself\". These words spoken by US President Franklin Roosevelt in the 1930s seem far removed from the modern society we live in. From transgenic food to industrial chemicals, from nuclear radiation to economic recessions, we appear to be living in a cloud of fear and insecurity. While it is undeniable that some of our contemporary fears are well-founded, it would be too absolute to assert that modern life is afflicted by apprehension and anxiety to the point where we cannot function normally as a people. Notwithstanding the constant barrage of new threats appearing on our airwaves, there are other aspects of modern society that provide us with assurance and stability, and hence while I agree that modern life is fraught with fear and insecurity, it is not necessarily plagued by them.\nFor a start, there is little doubt that many of the fears that we experience stem from the advent of new technologies which have offered us wonderful new benefits, but also present a host of new risks and dangers. Modern science is full of examples of technologies and inventions that can be used for ill as well as good – useful technologies that have done harm, intentionally or not. Take for instance, nuclear power. Our growing reliance on nuclear power to provide us with a source of clean and efficient energy in the face of dwindling oil reserves has invariably led to the rise of real fears of nuclear conflagration and radiation. Witness the scare in the aftermath of the tsunami that hit Japan in March 2011 which led to damages to the Fukushima nuclear power plant. Up to today, tourism to the region (and indeed to the whole of Japan) has been hit badly due to fears of nuclear contamination of water, food and air. Another area of scientific research that has also conjured much alarm and dread is that of biotechnology. Developments such as cloning, stem cell research, and cross-species transplant surgery have led to fearful cries that we are unwisely tampering with the natural order of things with potentially frightening and unforeseen consequences. Indeed, whether it is pushing the boundaries of the sanctity of life or challenging existing values, modern science has presented us with a litany of novel challenges and risks that have inevitably created a growing sense of fear and alarm in our modern world.\nIn the economic sphere, the vicissitudes of what has been termed \"the roller-coaster global economy\" has certainly contributed to a feeling of insecurity over the financial and economic institutions that underpin our modern international economic system. With shorter and consequently more unpredictable business cycles, the fluctuations within the global economy have caused much instability and volatility. This financial turbulence is compounded by the actions of irresponsible and greedy speculators and financial organizations such as Barnard Madoff and Lehman Brothers who take advantage of sophisticated loopholes and blind spots in the system for their own selfish gain. The result of a multitude of people worldwide who have lost their hard-earned savings from these scams and irresponsible investments has definitely left an impact on the collective psyche that our global economy is increasingly insecure and unstable. Add to this mix the brewing Eurozone crisis in countries like Greece, Spain and Italy; the mounting national debt of the US; and the slowdown in growth in the erstwhile economic giants of China and India, and it is not difficult to see how economic developments in our modern world have resulted in a prevalent feeling of uncertainty and doubt.\nIn addition to the fear and insecurity that exists at the global level, we can also witness how worry and anxiety have crept into the everyday life of modern man. At the societal level, rapid urbanization has resulted in a much more stressful pace of life with high-rise living causing people to feel more and more isolated in an increasingly impersonal world. The rise of online communications may have made our lives more convenient, yet it has also created a yawning gap between virtual reality and \"real\", physical, human interaction. The social malaise can also be felt in institutions such as marriage which has become more tenuous: marriage is less and less viewed as a sacred union between two people but more and more as a contract that can now be easily and conveniently terminated. At the same time, what used to be condemned as sins or crimes – abortion, homosexuality, children born out of wedlock – are now perceived as manifestations of an alternative lifestyle. With moral values in a shifting state of perpetual flux, it is no wonder that in the modern world we live in today, we are faced with greater uncertainty in our social lives.\nYet, it would be a mistake to focus merely on the negative aspects of modern society that evoke fear and insecurity, while neglecting those areas of our modern world that offer us enhanced security and reassurance. One area where this can be seen is the increased ease of life facilitated by modernization, where higher standards of living are achieved through a combination of the technological advancements and economic growth that we experience in our modern society. No doubt these may also generate a measure of fear and insecurity as discussed above, however we must also acknowledge that the greater convenience and comfort they bring through improved facilities and amenities have contributed to the well-being of our modern life. At the same time, the increased connectivity that we experience in our modern world can also bring about a stronger sense of community – both in real life and online – which can translate into easier access to overcome life'sdifficulties through counselling services and support groups from all over the world. This can in turn lead to a greater sense of assurance and stability in today'sworld.\nMoreover, it can also be argued that a measure of fear and insecurity can be desirable in our modern world as this serves to make us more vigilant and take precautionary measures to alleviate future ills. For instance, in the aftermath of the Asian tsunami of 2004, fears of similar future devastation drove many governments to set up advanced tsunami warning systems in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, which brought much assurance to peoples living in coastal areas in these regions. Another example was the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 which caused widespread global panic and fear, yet following this incident, governments and hospitals started to implement tighter quarantine and monitoring procedures. This consequently contributed to more stability and less panic amongst medical personnel and the public when similar viruses such as H1N1 and avian flu struck in the following years. Hence to a certain extent, it can be said that fear and insecurity in our modern society may not always be something to avoid or be plagued with.\nIn essence, there is no denying that our modern world contains much to be fearful and insecure about as the daily newspapers continue to herald new threats, unprecedented challenges and previously-undiscovered risks. Yet, as the title of a recent book – \"Are We Scaring Ourselves to Death?\" – implies, we have to be careful not to be overly pessimistic of the world we live in, or else we may become paralyzed and plagued by fear to the point that we fail to appreciate there is also much in our modern world that provides us with joy, safety and security."

                "prompt": "PARENTAL NEGLIGENCE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTOR CONTRIBUTING TO RISING JUVENILE DELINQUENCY.\" DO YOU AGREE?",
                "text": "There is a biblical proverb that goes: \"train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it\". The responsibility of grooming a child'scharacter and instilling obedience in him or her no doubt lies in the hands of the parents who brought the child into the world. Parents may argue that parental negligence is not the most significant factor, and may instead attribute it to other reasons such as peer pressure, stress and rebelliousness. This is because they feel that they have done all that they can for their children. Sadly, this ideal is not always reflected in reality. Parents today increasingly fail to inculcate morals and values in their children due to the changing priorities of both parties. Packed work schedules, the ability to work outside the office and even busier school days mean parents and children have little time for each other in today'sworld. That being said, while parental negligence is not the only factor for juvenile delinquency, it certainly is the most significant factor.\nParental negligence is often labelled as a major problem, as it is the failure of parents to provide adequately for their child'sphysical and emotional needs. Psychological neglect includes the lack of emotional support and love, chronic inattention to the child, while physical neglect refers to the deficit in meeting a child'sbasic needs such as supervision, health care or housing. According to the Children and Youth Services Review, it was found that youth in out-of-home care had nearly doubled the rate of delinquency. Moreover, neglected youth are referred to the juvenile justice system more often than their non-neglected counterparts and are also significantly younger at the time of initial referral. This is especially relevant in today'sbusy society, where about 64.2% of married-couple families with children have both parents employed. This shows that parents of the twenty-first century have significantly less time to spend with their children due to their work commitments and the constraints of office hours. As children are more impressionable at a young age, this lack of time and support shown by their parents, who are ideally their main source of support and provision, would definitely affect their development. As they grow older, these teenagers would hence have a higher tendency of rebelling, not just because of their age, but because of the sad fact that they did not have a good role model to follow after and seek guidance from in their growing up years. This is especially problematic given the rising number of outlets that teenagers can easily obtain crude information. The media often broadcasts inappropriate ideas such as how \"cool\" smoking is, underage sex or even drug-use. Without a parental figure to teach them the importance of discernment when watching or listening to such content, children may go down the path of no return, thinking that such delinquent behaviour is normalized or even cool. Therefore, this highlights the importance of a parent'spresence in the lives of their child in both their childhood and teenage years in providing guidance, discernment, as well as serving as a role model.\nHowever, while parental negligence is the most significant factor, it cannot be claimed to be the only factor contributing to delinquency amongst teenagers. Teenagers can also end up as delinquents due to peer pressure, even if they come from loving, wholesome families. According to research by the National University of Singapore, peer influence may play a greater part in affecting teenage delinquency than family-related factors because the \"emotional centre\" of teenagers shifts away from their family as they get older and start expanding their social networks. Thus, delinquency can happen if a teenager comes in contact with negative external influences outside the home, such as friends that practice underage smoking or take drugs. In fact, according to Phillip Morris, author of \"Peer Pressure and Smoking\", teenagers who had at least three friends who practiced underage smoking were ten times more likely to follow suit than those who did not. Moreover, data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation indicates that many more juvenile crimes are committed in groups as compared to adult crimes. This shows that juvenile delinquency can be attributed to the pressure teenagers face from their friends, as at that age, an individual'sthought pattern can be easily molded, and hence individuals are more easily involved in delinquent acts as a teenager. Teenagers may feel that he or she will be alone if they do not follow their peers, and this fear of isolation drives them to be part of a peer group, who might be indulging in negative activities. Therefore, other than child neglect, delinquency in juveniles could also happen due to the herd mentality and peer pressure faced.\nConversely, rather than negligence, parents can go the other extreme and spoil their children. As a result, even though they are involved in their children'slives, they fail to act as disciplinarians and therefore cannot keep their children in line. For instance, Hollywood actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie'schildren are notorious for bad behaviour, such as setting fire to leaves outdoors or being violent with fellow schoolchildren. This is often attributed by sources to the couple'scaring tendencies, particularly to the children they adopted. Moreover, with the vast amount of freedom granted, coupled with the abundance of material possessions and money these parents grant their children easily, children thus have more opportunities to mix with bad company and commit acts of felony. Therefore, although negligent parents can be the cause of juvenile delinquency, parents can also be over-caring and not have the heart to correct their children when necessary, leading to children lacking self-discipline.\nFurthermore, while parental negligence is a significant factor contributing to juvenile delinquency, it comes hand-in-hand with how children react to the lack of attention from their parents. While there is evidence proving that parental negligence does lead to higher instances of juvenile delinquency, there are children who faced child neglect growing up, but have not gotten into trouble with the law growing up, and were even able to attain success in life. It is true that children learn discipline and independence through the lack of support received from their parents, as they are also being corrected by other influences such as guardians or teachers, and it ultimately comes down to the attitude and tenacity of the child. Many celebrities such as Jamie Foxx, Kelly Clarkson and Adele were neglected by their parents at a young age and even throughout their teenage years. However, due to their spirit of resilience and strength, they chose to pick themselves up and fight hard for their dreams, despite the absence of their parents. This therefore allowed them to achieve success, and even motivated them to stay away from trouble. Therefore, whether children fall into the trap of juvenile delinquency depends on the attitude and resilience that they possess.\nUltimately, delinquency can certainly be attributed to parental negligence due to a parent'shuge role in a child'slife as his or her sole provider and source of support, as well as the root reason of a child'sneed for parental love. However, it must also be acknowledged that juvenile delinquency is caused by the interplay of factors ranging from peer pressure faced by youths, to the act of parents spoiling their children. Different cases of juvenile delinquency stem from different causes, but it is certain that a parent'srole in a child'slife cannot be replaced. Hence, I would agree that the most important factor for delinquency is the negligence of a child by his or her parents."

                "prompt": "\"A GOOD GOVERNMENT IS ONE THAT IS ABLE TO MAKE UNPOPULAR DECISIONS.\" DISCUSS.",
                "text": "At the core, governments are decision-makers. They have to make decisions which would directly influence their citizens, and a good government is one that is revered by its citizens for the contribution it makes to its people. Undeniably, unpopular decisions that are beneficial to the future of the country may sometimes be necessary. However, in light of current political trends most countries adopt, it has become more difficult to make unpopular decisions. Nevertheless, some popular decisions made by ignorant or unscrupulous governments may be detrimental to the country. As such, I agree that a good government needs to be able to bite the bullet and make unpopular decisions that are crucial for the country'ssurvival.\nA good government must have courage to make unpopular decisions that would benefit the country. The government is the only institution with a bird'seye view of all stakeholders within the country. Unlike ordinary citizens which may have a limited view of situations, the government has the capacity and the capability to consider the future. Thus, the government sees the big picture and is able to weigh the benefits and costs pragmatically, before deciding on its actions. Consider for instance, the National Security Agency (NSA), a governing body in the United States of America, which had controversially tapped on to phone calls and messages of individuals to track terrorist activities. When news of these nationwide spying was leaked, many individuals were outraged at such massive breach of privacy. It would not be difficult to empathise with the Americans over such a blatant breach of privacy. However if we consider the context under which the surveillance program was implemented, the issue is not as black and white as it seems. The surveillance program was implemented in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. In the immediate aftermath, strict security measures were put in place such as body scans in the airport. Individuals, at that time, were more than willing to sacrifice their personal privacy in exchange for security. Ten years onward, the threat and fear of a terrorist attack has waned along with the harrowing memory of the 9/11 attack. Contrary to public beliefs, terrorist attacks are still a threat to Americans as proven by the recent rise of terrorist group ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria). Therefore, it is evident that US citizens also failed to recognize just how valuable the policy is after living through a long era of peace. Thus, unpopular decisions must be made in order to ensure the well-being of citizens.\nHowever, a good government must not only have the courage to make unpopular decisions but also do so without losing their mandate to govern. It is still important that governments be strategic in making decisions. Most countries today adopt democracy as their system of government. This means that the government of a country is elected by the people. Moreover, people today are more educated and are more fervent in fighting for change that they deem beneficial even if it may not be true. This would mean that if a good government were to lose popularity among its people, it might lose its power and this could lead to a transient government which could hinder long-term progress. For example, the Singapore government has implemented many beneficial policies such as the Central Provident Fund (CPF), a compulsory and comprehensive saving plan for working Singaporeans and Permanent Residents which would fund their retirement, healthcare and housing needs. A recent review of the policy to increase minimum contribution sum has caused protests amongst some Singaporeans. In this situation, the government'sdecisions were well founded and for the benefit of the people. However, some Singaporeans were unhappy about it. This puts Singapore'sgovernment in a tight spot because they could lose popularity and thus lose its governance over Singapore. Of course, that would be destabilizing to the country if it were to become reality. Hence a good government would have to recognise the fact that the people'ssupport is important. They must be able to reach out to people and allow them to understand the benefits of their policies. In this sense, Singapore has managed to fulfil this through platforms such as \"Our Singapore Conversations\" where individuals give feedback and also learn more about current policies. This ensures that people do not feel alienated from the government'sdecisions and the government would be able to remain in control. Therefore, a good government must not only have the courage to make unpopular decisions but also be able to remain in power through good communications with the people.\nNevertheless, being stubborn in making unpopular decisions could end up harming citizens instead. This can occur when governments are ignorant of the current situation or if the government is corrupt. An ignorant government may mistake the possible merits of the decision or they could underestimate the costs of the decision. These policies are more often than not opposed by citizens of the country. In such situations, having the courage to implement the policy despite strong opposition can lead to undesirable outcomes for the country. To illustrate this, Brazil won the bid to host the 2014 FIFA World Cup. However, the victory was not celebrated by many. With many parts of the country undeveloped and social services uncared for, many Brazilians were not keen on the idea of spending billions of dollars on huge soccer stadiums that would serve no other purpose other than hosting the World Cup. As such, the disgruntled members of the public took to the streets and carried out massive protests, hampering the preparations and infrastructure building for the World Cup. Although the government justified its spending by citing the huge tourism revenue and the boosting of Brazil'simage, much of their claims were overly optimistic. Multiple economic studies have shown that hosting major sporting events have more often than not led to more social problems and negative economic benefits. People'sstandard of living might deteriorate because of the huge debt the government might incur. In such scenarios, courage and confidence are often baseless and detrimental to society. The incompetence of the government led to failure and the people suffering as an unfortunate consequence. Hence, having the courage to make unpopular decisions might not be the mark of a good government if such unpopular decisions are clearly detrimental to the society.\nAll in all, a good government has to have the foresight and courage to make decisions that are beneficial and necessary for the country regardless of how unpopular it may be. It should also be astute enough to ensure its citizens still pledge support to it. Only through this way can the government implement policies that will benefit the nation in the long run. As more people become educated, they would demand greater say in decision making for the country. This could become a greater challenge for governments in policy making. Therefore a good government is also one that understands the paramount importance of reaching out and letting people understand the rationale of the policies they implement."

                "prompt": "\"HOW CRUCIAL IS A SENSE OF HISTORY IN SHAPING SINGAPORE\"S FUTURE?",
                "text": "Since the earliest civilizations, humans have always been interested in our past: who we are, where we come from and how people lived before us. The maintenance of traditions even until today all show some kind of remembrance of a culture'spast and helps to commemorate milestones in the community, which are important enough to be remembered by all future generations. These acts of historical recollection are crucial as history is closely tied to one'spersonal identity and one'ssense of belonging. Therefore, a sense of one'shistory is highly important, not just for the individual but for any nation such as Singapore. As Machiavelli once said, \"whoever wishes to foresee the future must first consult the past.\" The future of a nation be it in the economic or socio-cultural sense, thus hinges on its understanding of its past.\nSpecifically for a diverse and young state such as Singapore, having a sense of history is so crucial as it helps the country to establish its unique national identity. For Singapore, history and citizenship are closely interconnected. Therefore, not understanding one'snational history weakens one'ssense of belonging in the country. A nation like Singapore is a community shared by people of many diverse backgrounds. After all, Singapore'sdays as a port meant that migrants from places like China, India and Myanmar all came and settled here. Thus, rather than focusing on the division based on where people came from, the shared identity of \"Singaporeans\" was emphasized. This was only possible because of the common history the migrants and their offspring shared when they came to Singapore to find opportunities, and their experiences during the Japanese Occupation. Hence, it is evident that for progress into the future to occur for a nation as a whole, a shared sense of history is needed so that people can look beyond their differences for a meaningful shared trait.\nSome critics assert that national identity need not always hinge on rhetoric based on the past. The present realities of speedy economic growth, technological improvements and radical lifestyle changes define Singapore as we know it now, as well as the Singapore in the years to come. Understanding that as a society will no doubt help Singapore as a whole to progress even as the world changes. That said, the need to define the Singaporean identity in an age of globalization and fragmentation has become all the more important. The Singapore government today has recognized this and has therefore always placed great emphasis on multiculturalism as an important defining trait of Singapore. For such a claim to be made about Singapore society,the past has to be recounted, be it wartime accounts or articles on Singapore and Malaysia'smerger. As such, Singapore'scultural identity as a nation with people of diverse ethnicities living in harmony needs to rely much on the shared knowledge of past events.\nIn the chase for modernity and instantaneity, many Singaporeans believe that holding on to the past is sentimental to the point of being impractical. They would rather Singapore be defined by where we are going, not where we came from. Sadly, such a perspective is self-defeating. Without retrospect, there can be no progress, nor purpose. After all, the past offers us valuable lessons and ideas that can help us progress and prevent us from repeating the mistakes we made in the past. One famous example would be how Singapore learnt its lesson from the Maria Hertogh riots in 1950 that was sparked by tension due to the traditions of one race not being respected by the law. Thus, with such knowledge of the past, Singapore has managed to prevent race-related strife from brewing through adequate public education and respect for all races in legislation. This shows that with an understanding of the past comes a better understanding of how Singapore should manage the present and future generations in order to create an environment that allows holistic progress.\nYet another reason that a sense of history is so crucial to Singapore'sfuture is because a sense of history is not something static or unable to adapt with the times. Rather, it serves as a guide to prevent us from straying too far from the desired status quo for peace, harmony and progress. For example, after the horrifying terror events of September 11 and the Bali bombings of 2004, the peace in multi-religious Singapore became extremely fragile. This was when ministers such as then-senior minister Lee Kuan Yew reminded the country of how precious peace between ethnic groups was, and how Singapore needs to be resilient and not stray off from the mutual respect each and every ethnicity had for each other. Therefore, it was through an understanding and reverence for the past that Singapore has managed to solve the most pressing issues of its modern self.\nHence, for Singapore, or any country for that matter, to sustainably progress and succeed in the future, a shared sense of history is crucial, if not necessary. It stops us from repeating past mistakes, teaches us to handle current issues and bonds the country through the shared identity forged in the past. This not only helps the country to achieve pragmatic goals such as economic wealth and social wellbeing but also forges a country and community with soul and genuine patriotism."

                "text": "The thirty-fourth President of the United States, Dwight D. Eisenhower, once remarked that \"every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.\" Indeed, when a world war breaks out, money, time, and talent from world economies go to waste. It thus seems like an irrational decision for countries to be embroiled in a conflict, much less a world war that puts the prosperity of countries at stake. Yet, I believe that the possibility of a world war can be entertained despite the shifting trend to soft power, due to the development of nuclear weapons research, the desire of countries to dominate and the failure of sanctions to prevent a world war from occurring.\nFor some, the possibility of a world war in the near future cannot be entertained because of the growing emergence of soft power as a tool to reduce conflicts with other countries. Soft power – a term coined by Joseph Nye – is defined as a persuasive approach to international relations, typically involving the use of economic or cultural influence. According to Nye, a country'ssoft power rests on three resources: its culture, political values and foreign policies. With an attractive culture, strong political values and legitimate foreign policies, a country is able to establish an internal presence in the global scene. Hence, the possession of soft power is often advocated as a useful model to resolve external conflicts today. Soft power provides a country with the ability to gain more alliances – translated to political strength – that would play an ever more crucial role in avoiding a world war in the future. An example would be \"Hallyu\", also known as the Korean Wave, which refers to the increase in popularity of South Korean culture. The Korean Wave is used by the government as a soft power tool to engage with the masses of young people all over to reduce anti-Korean sentiment. South Korea'sentertainment industry – which prides itself on its ability to attract multitudes of fan bases comprising adolescents and adults worldwide – is cited as one of the most important factors in contributing to the spread and exposure of South Korean culture to people abroad. When other countries have a positive impression of South Korea, they are more likely to give it the support it needs in terms of political solidarity – which is no doubt, indeed a useful counter-balance vis-à-vis North Korea. Instead of resorting to hard power – the use of military and economic means to influence the behaviour or interests of other political bodies – it seems possible for countries to rely on soft power as a tool to establish good foreign relations with other countries.\nYet, despite the ability of soft power to reduce a world war from occurring, this view neglects the fact that soft power available to a country can be exploited and abused by others, to devastating effect. US brands such asTwitter and Facebook – social media tools that the United States uses to enhance its soft power, is currently being exploited by the extremist jihadist rebel group, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), to glorify their monstrous behaviour to such a formidable degree that it can terrify adversaries into surrendering territory; and persuade Europe'stroubled Muslim youths to quit Western lifestyles and join ISIS. The capability of soft power to reach out to more people across the world in its quest to build a caliphate utopia proves that the prospect of a world war in the future can be entertained. Moreover, the effectiveness of soft power is subjective. More often than not, soft power is only a futile effort against countries which already hold deeply-ingrained grudges towards a country. Russia, despite a relentless campaign to advance its soft power by providing markets for foreign goods, has received much flak for its support for Ukrainian separatist rebels and the annexation of Crimea. In this case, the notion of soft power'sability to prevent world war is misplaced.\nAdditionally, the development of nuclear weapons research is a threat that results in a higher risk of global destruction occurring in the near future. The rapid development of nuclear weaponry may heighten tensions between countries, especially in countries whose motives of conducting nuclear weapons research are questionable. An arms race results when countries with no nuclear weapons are threatened by neighbouring countries with nuclear weapons. With more countries equipped with nuclear arsenals, other countries are on tenterhooks and tend to behave recklessly which may trigger a world war in the near future. Despite Iran'sclaims that its atomic bomb research is peaceful, Israel disapproves of the United Nation'snuclear watchdog decision to withhold reports of suspicions that Iran researched on how to make an atomic bomb – a potential hazard to Iran'sneighbouring countries – for reasons of diplomatic sensitivity. It is understandable for Israel, which is the only nation in the Middle East comprising Jews, to feel threatened with its Islamic neighbouring countries possessing nuclear weaponry. For Israel, this will be the proverbial \"straw that breaks the camel'sback\" and a world war may likely be triggered if Israel is pressurized to attack countries in the Middle East in the name of \"self-defence\". Therefore, the prospect of a future world war in the near future can be entertained or even, acknowledged with serious consideration, due to the greater risks of global destruction posed by the development of nuclear weapons.\nFurthermore, the ultimate reason that sparks a world war – the desire for power – has remained unchanged throughout the years. Like the Cold War, which broke out between the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc in a futile attempt to gain more geopolitical power, who is to say that another world war will not break out in the near future whereby countries attempt to monopolise global influence? Although there are regional and international policies implemented today that are serving their purpose in allocating resources in a fair and equitable manner, there are, however, exceptions where countries are not content with their lot. The innate desire of countries to dominate power, coupled with the global issue of resource depletion, increases the possibility that a world war may break out in the near future as countries engage in a desperate struggle for resources. A recent event that has been dubbed as a potential world war event is the China-Japan conflict due to Japan'sacquisition of the Senkaku islands. While Japan claims that the disputed lands were vacant before 1895, China argues that it owned the islands before 1895 based on ancient Chinese texts and maps which show that the Chinese regarded the islands as theirs. In other words, Japan'sseizure of the islands violated China'srights. But ultimately, is it not the desire to gain more power from the acquisition of lands the sole reason for the disputes between countries? In addition, with the ability of countries to lend, or remove, support to countries in conflict today due to the growing interdependence of countries, there is a possibility of a future world war if many countries are involved in the same conflict. Saying that the possibility of a world war in the future cannot be entertained is thus naïve taking into consideration that the desire for power of countries has remained largely unchanged throughout the years.\nWhile some may argue that economic sanctions imposed can deter a future world war event, the truth is that there are ways to circumvent these as there will always be other states to supply and provide supplies and markets. In recent times, economic sanctions, rather than military force, are often employed in a crisis to interrupt commercial relations and weaken the economy, and by extension, the military potential of the country being sanctioned. Sanctions buy time, allowing adversaries to consider the repercussions of countries acting on a moment of impulse to trigger a world war. This ultimately deters a future world war event from occurring. However, sanctions are largely ineffective in achieving this primary aim. Despite imposing economic sanctions on Russia by countries like Germany and the United States because of its aggressive actions in Crimea to hamper trade and cripple its economy, there are other countries such as China, who are willing to supply and trade its goods with Russia. Russia is still able to get by, even with the meagre source of income from trade with only a few trading countries. Worse, sanctions may sometimes provoke the victim country instead to retaliate in other ways, possibly by resorting to military violence. Therefore, the possibility of a world war in the near future can be entertained for the fact that economic sanctions – one of the factors commonly used to prevent a world war from occurring – is actually proven to be largely ineffective.\nTo conclude, it may seem that the chances of a world war occurring in the near future are becoming smaller because in today, more and more countries are increasingly interdependent on one another for trade and other relations. However, the possibility of a world war occurring in the near future must still be entertained."

                "prompt": "IS THERE STILL PRIVACY IN TODAY\"S WORLD ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE NEED FOR NATIONAL SECURITY?",
                "text": "\"To be left alone is the most precious thing one can ask of the modern world,\" quipped English writer Anthony Burgess. While alluding to solitude and being alone, this quote has seen greater relevance in modern times with respect to one'sprivacy. Privacy – the ability of an individual to keep information regarding him away from the knowledge of others – is becoming an increasingly debatable issue. Unfortunately, as much as people desire for their personal information to be kept solely to themselves, this is getting increasingly impossible in today'sworld as technology has allowed organisations such as governments to tap into personal information against the will of individuals for the purposes of national security. Nonetheless, contrary to popular belief that privacy no longer exists, there are many instances where privacy still remains, such as the cases of political privacy and laws to protect privacy rights of citizens. As such, it is erroneous to claim that there is no more privacy in today'sworld.\nIn today'sworld, it appears as if privacy may need to be sacrificed for the sake of national security. After various catastrophic acts of terrorism, such as the notable 9/11 attacks against New York'sWorld Trade Centre, it is quintessential for governments to fulfil their role of protecting their citizens by preventing such acts from happening again. In an increasingly globalised world characterised by greater movements of people and goods across international borders daily, national security needs to be improved to deter any potential threats to a country'ssecurity and the safety of its citizens. With improvements in surveillance technology to collect and analyse data of large numbers of people, governments can easily and clandestinely collect personal information for profiling. This will enable them to more effectively identify potential threats to national security and intervene more quickly. An example of this is the National Counterterrorism Centre which is a US government organisation responsible for national and international counterterrorism efforts. It has the authority to collect, store and analyse extensive data on US citizens, compiled from governmental and non-governmental sources, in order to detect any suspicious behaviour. Former National Security Agent, William Binney, also admitted that the organisation is able to intercept the phone calls, financial transactions and emails of US citizens. In such cases, even though personal information is being shared with governments against the knowledge or consent of individuals, it appears inevitable that the privacy of citizens has to be compromised for greater security and safety for society.\nDespite the need to intrude into people'sprivacy for more security, in a world where people are increasingly concerned about their privacy, governments around the world have also realised their onus to set up laws to protect the privacy of their citizens. In this day and age where technology allows personal information to be easily accessed by others, many nations worldwide have agreed that privacy is a right that should be granted to all people and that individuals should be allowed by law to defend this right. The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, adopted by the United Nations since 1966, has an article that protects privacy, which states that \"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence\". It also grants everyone the right to be protected by law against any such interference. As such, this treaty acknowledges that there should be regulations set in place to defend the personal information of individuals. To date, 168 states have agreed to the treaty, and have in turn established their own legislations to protect the privacy of their citizens. In Singapore, for instance, the Protection of Private Data Act was enforced in 2013 for this very purpose. It can be seen that privacy still exists in today'sworld with the protection of personal information through the help of laws and regulations set up by governments.\nMoreover, in an increasingly democratic world, the political privacy of ordinary citizens is especially important in ensuring fair and unbiased voting so that they are protected against intimidation by electoral candidates. As more and more nations begin to adopt the voting system in government elections, political privacy is an increasingly pertinent right for all citizens, as candidates voted into parliament are expected to serve all citizens equally, without any bias towards those in favour of them or discrimination against people who voted against them. This is only possible if the choices of individual voters are kept secret. A case in point would be my society, Singapore, where polling stations for elections are set up with individual booths where voters are given their own space to mark their ballot paper. One is also advised to keep his vote a secret. This is also the case for many countries worldwide. Hence, privacy still exists as citizens are able to keep their political choices secret and unknown by other people.\nAll in all, despite privacy being a lawful right and having various means to protect it, it is an undeniable reality that people enjoy less privacy today than in the past, with technology that can potentially allow personal information to be disclosed to various organisations clandestinely, even if for grounds such as national security. That said, it is too extreme to assert that privacy no longer exists in today'sworld even if it is increasingly harder to achieve."

                "prompt": "\"FOREIGN AID DOES NOT SOLVE LONG-TERM PROBLEMS.\" TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS A FAIR VIEWPOINT?",
                "text": "China spends $38 billion in development aid; the United States $31.08 billion; and the entire OECD'sDevelopment Assistance Committee member'stotal budget for development aid reached 142 billion in 2017. At first glance, foreign aid seems constructive and helpful, a sign of goodwill by more developed countries towards developing ones, as part of a world trying to move towards equality. However, foreign aid has also been criticised for not helping to solve long-term problems. Ultimately, while the resources from foreign aid are undeniably valuable, there are many other factors which have led to its failure to do so, including the way they are utilised and managed by countries of destination as well as the intent and pattern of giving from the countries of origin.\nFor a start, it must be acknowledged that foreign aid has solved long-term problems before, even those such cases are not always the default. They are usually able to solve long term problems related to health. The eradication of smallpox (the last death from the disease was in 1978) was partly thanks to foreign aid. Calculations estimate that between 60 and 120 million premature deaths were averted due to its eradication. Today, foreign aid continues to work to eradicate diseases like malaria, saving up to 10 million lives a year. With the end goal being eradication of these diseases which are infectious and often caused by poor living environments and sanitation, they are tackling long-term problems which affect the people'squality of life and ability to be productive. It has also directly worked to develop countries\" economies, such as Taiwan'sand South Korea'swhich took off thanks to foreign aid from the US. Between 1946 and 1975, economic and military aid to South Korea and Taiwan were $69 billion and $42 billion respectively and today, the two countries join the ranks of the other Asian Tigers, with highly developed economies.\nUnfortunately, the above examples have not necessarily replicated themselves in places like other developing countries which continue to struggle despite the massive amounts of aid that continues to pour into them. For example, the US also gave aid to Vietnam. In fact, Vietnam received $115 billion between 1954 and 1975, more than what was given to both South Korea and Taiwan combined. Yet, its economy is nowhere near as successful. Similarly, the disproportionate amount of aid received by countries in Africa has not seemed to produce the same effects. As economist William Easterly showed, percentage growth actually fell from the 70s even as aid as percentage of GDP increased.\nSome have even argued that foreign aid not only fails to solve problems, but often causes more problems to development. It has been cited to prop up dictators such as Congo'sMobutu Sese Seko or Ethipia'sMeles Zenawi. In the latter case, Human Rights Watch documented how the dictator selectively withheld aid-financed famine relief from everyone except those within his party. Another example is how a World Bank financed forestry project in Uganda ended up with a forest fire and over 20,000 farmers losing their homes, and soldiers threatening those who retaliated with violence. Such examples make it hard to agree that aid can solve long term problems. On the whole, whether foreign aid works thus lies in whether they are funding a country with strong institutions with potential for growth, or feeding one that is corrupted. David Cameron said that it is not really about the quantity of aid but rather what he terms as the \"golden thread\", which is whether the country has stable government, lack of corruption, human rights, the rule of law and transparent information. It is when these institutions are in place, that the dollars can make sense.\nNonetheless, donor countries also have the responsibility to consider carefully how they disburse their aid. Unfortunately, the pattern of giving has been one of fragmentation. Donor countries want to seem as generous as possible, so they give to many countries, but in small amounts. This leads to aid coming from more directions but in smaller amounts. In 2013, the average project funded by aid was worth $1.9 million in 2013, down from $5.3 million in 2000. In Mozambique, it has 27 donors in the field of health alone, but some countries each give less than $1 million. This kind of fragmentation reduces the efficiency of aid, because they require civil servants to manage and oversee, increasing the amount of bureaucracy while having less economies of scale in terms of impact.\nAnother problem with foreign aid is also how donor countries decide to give. Long term problems require long term aid, but countries often fluctuate in their level of support, withdrawing support just when developing countries begin to gain traction. Researchers have found that donors tend to prefer short term projects with measurable results, a demand which aid agencies are thus inclined to meet. Thus, aid has been largely successful in building schools, infrastructure, which are tangible with straightforward benefits and timeline. However, they are not able to build strong institutions, which as discussed previously are more important.\nLastly, aid is often conditional, with donor countries threatening to withdraw them if their demands are not met. Aid is after all, not as altruistic and humanitarian as it is made out to be. Developed countries use aid to promote their interests and ideologies. For example, the UK gives more aid to Pakistan, Syria, Ethiopia, Nigeria and Afghanistan, countries which are not the poorest, but rather where the UK wishes to influence politically whether because they have a dictator or where radical Islam is taking root. Other than political ideology, developed countries also use aid to benefit themselves economically, in the form of tied aid, where aid is used to purchase items from the giving country itself. For example, close to 80% of the US Agency for International Development'scontracts and grants go directly to American firms. Sometimes, aid is given as loans, which only leads to debt accumulation. Thus, aid can reproduce existing inequalities between countries instead of helping them solve long-term problems.\nTo sum up, there are many barriers in the real world which have led to foreign aid not being able to solve long term problems. This is primarily because they are not the key to solving them, but rather a possible resource to do so. In order to solve long term problems, there is indeed, no single panacea or silver bullet."

                "prompt": "IS PRESSURE A MOTIVATING FORCE OR A CAUSE FOR UNHAPPINESS?",
                "text": "Robert Horry once said, \"Pressure can break pipes. It can also make diamonds.\" Indeed, pressure can be both a motivating force but also a cause for unhappiness, as it can cause one to feel stressed, but can also be construed as a motivating force to push oneself to do better, or do something faster. At the same time, it is important to recognize that pressure is such a broad concept and can come from so many various sources and manifest itself in so many different forms. It can be self-imposed or due to expectations from others; it can be short-term such as when there is an urgent deadline, or long-term such as when one feels pressured to lead his or her life is a different way. It can be argued that pressure when based on goals will be more likely to be a motivating force, while pressure that is experienced over a longer period of time, will more likely cause one unhappiness.\nSome argue that without pressure, no \"diamonds\" can be made. This is due to it contributing to two ingredients for success – the desire for success and the motivation to improve oneself. Without a desire to succeed, there is no need for pressure. The greater the desire, the greater the pressure. Additionally, pressure causes one to act, to improve oneself. Without pressure, people will not work harder in preparation and people will not be able to train themselves mentally to be resilient and strong, qualities which will help them advance their goals.  In this sense, pressure is an example of an obstacle in one'slife, which challenges one to overcome it, with the prize on the other side. Pressure requires one to be tougher, and requires one to manage it. Athletes who are training their entire lives in order to put on their best performance at a competition will undoubtedly feel pressured, but that is not because they are not well-prepared, but rather because they want to triumph badly. When pressured, people work harder. Pressure thus does not promise to be easy, but it does promise to be rewarding.\nHowever, pressure that comes from the expectations of others can be both a motivating force and a cause for unhappiness. In the case of children who are expected by their parents to do well in subjects – even those they have no interest in – pressure is clearly undesirable. However, for pressure that arises from the weight of other people'shope such as when entire countries rally behind their athletes, it can be considered a motivating force. When it was plausible that Joseph Schooling could clinch Singapore'sfirst gold medal, there were talks about it all over the country, which is likely to have increased the stakes and pressure for Schooling. Yet, Schooling used such pressure as motivation, and ultimately did manage to clinch the gold medal and made his supporters proud. This is as the pressure was not only a form of expectation, but also support; it is not based on punishment, but rather goodwill and hope, and in this way, pressure can be positive.\nHowever, pressure when imposed on oneself over prolonged periods of time can make one unhappy, as it can lead to both physical toil and mental turmoil. Science has shown that prolonged pressure can lead to symptoms like migraines and headaches which impede functioning, as well as well-being. It has effects on nearly every part of the body, from causing gastrointestinal disorders to endocrine malfunctioning. Unexplained disorders are thus often a result of stress. For example, athletes who are pressured may force themselves to train way harder than they actually want to, making them fatigued and ironically, able to perform less than optimally, setting themselves up for a vicious cycle as they then try to train even harder to make up for it. People may tell themselves that they are never good enough, which in suitable doses makes one work harder. However, if one continually subjects oneself to such criticism whether by themselves or by others, they are setting themselves up for lower self-esteem. The pressure thus causes people to break because regardless of how much they work, they never think they can succeed. This is the basis of the best-selling book \"Secret\", which encourages readers to do the opposite and believe in themselves instead of being overcome by pressure.\nPressure can also cause unhappiness when they make goals the end in itself.  Ultimately, this can even lead them to think of success as something they must have, rather than a desirable goal. The difference between the two is that the former will make people tie their self-worth and their entire world to whether they succeed or not. This is so true for many students who are extremely pressured by expectations arising from themselves, teachers or parents that they must perform well for their exams, believing that any other outcomes are construed as failures. Stories of young children committing suicide after scoring poorly for exams in Singapore are unfortunate examples of how pressure can be toxic.\nFinally, we must also take into consideration the fact that different people have different capacities for pressure. While some enjoy the adrenaline of pressure and perform well under it, others cannot cope with it and break under it. It is thus more important for people to identify for themselves when they are over the optimal threshold, when pressure switches from motivating force to a cause for unhappiness, and then apply strategies that work for them. Different people have different strategies to deal with it: some people will take a break from what they are pressured by, such as by playing recreational sports or engaging in their hobbies while others require the support of family and close ones.\nIn conclusion, whether pressure is a motivating force or a cause for unhappiness depends on why one is experiencing pressure, and how one experiences it.  As with many things in life, balance is what people should strive for, in order to make pressure a friend rather than a foe."

                "prompt": "EVALUATE THE CLAIM THAT ACHIEVING AN INCLUSIVE SOCIETY IS A DESIRABLE BUT UNREALISTIC GOAL.",
                "text": "The dream of creating an inclusive society – where all members benefit from progress and equality of opportunity, diversity is celebrated instead of shunned, and all individuals are allowed to participate in deciding the creation and direction of social institutions – is a lofty one. It is often criticised for being quixotic and for neglecting the fact that existing measures tend to inevitably emphasise the differences between individuals; that there are finite resources for an infinite number of groups, and that achieving a truly inclusive society requires an overhaul of the ways in which Western capitalist economies and the international economy function. While an inclusive society is certainly desirable because it promotes a more tolerant society to live in and encourages individuals in society to unleash their fullest potential and contribute to society in unconventional, creative ways, the process of achieving an inclusive society is a contentious one. In fact, it is often argued that efforts to make society more inclusive is often unrealistic and might even conflict with the need to be factually accurate.\nEven the more calibrated approaches which we use today to promote the acceptance of society inadvertently create a society that is made aware of such differences, but are tolerant and not truly accepting of them.Singapore, for instance, adopted the multicultural approach towards nation-building, which saw the construction of a national identity which could accommodate ethnic and linguistic pluralism while simultaneously inculcating an overarching sense of nationhood. Multicultural policies such as the Ethnic Integration Policy, the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) racial classification model and the Reserved Presidential Elections stress the importance of peaceful coexistence while reminding us that we are indeed, very different people from very different social groups. While Singapore claims to have achieved a \"harmonious and inclusive\" society, in reality, racial and religious tensions simmer beneath the surface; according to a recent YouGov survey, 23% of Singaporeans claim to have experienced discrimination while renting properties. Minorities seem to be disproportionately affected, with 49% of Indians surveyed and 34% of Malays reporting such experiences. More than 80% of minorities also report the occurrence of \"microaggressions\" in their daily lives, suggesting that even a society like Singapore which tries its best to be inclusive has a long way to go. The inadequacy of current measures means that an inclusive society will have to remain a pipe dream for now.\nAn inclusive society is also one where all its members benefit from its progress. In today'scontext, this is often achieved through taxation and government transfers, such as unemployment assistance, with the objective of ensuring that the poorest do not trail behind in the wake of the rich. It can be argued that to achieve this is impossible, since there are finite resources for an infinite number of social groups clamouring for their voices to be heard. Governments have to prioritise between devoting their resources to promoting the progress of certain groups and ensuring that others are not left behind. Even social democracies which have high taxation rates are not necessarily able to mitigate inequality. Norway, which has an astounding personal income tax rate of 38.52% and a widely lauded social security net, has seen an increase in poverty and inequality, from 7.7% of the population to 9.3% in just the last 4 years. In other countries like Singapore, even after tax transfers facilitated by the government, the Gini coefficient is relatively high at 0.41, suggesting that the efforts of governments alone are insufficient. Besides direct government transfers, governments have to prioritise when devoting resources to agencies helping different social groups, hence making an inclusive society a chimeric fantasy.\nFurthermore, eradicating income inequality and the inequality of opportunities require an overhaul of the capitalist system of Western nations and the global economy, which is simply quixotic and unrealistic. The free movement of labour, goods and capital across national borders along with rapid technological advancement means that technically able, high-skilled workers tend to command higher wages, while low-skilled manual workers are easily displaced by an influx of workers from less developed countries. Inequality has risen drastically across the world, in both developing and developed countries as a result: in Brazil, the top 1% accounts for 25% of national income; in Russia, the income share of the top 1% of the population increased from 4% in 1980 to 20% in 2015. Likewise, in India, that figure rose from 6% in 1982 to 22% in 2013 and in China, it surged from 6% in 1978 to 14% in 2015. Compound this with the fact that the rich tend to pass on financial and social privileges to their offspring, and inequality is entangled with decreasing levels of social mobility. This suggests that attempts to create an inclusive society have to take into account the overarching societal framework which we operate in, and a total overhaul of it seems implausible. Even in countries which adopt alternative models such as communism, there is often skyrocketing inequality as well. Even though communist countries like the Soviet Union managed to reduce income inequality to unprecedented levels, it did so by reducing the size of the pie for everyone, and displacing existing capitalist structures with other hierarchies that disadvantaged the poor and the unfortunate. It appears that in the current context, achieving an inclusive society might just be an ideal, at best.\nAt the same time, we need to recognize that the above arguments rest on the assumption that an inclusive society is desirable; it well may not be, indeed. Many argue that an inclusive society where diversity is celebrated and not resented is a more tolerant, pleasant one to live in, and allows individuals of varied talents to live up to their true potential. If Singapore had not created a space for entrepreneurship, or encouraged its students to deviate from traditional models of success, the likes of Carousell, honestbee and ViSenze would not have existed. That said, however, efforts to make society more inclusive might conflict with the need to be factually accurate. For instance, sporting authorities in the Western world have permitted the participation of transsexual individuals in sporting events, as societies become more progressive and inclusive over time. However, critics often cite the unfair advantage that pre-transition transgender athletes have over biological females, which is ignored when transgender athletes are allowed to participate as females, as an example of \"inclusivity\" being taken to the extreme, to the extent that reality is wilfully distorted.\nBy and large, an inclusive society is desirable and pleasant to live in, as it maximises human potential, if it is created or done in moderation. However, because there are finite resources for an infinite number of social groups clamouring to be included, the reality is that achieving an inclusive society can only remain a pipe dream for now."

                "text": "When Joseph Schooling bagged a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, Singapore'sfirst ever, the whole country celebrated his win. Schooling also received a $1 million cash prize for bringing such glory to Singapore, and has since been named Sportsman Of The Year four times. However, Schooling'sfeat was unparalleled, and sporting achievements, at nearly all levels, are not given adequate recognition in Singapore to a large extent. This issue of sporting achievements not being well-recognized extends from an early age up till professional level sports, which has implications for the extent to which sports can be developed in Singapore.\nSingapore is an academic-focused society, which has led to sporting achievements being undermined for our younger generations. Parents would prefer their children to score straight As than to win a sports competition. Playing sports is considered good for health but nothing to be taken seriously, should one be interested or have a talent. After all, test results are key to students for getting promoted to the next grade, applying to scholarships or getting into good schools. While schemes like Direct School Admission have increased the value of sporting achievement, it is still considered a \"bonus\", rather than as the equivalent of academic excellence. The setting up of the Singapore Sports School was aimed to provide greater support to student athletes, but even there, a premium is given to academic results, as students are expected to do well in both sports and academics.\nThis lack of priority given to sporting achievements from an early age is because a sporting career is simply not considered a viable option in Singapore in terms of monetary rewards. While Schooling no doubt made his parents immensely proud after his massive win at the Olympics, his parents made the leap of faith that not many other parents would likely do. They supported him not only by giving him the permission to pursue his dream, but sacrificing their own assets in order to provide him with the resources to do so when the government was not nearly as generous with theirs. What Schooling'sparents did may be considered an \"investment\" to some, but it is more of a sacrifice – becoming a successful sportsman or sportswoman is not a given. After all, monetary riches for athletes are not common. It was revealed in 2017 by Jose Raymond, Vice-Chairman of the Chiam See Tong Sports Foundation, that some athletes receive just $600 a year from the government, with one of them being a SEA Gold Medallist. Some also point out that Schooling'sparents at least had the means to make sacrifices, but other athletes from less comfortable backgrounds may be forced to give up their dreams if they cannot even make a living. Some of them have thus taken crowdfunding in order to do so as they train for sporting achievements, such as Sarah Pang (a tennis player) and Sayidah Aisyah (a rower). U.K. Shyam, the record holder for fastest 100m, also recalled how he once had to quit running because he was not able to pay the bills.\nSporting achievement is also not lucrative because it is not as well recognised by the general public. Joseph Schooling bagged several advertisement deals after his win, becoming the face for famous brands like DBS, Yakut, Milo and HUGO BOSS. Clearly, his high-profile win at the Olympics made him an icon in Singapore society, which gives him marketing value. This is also true for many other famous athletes in the world, whether Michael Jordan with his own Nike line, or Cristiano Ronaldo (with 322 million social media followers) who also has a $1 billion Nike Contract and his own brand, CR7. However, local sporting athletes are not nearly as well known by the public. This is also due to an overall lack of interest in sports in general. During the early days of Singapore football when locals were more fired up by it, local footballers like Fandi Ahmad had many fans. However, attention to local leagues and competitions is no longer comparable to international level competitions whether in football or tennis. Without some level of recognition by society, sporting achievement by local athletes does not translate to fame and fortune, unlike in the case of other countries.\nHow sporting achievement is defined also determines how it is recognised in Singapore. The overall situation In Singapore when it comes to the recognition of sporting achievement is a polarised one. If one is not exceptionally talented and achieves incredible results such as in the case of Schooling, one is not recognised and duly rewarded, or even supported. This stems from Singapore'spragmatism in the measurement of sporting achievement. Athletes are ranked into different levels depending on their potential to represent Singapore at regional or national levels, and ultimately rewarded based on the medals they win. While this is not \"unfair\", it pegs recognition to results rather than to effort, which is often tremendous when it comes to the amount athletes have to put in, especially in view of the fact that they could be pursuing more lucrative careers. Coming back to the monetary grant by the government, the size of the amount shows how sporting achievement is not on the same level as say, an actual occupation, even though athletes spend the same, if not more, amount of time training.\nSporting achievement is also often tied to national interests, and thus some athletes who do well in sports internationally are not recognised. Ben Davis'sdeferral which was rejected by the Ministry of Defence was based on the idea that his career is a personal pursuit, rather than for national glory. Again, this pragmatic and calculative approach simplifies what sporting achievement can mean in Singapore. If the word \"Singapore\" is not tagged to the achievement, it seems that it is not considered worthy. While being able to represent one'scountry is also what most athletes probably have in mind, the relationship should also go both ways. In Davis'scase, instead of rejoicing in the fact that a Singaporean is playing in the UK leagues, it was framed that he was simply playing for his personal interest. Ironically, the government has spared no expenses in \"importing\" foreign talents for the sake of earning more medals based on this idea that sporting achievement is valuable because the Singaporean brand name is on it.\nOverall, it is a vicious cycle: athletes are recognised only if they are extremely successful, but there is no support for them because there is little hope that they will be. The safer route is and will probably always be to pursue academics and skills rather than to pursue sports, because sports brings neither monetary rewards nor fame to athletes in the case of Singapore, and therefore sadly, there is much truth in the essay questions that sporting achievement is not adequately rewarded or recognized in my country."

                "text": "Benedict Anderson, a political scientist and historian, defined the nation as \"an imagined political community\" in his book Imagined Communities, a critical study of nationalism. Anderson believes nations as inherently limited and sovereign, and the word \"imagined\" suggests that it is a social construct. In fact, it is not only in the global age we inhabit that there is no justification for national boundaries – there has never been a need for such an idea if not for the desire of certain countries who use this construct for the purposes of conquest and territorial expansion. This essay will first examine how national boundaries came to be and are matters of construct, before critically examining its use in today'sglobal age.\nThe concept of a nation and national boundaries are such a matter of abstraction that they require definition. A nation is a group of culturally similar people who believe they belong together and deserve to govern themselves. It is not \"natural\" – people \"believe\" because they are taught and conditioned to do so. In school, we draw the national flag, say the national pledge; we celebrate National Day and we learn about our country'shistory. We do not personally know every other citizen of the same country, but when we recognise that we are indeed, from the same county, we feel a sense of solidarity. We support our country'steams at the Olympics and share in their glory; we get upset should other countries disrespect our sovereignty and allow their ships to enter national waters without permission.\nIt may also be important to consider its origins and the historical legacy of colonialism. National boundaries are concepts which originated from Europe, as a result of conflict, mostly the religious wars in the 16th-17th century. The Peace of Augsburg in 1555 and the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 were treaties which ushered in the notion of territorially sovereign states, and the concept continues to thrive because of them. The period of colonialism by European countries also led to the forceful imposition of such concepts in various places, whether Southeast Asia or Africa, where such concepts were not necessary before. In Africa, people were organised in small tribes and in fact, many of them continue to be. This is also why civil wars are aplenty – different tribes within the same sovereign state do not actually see themselves as part of the same country or entity. This is possibly why nationalism and the construction of national states have failed in so many places.\nThis unequal power structure reproduced by national boundaries continues to ring true for the global age in which we inhabit today. Firstly, national boundaries which are drawn have implications for migration. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), 59.5 million individuals around the world have been displaced involuntarily. What makes them displaced, however, is the concept of national boundaries. They are considered to be displaced only because they left the country of their origin, and are not welcome in another. While national borders are not particularly restrictive to the highly mobile, cosmopolitan parts of the population, those who are refugees are usually shunned as they are seen as unproductive and resource-grabbing. The often-raised question of \"Why are we providing them with housing etc. when they are not one of us?\" reveals the mentality of scarcity and how  citizens are conditioned to believe that the life of one of their own is more important to one not of their own.\nNational boundaries are also problematic for economic development. They are used for wealthier countries to suppress those which are less powerful. National boundaries restrict trade between countries, and some countries like America also impose tariffs on imports for particular industries in order to protect their own. While there are the ironically termed \"Free-Trade-Agreements\", they allow goods to flow freely only between countries which are part of the agreement, and often exemplify unequal balances of power between countries. The developing countries are made to open up their economies so that the wealthier can purchase their natural resources, but they may not be given the same kind of access to those of the developed thanks to protectionist policies. On the other hand, multinational companies which are footloose in their operations often have manufacturing in one country, research and development in another and their markets in another. These companies thus facilitate the flow of people, goods and resources across national boundaries, and countries suspend concepts of sovereignty in order to woo their investment.\nOverall, the concept of national boundaries are thus increasingly being challenged in the global age we are in, whether by the increasing prominence of cities or multinational companies. In China, being from Beijing would already distinguish one from someone from Shanghai. When Trump won the presidential elections, some in California suggested \"independence\". After all, national boundaries also vary in size. Some countries have up to a billion people, like China. Being \"imagined\", the larger they are in scale, the more fragile the common identity is. Cities have thus emerged as a more probable scale to construct a singular identity around.\nWhat we have thus is a world where national boundaries are used only to the advantage of those in power. In the past, sovereignty was used by colonial masters to justify conquest. Today,  it is reinforced by countries trying to keep out refugees. What has changed is that it is also used more selectively in our global age. It is invoked when it suits the countries\" interests, yet disregarded when countries want to attract multinational companies and talented manpower. National boundaries thus contribute to unequal outcomes for individuals and countries, and are not so easily justified in today'sworld."

                "prompt": "IN AN AGE OF RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT, IS A SINGLE CAREER FOR LIFE REALISTIC?",
                "text": "A recent LinkedIn survey found that if you are less than 32 years old, you are likely to change jobs at least four times before you reach that age. By 2001, only half of the workforce in the United Kingdom had been in continuous employment for a period longer than four years. Yet another survey by staffing firm Robert Half found that 64% of workers favour what is known as \"job-hopping\", particularly the younger generation, with 75% of employees under 34 believing in the benefits of job-hopping. A single career for life used to mean climbing the corporate ladder, stability in income and to a certain degree, specialisation. However, in an age of rapid technology advancement, how \"work\" is organised and what people feel about it have clearly changed. I believe that a single career for life, save for some professions and for some individuals, is no longer realistic nor desirable.\nThere is no doubt that, the age of rapid technological advancement has led to what is known as \"de-skilling\". Back in the 1930s, the term \"technological unemployment\" was coined by John Maynard Keynes as he forecasted how the ways in which we economise the use of labour would outpace the creation of uses for labour, leading to increases in unemployment. Original unskilled tasks filled by factory workers can be even further broken down, to be automated and performed by machines instead. Such technological innovations in manufacturing and communications have already led to rapid decreases in blue-collar, manufacturing jobs in many developed countries. It was estimated by Oxford professors Carl Benedikt Frey and Michael Osborne that 47 percent of American jobs are at risk of automation. Places like Hong Kong and Singapore have all experienced de-industrialisation, with many of those formerly employed in manufacturing being laid off as manufacturing jobs went to lower-cost countries like China or Vietnam. Instead, these economies have transitioned to service economies which require different skillsets. As such, governments have increasingly focused on re-training, or what is known as \"lifelong learning\". In Singapore, there is SkillsFuture Singapore which organises the SkillsFuture Credit, offering direct subsidies of S$500 to all Singaporean citizens so that they can gain new skills for new employment. Thus, while Keynes was right about how technology would change how labour is used, thankfully it has not led to widespread unemployment – even as jobs are lost, new jobs are also created. Instead, switching careers have become the norm in today'ssociety.\nHowever, there are some exceptions to this. For a start, while technological advancement is more rapid than ever before, people may not be displaced from their jobs, particularly if tacit skills and experience are still important. For example, while many advances have been made in the optometric industry, the skills of experienced optometrists are still extremely valued, and even more valued with regard to the operation of the new technology. Thus, those holding jobs disrupted by technology may not be completely replaced. Instead, they may pick up how to operate these new technology, and benefit from a skills upgrade without switching their careers. Another example is how increasingly, policing has involved technology with regards to surveillance and data analytics. However, policing still requires police officers to act on such information. Thus, for many occupations, they will not actually require people to switch careers. Those who believe in this argument thus call the process \"en-skilling\" instead of \"de-skilling\".\nOn the other hand, technological advancement is also not only forcing individuals to change jobs, but also allowing them to juggle multiple careers at the same time. The \"gig economy\" is the term for this new phenomenon. The gig economy or sharing economy allows people to make use of technology to optimise the use of their resources, whether tangible like car seats or intangible like time and creativity. Grab and Youtube are two classic examples of empowering individuals to have another side job that can become as well-paying as their mainstream job. These sharing platforms – whether to share car rides or to share videos – allow people to make a market from their skills. As P.J. Abdul Kalam said, \"the youth today need to be enabled to become job generators from job seekers.\" This is also necessarily a negative trend because having multiple careers empower individuals to do what they actually enjoy and are passionate about. Leaving the typical nine-to-five working lifestyle for a freelancing manner of getting employment has become increasingly more popular amongst young people, with over half of workers below 24 in France, Germany, Italy and Spain on fixed-term contracts rather than the traditional long term ones. Loyalty to companies is also less important to individuals who want job flexibility and autonomy over the jobs they do. Thus, technological advancement which has opened up the possibilities for flexible and new jobs has made young people consider job satisfaction and autonomy to be more important than job stability. As the saying goes, \"If you do what you love, you never have to work for a day\". It seems that the younger generation today are particularly believers of this.\nOf course, there are again exceptions, particularly for those who commit themselves to a particular skill or sport. David Beckham once said that \"I treat my job as a hobby. It'ssomething I love doing.\"  For those highly passionate about their choice of employment, a single career is probably the only thing they can envision themselves doing. After all, for particular occupations, more years really do mean becoming better at the job. Other than athletes who will not benefit from switching sports every two years should they want to be at the top of their game, other occupations which require years of dedication include those which are artisanal in nature. For example, leather crafters or tailors are people whose skills get refined over time, making them better at the job as they stay in the career longer. These are also jobs which fundamentally defy technological disruption. A good sportsman is considered good precisely because he is meant to stretch the potential of what a human can do, rather than being aided by machines. Art and artisanal products are precious and valued because they are made by people and thus unique, rather than being standardised and mass produced. Hence, there is still a place for these careers in our economy, and these careers, when performed by the very best and the committees, usually span a lifetime.\nUltimately, the idea of work and how work is done are always undergoing changes. Save for a few, a single career is not only unrealistic, but also unfulfilling and unproductive. Instead of trying to force oneself to commit to a single career, it is more important that people find work meaningful for themselves as well as for society – whether in a single career or multiple ones."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT IS THE PURSUIT OF CONTINUOUS ECONOMIC GROWTH A DESIRABLE GOAL?",
                "text": "The modern concept of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) only came into existence in 1934, but today it is something that every country uses as the benchmark for success. Since then, there have only been more indicators to understand how a country'seconomy is growing, whether in terms of net exports, foreign direct investment or remittances. There is probably no dispute that economic growth is desirable especially when it is accompanied by human development, but several drawbacks have been identified when economic growth is pursued at all costs, including external environmental costs and increasing income inequality. Nonetheless, we cannot neglect the fact that the sustainability of economic growth itself is tied to social and environmental sustainability, and thus if continuous economic growth is to be pursued in its truest sense, it will be, to a large extent, desirable for society and the world.\nIt must first be understood that economic growth is actually a proxy for people'swell-being. It is assumed that the higher the level of economic growth, the more income people have in order to have better lives, in terms of material goods and services they can consume, such as healthcare and food. Thus, economic growth is often closely correlated with improvements in life expectancies and literacy levels while decreasing incidences of diseases or even crime. In China, more than 500 million people have been lifted out of extreme poverty since its economy started opening up from the 1980s, with a simultaneous 8.6 years increase in life expectancy. The countries with the highest levels of Human Development Index (HDI), which measures life expectancy and literacy rates, are also highly correlated with high economic growth. The Newly Industrializing Economies of the 1980s, or better known as the \"Four Asian Tigers\" including Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea, are all examples of how economic growth went hand in hand with improvements in people'swell-being. There are of course some countries which have not followed the same path due to a lack of investment from economic growth into development, such as Nigeria, which despite being the largest economy in Africa, also has the greatest concentration of poverty, with its HDI at 152 out of 188 countries. Nonetheless, economic growth is still largely a prerequisite for resources to be channeled to development in the first place.\nHowever, while it has been argued by proponents of trickle-down economics that economic growth is good for everyone in the economy, economic growth is increasingly being held as the culprit for increasing income inequality and thus social injustice. How economic growth leads to increasing income inequality is posited to be through the increasing accumulation and concentration of capital by the wealthy. The growth pole theory supports this – rich people and rich areas have more resources to get even richer. This has also been observed on the regional level. In China, cities on the coast are growing much faster than those inland, and the disparities between urban and rural areas have been observed, with rural residents earning less than a third of the average per capita income of urban residents. Many other well-developed countries and cities, including Singapore and Hong Kong, are facing this issue. However, in a study examining economic inequality, it is discovered that economic growth does not have a direct correlation with income inequality. It is rather the policies put in place which affect the pathways in which economic growth contributes to, or mitigates, income inequality. Countries like Nigeria which are wealthy but do not invest in education and welfare lag behind, but many wealthy countries such as Sweden do see much lower income inequality. Thus, the blame lies not in continuous economic growth, but rather on inequitable policies.\nLastly, economic growth has been painted as the main driver of climate change problems, and this is for good reason. The rapid industrialization which led to exponential economic growth also caused an exponential increase in carbon emissions, driving our world towards ecological doom. And developing countries which wish to continue to grow their economy are going to follow in the footsteps of developed ones through generating carbon emissions as they power their manufacturing plants and burn fossil fuels. Other environmental harm is also caused in the process of generating economic growth, such as pollution of water bodies by manufacturing plants, the destruction of biodiversity due to overfishing and oil spills. However, there is a sliver of hope amidst all this doom and gloom – the concept of decoupling economic growth from fossil fuels is growing to promote green growth, which is economic growth that is also environmentally sustainable. For example, there has been increasing investment in renewable energy such as solar energy, particularly in developing places like Africa. Under the New Deal on Energy, more and more of the continent'sinvestment into energy infrastructure have been directed towards solar energy projects, which will emit less carbon emissions while still powering the economy. Hence, continuous economic growth, coupled with proper environmental policies, is needed and desirable for further development.\nYet, it is also crucial to note that income inequality and environmental issues both threaten the continuity of economic growth in turn. The former causes social instability which can lead to the collapse of regimes such as seen during Arab Spring, while the latter can also threaten it, as it causes disruptions to food supply or destroy existing infrastructure. In fact, with most economic activities concentrated on coastal cities around the world, coastal flooding and sea level rises will pose a huge threat to economic growth in those regions and the world. Thus, even for those who agree that economic growth must remain a priority, it must also happen in tandem with more equitable distribution as well as environmental protection. This is not impossible, as shown previously, through far-sighted and balanced policies.\nUltimately, economic growth is desirable because human well-being is desirable. It is thus hopeful that as humanity has learnt lessons on how economic growth, if unchecked, can threaten our initial goals, that it is important to choose a different path where all three kinds of sustainability – economic, social and environmental – are emphasized. This is why, if taken to the true sense of the word, continuous economic growth will be desirable, since it will also have to be sustainable."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS FAILURE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF SUCCESS?",
                "text": "Robert T. Kiyosaki, famous inspirational speaker and successful businessman once said that \"failure is part of the process of success. People who avoid failure also avoid success.\" In today'ssociety where everyone wants to be a winner, the notion of failure being an essential part of success needs particular re-emphasis precisely because it sounds so counter-intuitive. Today, it seems that nobody wants to fail but everyone wants to succeed. But we have to recognize that failure is so important to success because it not only helps one to develop skills necessary for success, but also makes success more meaningful to the person who has attained it.\nFor a start, failure helps one to learn how to repeat mistakes and develop skills for necessary success. Getting a mathematics question wrong will allow one to see whether one has keyed in the wrong values in the calculator, or used the wrong formula. It is the rigorous process of failing, of checking where one has failed and of making the necessary corrections that will allow one to succeed in the future. For someone like Henry Ford who quipped that \"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently\", he went bankrupt twice while trying to start his automobile business, which he did ultimately succeed in. Each time he failed, he identified the reason and made improvements. For example, in the manufacturing of Model T (the first Ford model), after repeated failed attempts, he finally managed to reduce assembly time from 14 hours to about 90 minutes, dramatically cutting costs and increasing the viability of his business. Similarly, for Michael Jordan, who was told he was not good enough for the school'steam, failure was overcome by seeing it as a potential for improvement. He trained harder, improved where his coach thought he lacked in, and became one of the world'sbest basketball players, proving his coach'sinitial judgement wrong. These examples are but a few of the numerous that show us how failure is often the path to future and greater success.\nFord'sexample is also linked to how true success is often based on going where no one has gone before, whether it is innovating a new technology or trying out a new business model. Thomas Edison'slightbulb is a classic example of how failure is essential for success. If one is merely repeating what others have done before then, failure can be avoided; but then true success will never be attained. Failure is thus almost to be expected. Going to the moon took several failures as well, with three astronauts dying in a fire when the rocket failed to launch in the first attempt. Each failure contributed to a change in the way the entire endeavour was designed. For example, the death of the astronauts prompted a major redesign of the capsule. Ultimately, success was attained when Neil Armstrong made a successful moon landing. His landing was not a one-off success, but rather an accumulation of experiences, trial and error, and of course, failures. It can thus be seen that anything innovative in this world must have taken several failures before they can fully materialise and be successful.\nBesides, failure not only allows one to improve in terms of skills specific to one'sgoals, but also develops one'scharacter which is crucial to success. Characteristics like grit, resilience and determination are developed through accepting and making the best out of failure. Many people fail not just for a particular moment, but for an extended period of time, which further tests their resilience. A noteworthy example would be J.K. Rowling who was living on welfare and suffered from her mother'sdeath, a miscarriage and an abusive marriage for seven years after leaving university before the Harry Potter series was published. However, it was also during these seven years that Rowling continuously worked on Harry Potter. Being a \"failure\" did not stop her from trying to achieve success, which she eventually did.\nInterestingly, failure is also an essential part of success even after one has succeeded. As Ellen DeGeneres puts it, \"It'sfailure that gives you the proper perspective on success.\". Someone who has never failed before will take success for granted, as if it is a given. These are the people who will not be able to maintain success for long, akin to wealthy heirs who never knew how difficult it is to earn money and thus squander all their inheritance away. The example of Steve Jobs can help to illustrate this. Jobs was pretty successful until he got ousted from his company by the other stakeholders, making him question if he was a good leader before that. Luckily for Jobs, this was not the end for him, and he quickly bounced back and ultimately regained control of his company again, taking it to greater heights. After this failure, Jobs would never take his success for granted again, for he knows its precarity. This understanding of its precarity also makes success taste sweeter and that much more precious, illustrating how the experience of past failures can contribute to a richer sense of success in future. This appreciation of one'spast failures also makes those who are successful more giving. Coming back to the example of J.K. Rowling, due to her own experiences being in poverty, she gave back to charity tremendously when she became the world'sfirst billionaire author, specifically contributing to anti-poverty and children welfare causes.\nIn summary, failure is indubitably an essential part of success, considering how it is not only inevitable but can be constructive for one'ssuccess. Being afraid of, or avoiding, failure can ironically prevent one from accessing true success. It is then of no wonder that people who have failed then succeeded do not mind sharing about their past failures, because they truly believe that ultimately it is their failures which have helped them get to where they are today."

                "prompt": "HOW EFFECTIVE ARE PRISONS IN ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF CRIME?",
                "text": "In the words of Michel Foucault, a French intellectual, prison is \"but a recruitment center for the army of crime.\" In a time when citizens are increasingly questioning the effectiveness of the criminal justice system and recidivism rates are on the rise, it is necessary to question the effectiveness of imprisonment in mitigating crime. Whether incarceration is successful in eradicating crime thus rests on whether it successfully reforms criminals and whether the act of imprisonment promotes crime in communities in the long term. With these criteria in mind, it can be argued that prisons are only effective in addressing the problem of crime if prison sentences are able to address the root causes of the crime, if resources are diverted to rehabilitation, if prisons maintain a small critical size to prevent the growth of criminal networks, and if prisons are able to mitigate the impact that mass incarceration has on communities.\nPrisons are only able to effectively reform criminals and lower the rates of recidivism if the prison sentence is able to address the root causes of the crime. At first glance, it appears that prisons have failed to prevent convicts from reoffending. According to the National Institute of Justice, about 68 percent of prisoners released in the United States were arrested for a new felony within 3 years, and 77 percent were arrested within 5 years. However, a detailed breakdown of recidivism rates reveals that imprisonment can be effective in rehabilitating criminals, but only if the prison sentence was commensurate to the nature of the crime. Sex offenders and domestic abusers tend to benefit the most from short-term prison sentences, which act to \"convince the offender that unlawful conduct has serious consequences\". Sex offenders have a recidivism rate of 28.4 percent in the United States, as compared to a 62.7 percent recidivism rate for drug offenders, for instance. The disparity in effectiveness can be attributed to the nature of the crimes – jail time is able to dissuade sex offenders from reoffending, but is unable to address more pernicious problems like drug addiction, or unaddressed economic needs which push people into drug peddling, for example.\nWhen prisons focus on rehabilitation, however, they are seen to be more effective in reducing the re-offense rate, regardless of the nature of the crime. After the Singapore Prison Service introduced the Rehabilitation Framework and the Level of Service Inventory-Revised instrument to match inmates to correctional programmes based on their rehabilitation needs and criminogenic risks, as well as established a Prison School in 2000, Singapore'srecidivism rate dipped from 44.4 percent for the 1998 release cohort to 27.3 percent for the 2008 release cohort. In contrast, the American criminal justice system is characterised by a \"for-profit\" prison system which limits inmates\" access to education and nutrition, and therefore unsurprisingly boasts the highest reoffense rate in the world at 76 percent. Evidently, prisons are only effective in reforming their inmates if efforts go towards rehabilitative rather than retributive justice.\nAdditionally, if prisons are able to reduce recidivism and control the size of prison populations, they are likely to be more successful in preventing the growth of criminal networks based in prisons. Prison gangs and criminal networks often arise as a rational response to poor conditions within burdened prison systems – the Californian prison system has about 160,000 inmates, and on average holds a few thousand in each prison. In such a system, there is a large black market for illicit goods, and understaffed prison administrations are unable to provide law and order. This creates the conditions for the growth of prison gangs like the notorious Mexican Mafia, which control life both inside and outside these prisons. In contrast, the Scandinavian prison systems minimize the number of inmates held in each facility, and have reported lower occurrences of criminal organisations fomenting within prisons.\nAt the same time, it must be noted that incarceration often drastically changes communities in ways which might foment crime in the long-term. Prisons will only be effective in preventing crime if they cooperate with external agencies to address the effects of imprisonment on the community. Studies have shown that the children of incarcerated parents tend to move frequently, face financial problems from a young age, struggle with emotional and family instability. Communities with high levels of mass incarceration tend to perpetuate that cycle since incarceration disrupts important social and family structures and roles. Partners which provide support services, such as the Kids in Play programme run by the Salvation Army in Singapore, are able to mitigate these impacts and break the cycle of violence and crime.\nIn conclusion, prisons are only effective in combating crime if they are able to address the root causes of crime, if sufficient resources are diverted to counselling convicts and preparing them for a life outside prison, and if they are able to prevent the agglomeration of criminal networks. This is because their effectiveness should be evaluated in terms of whether they are able to prevent crime from occurring in the long-term. With the right support for criminals who have demonstrated the ability to turn over a new leaf, prisons will be able to prevent crime for good, as criminals are often pushed to reoffend if they are unable to meet their social or economic needs after leaving prison. This often has a positive impact on communities, who may be left with a \"social vacuum\" if convicts are not rehabilitated and the impact of mass incarceration is not mitigated. If prisons are able to prevent the growth of criminal networks, they will be better able to prevent the vicious cycle of crime from perpetuating itself."

Except the same quote could be applied to explain why developed western nations even bother with foreign aid, but for far less altruistic reasons. Foreign aid is not always given with the most compassionate of agendas, as the various parties in the process (save for the actual intended recipients of it)—from the governments that give the aid, to the leaders of the aid-receiving countries—having their own designs on them. All of these result in little to no improvement in the lives of those who so desperately need this aid. Sometimes, aid may even exacerbate the situation for the recipients. As such, global aid does not always improve and sometimes even worsens the lives of those who need it the most.\nOn a governmental level, it may appear as though leaders of developed nations provide global aid for solely humanitarian and altruistic purposes. But this is not necessarily true. More often than not, aid is carefully and rationally calculated. Contrary to popular belief, aid is a trade for policy masquerading as charity and is made between leaders for their own intentions.  For the aid-giving countries, their motive for giving aid could be to influence the aid-recipient to act in a way that benefits them, politically or economically. These conditionalities attached to the aid makes donor countries focus too much on the commercial advancement of their country instead of what the recipients need. In the United Kingdom, the Overseas Development Administration (ODA) allegedly granted aid connected to the achievement of foreign policy goals or British companies winning export orders. The scandal concerned was about a hydroelectric dam on Pergau River in Malaysia which was funded by the UK foreign aid budget in 1991. In return, the Malaysian government bought around £1 billion worth of arms from the UK. On another occasion, in 1995, the World Bank promised loans to Mozambique if it cut its export tariffs on raw nuts in an attempt to open up its economy. Not long after, the country'sonce-thriving nut industry was in the doldrums, leaving 10,000 people out of work. U.S. Representative Howard Berman once mentioned, \"Aid is not a gift. The United States provides foreign assistance because it serves our interests.\" It is painfully clear that tied aid is designed to benefit the donors and not the recipients, with no improvement to the lives of those who are actually in need of it.\nHowever, selfish as aid may be, the idea of rendering aid to develop other countries to prevent their problems from reaching us may be incentive enough for aid to be effective and actually help those who need it. Bill and Melinda Gates recounted such concepts in their Annual Letter 2019, discussing how countries like the United States invest in foreign aid because it increases stability abroad and security at home, that is if the aid provided does produce results. Examining the recent Ebola outbreak, strengthening global healthcare systems decreases the chances of a deadly pathogen like Ebola becoming a global epidemic. Improving the education and safety abroad keeps people from leaving their countries to seek better lives elsewhere and could help in the long-term in alleviating the migrant crisis happening in many of these aid-donor countries, like the US and Europe. This new mindset change towards solving problems in other countries to prevent them from reaching us has led to a paradigm shift in the aid industry, from being humanitarian to be results-driven. This idea is echoed in Raj Kumar'snew book, \"The Business of Changing the World: How Billionaires, Tech Disrupters, and Social Entrepreneurs Are Transforming the Global Aid Industry\", where Kumar writes that the aid industry has transformed from one organized around good intentions to one with competition for good results. And this is good news for the aid recipients. At last, donors are actually trying to make an impact instead of being driven by their own ulterior motives. In the past, aid was often given without consideration to people'sactual needs as outsiders assumed they knew what they needed. For example, following the 2004 Indian Ocean Earthquake, Sri Lanka'sforeign minister reportedly said that the aid coming in, despite the goodwill, was \"not very useful\", as it included containers full of teddy bears and rice when the country was expecting a bumper harvest. But with the transforming of the aid industry itself, we could see less of such incidents occurring in the future, with recipients\" lives being improved in a tangible sense.\nYet, another major obstacle in foreign aid really impacting the lives of those in need are the very governments in charge of the aid-receiving countries. In many of these developing countries, corruption is rife and dishonest leaders would siphon the funds meant to help their countrymen for their own gain. A prime example of this is South Africa'spresident, Jacob Zuma, who spent a whopping US$16 million to do \"security updates\" to his house. In actuality, he had built a new swimming pool on his property and called it a \"fire protection device\", when the funds used for the project could have gone to help the South African community. Yet this preposterous situation is not a standalone case, as such cases are widely prevalent across the developing world. In Nepal, which suffers from poor governance and endemic corruption, the delivery of aid was delayed following the Gorkha Earthquake that hit the country in 2015. Isolated villages high up in the Himalayas were yet to be reached three weeks after the initial quake, increasing the potential for more deaths. Its reputation of corruption has also deterred aid, as donors are less willing to donate, ultimately impacting the innocent people affected by the quake. In this way, corrupt governments of aid-receiving countries inhibit the delivery of aid, using the resources for their own private benefit instead, which winds up hurting the people who actually need the aid.\nOn a societal level, excessive long-term aid can be damaging to the accountability systems of the country and cause a crutch mentality to develop. Whilst long-term aid in the aspects of education and healthcare can drastically improve the local systems, the reliance on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and external parties to deliver essential services to the community can reduce trust and power in the government. Moreover, since aid is fundamentally different from taxes, in that they do not come from people'sown pockets, they are less likely to demand accountability from the government, letting corruption slide and adopting a fatalistic attitude to the state of affairs of the country. The over-dependence on the private aid sector to deliver is exemplified in Nepal where the high incidence of corruption has led foreign aid funds to flow into NGOs and not the government, resulting in a brain drain in its civil service as civil servants leave the government sector to work for the better-funded private aid industry. This could pose a problem for the country in the long-term as the aid industry has to exit one day. On the difference between aid and taxes, behavioural economics indicates that people react differently to money that they perceive to be theirs, and money that they perceive to belong to others. A study by the University of Toronto and Chicago in which two groups of factory workers in China were given the same 80 yuan bonus, except that the first group was told that the bonus would be taken back if they failed to produce 10 units more of goods, while the second group was told they would be given the bonus afterwards if they produced 10 units more of goods. The results were surprising as one would expect given the same conditions, workers would work the same, yet the first group worked harder than the second. This effect is due to loss aversion, which would account for the nonchalant attitudes many people in the developing world have towards corruption cases since they do not pay taxes and the funds embezzled are coming from foreign aid. They simply do not care since the money is not theirs, and hence demand less accountability from the government. In the long-run, this could be detrimental for the governance of the country as leaders have more freedom, allowing them to act in selfish ways without the risk of being voted out of office by the public. It is thus evident that over-dependence on foreign aid can have long-term consequences on the economy and political state of countries.\nIn conclusion, while the aid industry is reshaping to be more results-driven to have real impacts on people who need it the most, it remains motivated by the selfish gains of the leaders giving and receiving the aid who each have their own agendas. Ultimately, the ones who do not stand to benefit and even suffer from these transactions are those who so desperately need the aid. While the current state of affairs for foreign aid may seem bleak, the shift in the aid ministry to compete for good results instead of mere good intentions may hopefully alleviate the situation, bringing us closer to solving the problems plaguing the needy."

                "prompt": "\"INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY IS ALWAYS A DESIRABLE GOAL.\" DO YOU AGREE?",
                "text": "\"Kodokushi\", meaning \"lonely death\" in Japanese, is the phenomenon of elderly people dying alone and remaining undiscovered for a relatively long time. The remains are usually discovered after some time due to the putrid smell of decomposition or administrative officers finally checking up on them for overdue bills. Such is the fate of the greying population in Japan, and it is far from being an isolated case with similar incidents being reported in Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. The morbidity and grim nature of this sad reality forces us to reconsider the goal of increasing life expectancy, which is a highly sought after goal across nations both developed and developing. While there are certainly personal and economic benefits to having the elderly around for longer, there are also costs in those very aspects as well. Philosophically, an endless life may also render life meaningless. Altogether, these may make the goal of increasing life expectancy less desirable and pushes us to ponder if a short but meaningful life may be better.\nIn an economic sense, many countries chase after higher life expectancy as a cumulative indicator of societal welfare. Higher life expectancy usually correlates with better healthcare and has even been associated with the gross domestic product (GDP) of a country in various studies. The Preston Curve relates life expectancy to per capita income, providing the link between the two. Sitting atop the rankings is Hong Kong with a life expectancy of 84.2 years as of 2016. The special autonomous region also prides itself with one of the highest GDP per capita in Asia, being one of the four Asian tigers to undergo rapid industrialization and economic growth from the 1950s to 1990s. Healthcare in Hong Kong is also known to be one of the most efficient with 11 private and 42 public hospitals to serve a population of just over 7 million. On the other hand, Sierra Leone, the West African nation, has one of the world'slowest life expectancies of a mere 51.8 years as of 2016. Its GDP per capita is barely 500 USD, with rampant poverty, lack of access to clean water and poor sanitation. It was dubbed \"one of the worst places on Earth to access healthcare\", with infant and maternal mortality rates being one of the highest in the world.  As such, it is no wonder that countries would strive for higher life expectancy as the indicator represents the overall welfare of citizens in terms of material and non-material standards of living.\nWhile higher life expectancy may prove that social welfare is improving, it is also the cause of the strain on the government'shealthcare infrastructure, putting additional financial burden on both the state and the workforce. With an ageing population, more public healthcare services would have to be provided in terms of hospitals, doctors and medical equipment. This will cause the government'sbudget to rise in order to provide the aforementioned services, which will lead to a combination of a national deficit and increased taxes on the working population. This problem has already begun to crop up in countries like Singapore, Japan and Australia who sit on top of the life expectancy rankings. Singapore is starting to feel the strain, with 4.7 citizens of working age for every 1 older adult in a study by population.sg in 2016. This figure is projected to drop to 2.3 by 2030, indicating that the responsibility of caring for a larger ageing population will fall on the shoulders of a much smaller younger workforce. In addition to labour shortages, the ageing population brings with them increased healthcare costs from health screenings, treatments, hospitalisation and medicine. The Singapore government has also recently unveiled the Merdeka Generation Package in the 2019 Budget, aimed at citizens born in the 1950s, to provide them with better peace of mind over future healthcare costs. This comes after the Community Health Assistance Scheme (CHAS) and Pioneer Generation Package were rolled out just a few years ago. These packages and schemes may seem beneficial for society, providing financial support to the aged, yet it will put a disproportionate amount of stress on the republic'sfinances. A budget deficit of $3.4 billion is predicted for the financial year of 2019 with the total healthcare spending amounting to $11.7 billion. This is in contrast to the $4 billion allocated for healthcare in 2010, over the span of less than a decade this figure has nearly tripled. It is evident that longer life expectancy will put a strain on the government'spublic health systems and national finances, causing it to be less than desirable.\nOn a personal level, however, a longer life gives people more time to experience the joys of life, like pursuing a lifelong passion or spending time with friends and family. With today'ssociety being so fast-paced, and with studies and work occupying a large proportion of our time before retirement, a longer life gives us the time to chase after the things that truly matter in life, be it fulfilment from pursuing one'spassions or quality time with loved ones. This is grounded on the premise that the meaning of life is derived from diverse experiences and memories. With a longer runway, those who live longer have more opportunities to indulge in these experiences. Additionally, a longer lifetime enables people to contribute to society more. Take the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart who died at the tender age of 35. His greatest works include \"Eine Kleine Nachtmusik\" and \"Rondo Alla Turca\" which are widely enjoyed and studied by many even till today, more than 200 years after they were first composed. Had he lived a longer life, he would have undoubtedly been able to contribute many more great classical pieces to mankind. It is clear that longer life expectancy gives us the chance to experience a happier and more meaningful life all while contributing more to society.\nThat said, a longer life does not necessarily equate to a more meaningful life, as many people spend their twilight years battling debilitating diseases, live in loneliness or even having to work till the very last second just to feed themselves. The 2017 Global Burden of Disease Study found that while global life expectancy is 73 years, that of healthy life expectancy is only 63, meaning that on average, people spend 10 years living in less than ideal health. This concept of years living in less than ideal health is succinctly captured in \"Years Lived with Disability (YLDs)\". In other words, while one may technically live a longer life, it may not be any better as the years spent living with a disease, living on medication on a daily basis, shuttling between home and the hospital or even hospitalized for long periods are much worse. Loneliness is also another factor that could significantly reduce the quality of life for the aged, as they may not have friends or family to rely on. As discussed earlier, \"kodokushi\" in Japan is a phenomenon that was borne out of the rising life expectancy coupled with several other factors. Many of the victims of \"kodokushi\" are corporate workers who did not have many friends or family outside of work. Retirement, instead of giving them time to live a more fulfilling life, plunged them into isolation as they were removed from the corporate world. The loneliness and despair could have played a role leading up to their eventual deaths, with no one caring enough to visit them in life or death. The elderly poor are also subject to a lower quality of life as they have to work tirelessly, often in menial jobs just to make ends meet. This is particularly prevalent in South Korea, where elderly poor will \"work until they die\". They say, \"I\"ll take care of myself as long as I can … then I\"ll go to the hospital and die.\" Some scour the streets to pick up recyclables and waste paper, lugging some 100 kilograms of waste for a whole day to the junk depot in exchange for less than 10,000 KRW. Others work in less savoury jobs as elderly prostitutes known as \"Bacchus ladies\", soliciting in parks and plazas for a measly pay as well. South Korea sure sits near the top of life expectancy rankings at 82.7 years, but the bitter fates that more than half of the elderly population endures raises the question if it is a fate worse than death. Thus, it is painfully obvious that long bitter lives spent in ill health, isolation and hardship may be even worse than death.\nTaking a more philosophical approach, living forever would be meaningless in the long run. Death, paradoxically, gives life the meaning which we all seek. The literal deadline gives urgency to everything we do in life, forcing us to work with a sense of purpose, perhaps to leave behind a legacy, something that is again only possible in death. The hypothetical proposition of eternal life would bore us to death and cause Man to lapse into laziness, cynicism and self-servitude. On the contrary, the fact that we will only exist on this Earth for a mere couple of decades motivates us to live with more drive and zeal, rather than whiling our time away. Acts of nobility, self-sacrifice and creativity are borne out of the knowledge that our time here is finite. In this way, increasing life expectancy taken to the extreme is undesirable and life would be forfeited of any meaning.\nIn essence, while increased life expectancy may indicate healthy economic growth and good public welfare systems for the nation, it also puts pressure on those very systems, creating a plethora of problems for the national economy. On a personal level, though it affords us the chance to live a more fulfilling and meaningful life, it is also capable of making life more miserable than death. Moreover, philosophically, an endless life would be meaningless. Perhaps, if we lived shorter lives more saturated in meaning instead, fewer of us will end up dying alone and decomposing in our own filth."

                "prompt": "DO YOU AGREE THAT GOOD PARENTING IS INCREASINGLY CHALLENGING IN YOUR SOCIETY TODAY?",
                "text": "What makes a good parent? People have grappled with this question for generations because good parents make a good family, and good families make good societies. As the world changes and evolves constantly, the ways that parents parent their children have evolved in tandem. But is it harder to be a parent today than in the past? Some might argue that with the increase in parenting education self-help resources on the Internet for new parents, parenting is easier today. Financial assistance from the government is also readily available for parents and their families who need it. Yet in spite of this, parents today continue to lament that it is more difficult today than in the past with some chalking it up to longer working hours and others blaming the omnipresent mass media. I would agree that on balance, good parenting in my society, Singapore, is more challenging today than ever before.\nSome argue that parents today have it easier than when their parents were raising them because of the various government policies in place currently to help couples on their journey to parenthood. Having all kinds of bonuses and grants reduces the financial burden on new parents which can allow them to focus on parenting without worrying too much about finances. Some of these schemes include the Baby Bonus Scheme with a cash gift of up to S$2,000, as well as the Child Development Account, which is a special savings account for children with added benefits of up to S$18,000 to be spent on approved uses. These financial assistance schemes from the government certainly do help defray the cost of raising a child, at least in the first few years of his or her life. The benefits have been revised over the years to provide more financial help to parents and we could expect more of such revisions. Certainly, such social welfare benefits were not available to parents less than two decades ago. Half a century ago, parents from the working class, especially those who were not as highly educated, had to work multiple odd jobs just to get by and raise their children, and financial help from the then newly set-up government were far and few in between. In this way, parenting today, at least providing for children in terms of their physical needs, may be easier than before.\nMoreover, it can be argued that with the Internet in today'sworld, information and resources are much more readily available for parents to guide them in various aspects of parenting. At the core, providing for children'sphysical needs is the most basic job of a parent. What then sets good parents apart? The Internet believes it has the answers, with a plethora of articles, blogs and forums to help nervous parents at every stage in parenting, to be the good parents all parents strive to be. Sites like \"Serious about Preschool\" for parents of preschool-age children and \"KiasuParents\" for parents of school-going children aged up to 18 years old—the Internet has it all. These resources include professional insights from industry experts on enrichment classes for toddlers to \"How to be your teen'sbest friend\". There are also forums for fellow parents to exchange tips and tricks and forge a sense of community. At just a click of mouse, parents will be thoroughly educated on how to be the best parent for their child. This is a stark contrast to the past where such resources were scarce and hard to find. Now, with the rise of the Internet age, these pillars of support are more easily accessible to parents of the modern world. As such, given the abundance of parenting resources, it can be claimed that it is less challenging to be a good parent today than in the past.\nYet despite all these improvements, parents still lament that it is harder today than ever before. And they have reason to believe so. As the Singaporean economy develops, the lines between work and private life have blurred and parents have less time to spend with their children, which is especially important in a child'sformative years. A 2015 global statistics found that Singaporeans work an average of 45.6 hours a week, which is the second highest in the developed world. This, while not startling, is concerning for parents who have to struggle with long hours at work and raising children. As National University Singapore (NUS) sociologist Tan Ern Ser pointed out, working long hours and being mentally occupied with work lead to less quality time with family members, especially those who need attention the most. Even when parents are physically present, they may still mentally be at work. This effect can be attributed to the rise of mobile devices, making work more portable than ever. Dr Walter Theseira from Singapore University of Social Sciences also notes that employees are expected to reply work emails and read work documents on mobile phones even after work hours. This further skews the work-life balance, allowing work to pervade into our private lives, making it harder to parent children. Clearly, juggling work and raising children at the same time is a feat in itself, making good parenting harder in the modern world.\nAnother reason that parenting may be harder today than ever is the existence of the omnipresent mass media which directly promotes ideas that parents may not approve of. As discussed in the previous paragraph, due to parents being mentally absent, parents usually toss some form of a mobile device, usually a mobile phone or tablet to young children to pacify them. In an instant, children'swails and cries are silenced by the brightly coloured screens that captivate their attention. While parents might love this quick fix solution, it could prove to have long-lasting repercussions unbeknownst to them. When parents set children'sentertainment like \"Finger Family Song\" or \"Surprise Egg\" reveals to play on YouTube, they usually do not realise the autoplay function on the platform which allows related videos to stream continuously. The creators of these videos have realised this function though and some of them have exploited this function by algorithmically creating mashups of familiar cartoon characters in violent situations. James Bridle, an artist and writer dealing primarily with technology, knowledge and the end of the future, examined this issue in his TED Talk entitled \"The nightmare of childrens\" YouTube\". He notes that these videos \"exploit and terrify young minds\". In our world today, where parents toss their children down the spiral of mutated, terrifying cartoons, it is hard to argue that parents today are good parents at all. For older kids, themes of sex, violence and substance abuse are promoted repetitively in the mass media as risk-free, harmless and even cool. These ideas typically do not align with what most parents would advocate in their families, yet children are constantly exposed to such material, perhaps due to parents\" negligence in monitoring what their children watch. Evidently, good parenting today is more difficult due to the dangers that threaten children'ssafety lurking everywhere online.\nDespite all that have been discussed, the most crucial question has yet to be addressed: What is good parenting? As times change, expectations of parents have evolved in tandem. Parents in the past could get away with a laidback child-rearing approach in line with the slower pace of living of the time, yet that same parenting style applied today would never fly. Parents today are expected to be more involved in their children'slives, especially in their academics. This rings true for many young Singaporean children who have had to grow up under \"tiger mums\" and \"helicopter parents\". Parents today take on multiple hats for their children, including chauffeuring their children from enrichment class after enrichment class and being a personal tutor who monitors children do homework. It is clear that the very definition of a good parent has radically changed. While it is easy to pin the blame on overly competitive parents for piling enrichment classes, assessment books and stress on their young children, we must first examine the situation from the parents\" perspectives. Parents face more stress than ever to birth valedictorians, scholars or just successful (by society'sdefinition) children. This can be attributed to the abundance of parenting resources, discussed earlier, that tell parents they have to do this or do that or else they are not providing the very best for their children and that they are \"bad parents\". This causes parents to act in adverse ways, transferring the pressure on them to be \"good parents\" unto their children to be \"successful\". Therefore, with the bar to be a \"good parent\" set so ridiculously high, who can safely claim to be a \"good parent\"?\nTo conclude, good parenting is hard to define but the standard to be considered a good parent has undoubtedly been raised over the past few decades. Parents now also have to wrestle with the mass media that threatens to corrupt their children'sminds, while juggling longer work hours at the same time. It certainly is a feat to raise children today but other parties like the government and the Internet have offered some consolation in the arduous road of parenthood. The Internet'sready abundance of parenting resources and forums would definitely prove useful to parents at every stage, while the government'sliberal financial help to defray the cost of raising children certainly help alleviate the factor of cost, associated with raising children here in the most expensive city in the world. Despite these, it must be admitted that good parenting in Singapore is indeed more challenging today than ever before."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT DOES SOCIAL MEDIA POSE A CHALLENGE FOR THE GOVERNMENT?",
                "text": "The expansion of online social networking has given citizens unprecedented ability to share information, create communities and organize social movements. From a governmental perspective, this could be quite a challenge as social media may be used as a platform to directly challenge the government. It is also a \"Wild West\" in which misinformation could spread and hatred incited quickly with little means for regulation. Currently, while there are measures to mitigate the challenges posed by social media, they are still in their infancy and likely, very limited in their effectiveness. At the same time, the benefits of social media hardly offset the challenges, and hence it is reasonable to argue that social media poses more of a challenge to governments than not.\nThe widespread reach and unregulated nature of social media is perhaps the biggest reason governments find it a challenge. According to the International Communication Union, there are more than 3 billion Internet users worldwide. Most will have access to social media of some sort—such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and LinkedIn. This means that large segments of the population could be influenced by the use of social media for communication, either directly or indirectly. These platforms are difficult to regulate as there are very few existing laws governing social media, and it is difficult to enforce rulings when the platform'sowners are based in a different country. The sheer volume of information on those platforms also makes it impossible for regulators to keep close watch on everything. The most famous use of social media to challenge governmental authority is perhaps the Arab Spring of 2011, where social media was used to rapidly spread awareness of and coordinate the protests. The uprising led to the overthrow of Ben Ali, Mubarak and Gaddafi in Tunisia, Egypt and Libya respectively, and civil war in most others. Notwithstanding the fact that those governments were oppressive and an uprising may perhaps be justified, the fact remains that the use of social media could turn the people against their leaders with unprecedented intensity and speed. Similarly, in China, Facebook was used during the July 2009 Urumqi Riots by the minority Muslims in Xinjiang which led to the deaths of almost 200 people and almost 2,000 injured, in turn leading to the ban of the social media platform nation-wide. However, even on alternate, highly-censored platforms, many users have found sophisticated ways of going around censorship and regulation—the use of Virtual Private Network (VPN) technology allows users to access apps and websites which are officially banned, and the creative use of words and phrases have been able to circumvent regulation. For instance, netizens in China use \"May 35th1989\" to refer to the date Tiananmen Incident—\"July 4th2019\"—which itself is a banned phrase as the incident remains taboo. For governments who want to preserve stability and control over its citizens, social media poses a serious challenge as a means in which uprisings could be quickly and widely coordinated and gain a high public profile.\nEven when social media use does not lead to mass revolt, it could still pose a challenge as an arena in which dangerous ideas circulate. Terrorist groups such as ISIS regularly upload threatening videos and propaganda messages on social media, leading to \"self-radicalisation\" among citizens abroad. Foreign governments may also use social media to interfere in the affairs of another nation—a gross violation of the norms of international conduct, where it is generally agreed that countries would not intervene in each other'sdomestic affairs. In August 2019, the New York Timesreported that China was using LinkedIn to recruit spies in the US, by posing as businessmen or academics inviting American targets to travel to China for an academic conference or presentation, or a business opportunity. From there, the Chinese agents start building a rapport with their targets and slowly convince them to hand over state secrets. The US is also a victim of Russia'suse of Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Presidential Election that saw the election of Donald Trump—at the time perceived by Russia as their preferred candidate. Exacerbating these problems is the proliferation of \"fake news\", which many experts suspect not only influenced the outcome of the 2016 US Presidential Election, but the 2016 Brexit vote in the UK as well. In Singapore, the government passed a new piece of legislation in 2019—the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act—proving that social media poses a serious enough challenge to governments hoping to protect their citizens from malicious content. Additionally, profit-oriented social media companies have a stronger interest in earning profits than adopting responsible behaviour. For instance, users are particularly vulnerable to confirmation bias as online algorithms detect users\" personal opinions based on their online behaviour, and upload relevant posts on their news feed accordingly. Since most people currently receive their daily news from social media platforms, this means that society may become more polarised. Therefore, the unregulated but highly populated \"Wild West\" of social media poses a huge, and likely difficult to solve, challenge for governments as dangerous information circulate widely and quickly among their citizens.\nThe challenges posed by social media to governments may be negligible if they provide them with substantial benefits; however, that is unlikely to be the case. Politicians may find social media useful in helping them directly communicate with their voters. This makes leaders closer to the ground and more relatable. An extreme case happened in Turkey in 2016, when President Recep Tayyip Erdogan managed to survive a military coup by appealing to his supporters via a live stream on FaceTime. More typically, politicians use social media to upload photos of milestone events, inform followers of upcoming events, and have a direct line of communication with the public. However, their actions are also heavily scrutinised—any misstep on social media, no matter how slight, could cost them politically. Social media now acts as a check and balance against the government—something like a \"Fifth Estate\" or watchdog exposing governmental wrongdoings. For instance, in 2011, American congressman Anthony Weiner was forced to resign after a sexually suggestive photo he sent to a woman via Twitter was leaked to the public. With the ease in which misinformation can be spread through fabricated or outdated photos, or situations taken out of context, even the most honest and upright government would likely hold some reservations over the positive aspects of social media. Ultimately, most governments would conclude that social media ultimately poses a net challenge, and is largely a necessary evil that has to be managed.\nIn summary, social media is largely a challenge to government as a widely used by highly unregulated platform in which forces of disruption could spread like wildfire. Citizens may be driven to rise up against their leaders, or have their views distorted by outside propaganda. Such problems are threats to national security, and despite the benefits social media brings to governments in connecting with the people, it is safe to conclude that most governments rightly perceive social media as largely a threat that produces only some positive side effects."

Such conditions often mean that the elderly are marginalised in society—they are passed over in favour of younger workers, receive limited healthcare, and have their needs neglected during infrastructure development. This is especially a problem for countries such as Singapore which face an ageing population—low birth rates, high life expectancy. Not only is the talent pool for the workforce shrinking, working taxpayers have to support a larger number of elderly citizens. Overall, it is common for the elderly to be deemed to be weaker, more vulnerable and a burden to societies, leading to intergenerational tensions and a less happy lifestyle for the old. Recognising this challenge, Singapore has since taken steps to accept and appreciate the value of the aged via myriad ways, from enhancing their employability skills to investing in the healthcare and even integrating them into society by altering the living environment to elderly-friendly ones, to much success.\nA robust workforce is needed for any economy to thrive. It is thus tempting for employers to favour younger workers over older ones—elderly workers, despite their experience, may be less in tune with the latest skills needed, may take sick days more frequently and have less time to commit to a company before retirement. Yet, with an ageing population and shrinking work force, Singapore has started embracing the old. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices (TAFEP) now curtails workplace discrimination which is shown to be highly efficient as proven by the distinct drop in the number of job advertisements considered to be discriminators, from over 30% in 1999 to less than 1% in 2006. More recently, during the 2019 National Day Rally, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong announced a rise in the retirement and re-employment age by 2030 from 62 and 67 to 65 and 70 respectively. This signals a change from the traditional mindset that citizens would work to their 50s or early 60s before entering a happy retirement, to one where they remain integrated to the workplace longer to ensure sufficient income to meet rising life expectancy and support the Singapore economy. To assist older workers in staying relevant, skills-training programmes such as the Special Employment Credit (SEC) and Workfare Training Support (WTS) schemes encourage employees to hire and invest in training older workers. The Continuing Education and Training (CET) Masterplan, introduced in 2008, aims for nearly 50% of Singapore\" resident workforce to have at least a diploma qualification by 2020, compared to 36% in 2007. Similarly, the National Silver Academy was established in 2018, collaborating with universities and polytechnics to provide a host of courses that vary from media to design and even the humanities, thus addressing the concerns voiced by the elderly that they wish to keep their minds active and also hone new work and life skills for practical applications. All these initiatives point to the fact that Singapore has successfully taken the welfare and interests of the elderly into consideration and protected their position in the workforce.\nApart from improving their chances of employability, the Singapore government has also increasingly implemented policies and programmes which help the elderly cope with their medical and living needs. By investing huge sums of money in upgrading medical amenities and subsidising consultations and treatments, it is apparent that Singapore is more than willing to welcome the aged and tend to their basic needs, ensuring that they are not left behind. Efforts to develop and modify current healthcare system to cater to the demands of the ageing population have been mainly fruitful, with more elderly patients being able to gain access quality, affordable healthcare, without having to worry about their health and finances as much as in the past. The Central Provident Fund, a central savings scheme channelling part of citizens income into an account for basic healthcare needs, Medishield (low-cost basic medical insurance to help defray large hospitalization bills), Eldershield (affordable severe disability insurance scheme which provides basic financial protection to those who need long term care) and Pioneer Generation Package (to help senior citizens who are 65 and above in 2014 with healthcare costs) all seek to assist the elderly cope with rising health expenses in their old age. Access to such services are kept in mind as well—in the area of healthcare, new hospitals such as Khoo Teck Puat Hospital and Jurong General Hospital have been built in older HDB estates. In terms of living spaces, the Land Transport Authority (LTA) has installed, as part of the Silver Zone programme, new road safety features at selected locations in five residential areas with a higher proportion of elderly residents —Bedok, Bukit Merah, Jurong West, Marine Parade and Bishan—such as special road signs and markings to demarcate the Silver Zones and traffic calming measures to slow down motorized traffic and enable motorists to keep a better look-out for pedestrians. Positive response for this scheme has prompted the government to expand the project by aiming to revitalize another 15 more estates to become silver zones by 2017 and 35 silver zones by 2020. The government is not the only stakeholder in embracing the old, with Voluntary Welfare Organizations (VWOs) in Singapore also playing an integral role in the healthcare of the elderly as seen in the establishment of four community hospitals, two chronic sick hospital, 47 nursing homes and hospices, such as the Assisi Hospice, St Joseph'sHome and Agape Methodist Hospice, 17 day rehabilitation centres and home care services for the elderly. These measures have certainly been successful, as a recent report released by the Institute of Policy Studies indicated that 80% of respondents felt confident about their needs being taken care of and that in general most elderly Singaporeans have little to worry about. It thus seems safe to conclude that Singapore has done much to embrace the old, not only in the workplace, but also in terms of healthcare and living conditions.\nYet, despite numerous efforts to accord the aged with equal rights and ensure that they are well-blended into the society, there are instances where the elderly feel outcast and left behind as the rest continue to move forward. Even the government may slip up at times—in 2017, MediShield Life paid just $4.50 of a senior's$4,477 post-subsidy bail, undermining the very purpose of MediShield Life to keep healthcare affordable to the elderly. The Ministry of Health (MOH) took action not after repeated complaints, but only after The Straits Times published an article on the incident. Among Singapore citizens, many youths and middle-aged workers may, understandably, frown upon the idea of spending vast amounts of resources on the elderly at their expense. This attitude was showcased in the opposition against the construction of a nursing home in Bishan some years back—40 residents submitted a petition calling on the government to build the home elsewhere, citing that they were unwilling to give up the football field to make way for the nursing home and to live in close proximity to the aged who would disturb their and tranquillity with their constant groaning. Nonetheless, such cases are mostly isolated, and MOH has also revised its policies to ensure that hospitals cannot overcharge patients and that the elderly can make sufficient claims. Furthermore, the government has over nearly two decades attempted to bridge the gap between the youth and elderly. The Maintenance of Parents Act was passed in 1997 to protect the rights of the elderly and ensure that they are rightfully taken care of by their children financially, making Singapore the only state in the world to legally oblige grown-up children to care for their parents. In July 2002, the Family Matters! Singapore Taskforce on Grandparenting and Inter-generational Bonding was set up to promote activities that foster interaction and bonding between people of different generations and to learn from each other. Such moves are bound to improve understanding between the young and older people and chisel away stereotypes that the elderly are feeble, inactive or of little use to society. This will in turn result in a mindset change and the elderly would be valued by the society.\nIn conclusion, Singapore has made great leaps in embracing the old, which are increasingly forming a larger proportion of the population. From keeping them in the workforce to healthcare coverage to suitable living spaces, Singapore does seem to have welcomed the old with open arms as an asset to the country and as people who deserve to be well-taken care of, rather than marginalising them. Nonetheless, there are always gaps, especially in some members of the public'smindsets. On the whole, however, Singapore has indeed created a society largely embracing towards the old."

                "prompt": "IS CENSORSHIP JUSTIFIABLE?",
                "text": "\"It was a pleasure to burn.\" This is the opening line of Ray Bradbury'snovel \"Fahrenheit 451\", which gives us a glimpse of a world where one could not own or read books. People of this society are unable to think independently as they are unable to access alternative perspectives on controversial issues. Instead, the government controls what they can watch or hear through mainstream media platforms. While it may be a fictional world, several parallels between the society depicted in the book and our current world can be drawn, making the issue of censorship ever more pertinent in today'sera. Despite Bradbury'snovel mainly highlighting the negative impacts of censorship in media, it must be noted that censorship serves as a protective mechanism, a set of training wheels that is meant to be a temporary measure to protect the country until it is confident enough to deal with a truly free society. However, technological advancement and an increasingly well-educated populace underpin the rise of new media and citizen journalism, which do come with its perils. I therefore venture to argue that in our modern context, a completely censorship-free society is misguided.\nCensorship, which refers primarily to the alteration of certain narratives to fit a certain cause, or the omission of facts or opinions which contradict the dominant narrative, may affirm the viewpoints of individuals and groups, and this may have catastrophic effects. Besides affirming the viewpoints of individuals, the presence of \"Out of Bounds Markers\", which are a form of censorship meant to control the direction of public discourse, set a precedent where controversial issues are rarely or never discussed, allowing misconceptions or erroneous pre-conceived notions about a particular issue to proliferate. A prime example would be how censorship in China has led to a lack of understanding of its history and a hive mind. The Great Firewall of China, which prevents its citizens from accessing the rest of the Internet, along with prevalent internet censorship and distortion of facts has led to a lack of understanding of historical events such as the Tiananmen Massacre. Further, the way in which Chinese state media distort the motivations of protestors in the recent Hong Kong anti-extradition bill protests prevent mainlanders from truly understanding the motivations of the Hong Kong people, furthering the divide between the two populations. Such forms of media manipulation is also rife in other totalitarian states like North Korea. The state news agency, the Korean Central News Agency, provides the only source of information for all media outlets in North Korea. The media effectively paints the country in a positive light and have consistently upheld the personality cult of the ruling Kim family since the country'sindependence.\nPropaganda that has been promoted in such ways only prevent the locals from uncovering the truth, and as such, they are oblivious to the fact that they could be victims of human rights abuses. Another local example would be the \"brownface\" controversy in Singapore. This controversy began when an advertisement sanctioned by Mediacorp – in which a Chinese actor portrayed an Indian uncle by painting his skin with dark paint – drew the ire of citizens, including a pair of siblings who responded with a video presumably criticising the Chinese population for its majoritarian, racist tendencies. The Ministry of Home Affairs responded by urging the siblings to take down the video, which it alleged had seditious tendencies, and by warning other social media users not to circulate the video. The blatant censorship of the video, which was simply a response to the state-sanctioned advertisement, sparked a rancorous debate amongst members of the public. Many were unable to view the siblings\" video, and were thus unable to form a balanced view of the situation, which further inflamed tensions between those who felt the original advertisement which used \"brownface\" was offensive, and those who did not. As a result of the censorship, Singaporeans were unable to logically discuss and arrive at a common definition of \"racism\", as well as carefully consider the role of satire in public discourse. This illustrates the importance of transparency in the presentation of mass media, so that it may gradually provide people with opportunities to accept and embrace differences in society. The control of information and ideas would only stifle progress and perpetuate ignorance and hence, censorship may not be relevant or necessary in today'smodern context.\nIt can be argued that as literacy levels increase worldwide, the global population is more educated and more capable of being critical and discerning of the information it receives, and as such, the need for censorship has diminished considerably. Access to education has greatly been enhanced in many countries around the world. In fact, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) reports that more than 50% of the population in developed countries around the world have some form of tertiary education. In schools around the world, the curriculum has also been enhanced with media library programmes which emphasize the importance of reason and rationality. As such, it should be expected that a literate population is able to apply critical thinking to information and narratives provided by the media, and form their own opinions. More importantly, they ought to have the prerogative to decide for themselves what they would or would not like to see in media. That said, however, it appears that even with higher levels of education, citizens are unable to discern between falsehoods and facts presented to them: a study published in \"Science\", which analysed more than 126,000 tweets on Twitter, found that a falsehood reaches a group of 1,500 individual users at a rate that is 6 times quicker than a true story does. While increasing literacy rates may suggest a population that is more inclined to think critically, reality suggests otherwise. A more well-educated populace may not necessarily obviate the need for any form of control over the dissemination of information to the public, meaning that the concept of censorship may not be any less valid than it was previously.\nHowever, we must concede that there are certain instances where it is imperative that censorship be present to serve as a moral guide or compass of sorts. Its relevance and function is demonstrated in its ability to protect children from the ills of mass media. Children who are exposed to mass media for long hours become unknowing victims when they are unwittingly exposed to violent or sexual scenes. As such, children, who tend to be impressionable and naïve, are especially vulnerable to the ills of mass media. Due to the egregious impacts of such undesirable material, the need for censorship is legitimate and relevant. While it may be true that information on the Internet is difficult to control, the fact that a task is a Herculean one does not negate the responsibility of ensuring that it is done, especially when it is a necessary one. Age restrictions on movies, such as PG, M-18, NC-16, R-21, prevent young audiences from being exposed to material that is sexually suggestive or where excessive gore could result in unwise decisions. From this, it can be inferred that the need for censorship is justifiable because of the prevalence of questionable or immoral material that could erode the moral fabric of societies.\nIn addition, censoring sensitive issues such as racial or religious issues could prevent ethnic and religious strife. By eliminating such sources of instability, the government surely has the interest of the larger community in mind as social cohesion is of great importance to any country. For example, in Denmark, cartoons that were thought to have blasphemed the Muslin prophet Muhammed outraged the Muslim community worldwide, leading to the situation being blown out of proportion. In Singapore, a number of individuals have been prosecuted under the Sedition Act for posting insensitive racist remarks online. In 2015, the Sedition Act was invoked against Ello Ed Mundsel Bello, a Filipino nurse who disparaged Singaporeans as \"Stinkaporeans\" and \"losers\", and allegedly said that he would \"celebrate\" when \"more Singaporeans die\". Another classic case would be that of Amy Cheong'sracist rant case in 2012, where she disparaged Malays for what she perceived to be their low-cost and lengthy void-deck weddings, and also mocked their divorce rate. In these cases, censorship protects individuals and groups from vitriolic speech designed to intimidate and degrade on the basis of race, religion or language and exacerbate existing fault lines. Considering the benefits of censorship which are legion, the practice of censorship especially in a diverse, multiracial country like Singapore, is without a doubt vital.\nFurthermore, many individuals and corporations remain insensitive and even abusive of its use of mass and social media and have yet to reach a level of responsibility. This only undermines the reliability of mass media and calls for censorship laws to govern and regulate the media, so that it reports what is accurate and objective. With the rise in profit-making corporates running our media such as \"The Sun\" and \"The Daily Star\", sensationalism increasingly pervades our print media. The incessant exaggeration of reports not only clouds the judgement of the readers but also trivializes many important news. it should be acknowledged that mainstream media does also tend towards sensationalism and \"excessive coverage\" in order to sustain their viewership. For instance, following the release of a report on carcinogenic processed meat by the World Health Organization, mainstream media coverage of the report and its contents were overblown and often distorted the findings of the report. Even the Straits Times is guilty of sensationalizing reports of crime. This is presumably because mainstream media sources, especially those which use online mediums, tend to sensationalize important news to get \"clicks and likes\", which in turn drives up their advertisement revenue. The lack of journalistic integrity points to the need for some type of control over the information which is presented to the public, to prevent the false propagation of information, especially for news media as people ought to feel reassured that they need accurate news.\nOn a final note, despite the slew of problems that censorship brings about and its diminishing necessity in society, the exercise of censorship is essential and well-founded. However, with the increasing dominance of new media, it has become increasingly difficult to monitor everything. Hopefully with education and the cooperation of the public to utilize the internet responsibly, we can ensure that we do not end up like the dystopian society presented in \"Fahrenheit 451\" where the free flow of information wreaks havoc."

                "prompt": "\"THE DANGER OF MODERN SCIENCE IS THAT INSTEAD OF TEACHING MANKIND HUMILITY, IT HAS MADE US SUPREMELY ARROGANT.\" COMMENT.",
                "text": "In his bestselling book \"Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow\", Professor Yuval Noah Harari commented that \"during the Agricultural Revolution, humankind silenced animals and plants, and turned the animist grand opera into a dialogue between man and gods. During the Scientific Revolution, humankind silenced the gods too.\" In fact, the very premise of Harari'sseemingly outlandish claims is that modern science has made men gods; although the best and the brightest understand that scientific research simply reflects the inadequacy of human knowledge, the accessibility and transformative power of modern science has granted us an immeasurable amount of power which we are wont to abuse. This power manifests itself in terms of the ability to control fellow human beings, manipulate the biological building blocks of life, and decide the fate of all other forms of life on this planet, all of which we are already doing with impunity.\nIt should be established that the objective of scientific research is to produce accurate explanations of how the natural world works, and this is a slow and laborious empirical process. Proponents of the scientific method argue that the modern sciences have taught us just how little we know about the universe. As Valentine, a character of Tom Stoppard's\"Arcadia\" noted whimsically: \"It makes me so happy. To be at the beginning again, knowing almost nothing…The ordinary-sized stuff which is our lives, the things people write poetry about—clouds—daffodils—waterfalls—what happens in a cup of coffee when the cream goes in—these things are full of mystery, as mysterious to us as the heavens were to the Greeks…It'sthe best possible time to be alive, when everything you thought you knew is wrong\". Scientific discovery is premised on the fact that nothing can ever be found or proven to be right; it can only be proven wrong. Besides the mysterious possibility that the truth which we so wholeheartedly believe in at present may not be the objective truth, what science has uncovered about the natural world, about the universe is mind-boggling. For instance, NASA'ssuccessful exploration to the moon over 40 years ago brought about pieces of information about the solar system, the cis-lunar space, near-Earth asteroids, Mars and beyond. But each of those discoveries had to take place incrementally, with many safeguards in place, because there is so much more that space researchers do not know about.As Carl Sagan, an American astronomer and physicist, once asked, \"If we long to believe that the stars rise and set for us, that we are the reason for the Universe, does science do us a disservice in deflating our conceits?\", science humbles us by confronting us with the sheer perplexity of the unknown, and the vastness of the universe. The pale blue dot is simply a \"mote of dust suspended on a sunbeam\", and our petty struggles so insignificant when compared to the history of the universe. Knowledge of this fact should keep us humble, instead of make us arrogant.\nYet, if this fundamental premise of the scientific method is ignored, it can be argued that the power accorded to man by technological advancements has made us arrogant. It has allowed us to rule over our fellow human beings, and we have done so with little moral accountability. For many years, especially when destructive scientific knowledge fell into the wrong hands, mankind has sought the power of science to intimidate others into submission. From Hitler and his Nazi human experiments, to contemporary human experiments on the effects of chemical and biological weapons conducted in North Korea, there is no end to man'sdesire to control and manipulate our fellow beings. Even the United States employed modern scientific techniques to interrogate inmates at Guantanamo Bay through the use of high doses of barium to induce neuropsychiatric effects on the inmates, which led to suicidal thoughts and psychosis. Throughout the course of human civilisation, modern science has granted mankind the ability to take control of others by force, and the fact that we have done so with scant regard for our humanity attests to our arrogance.\nWhen it comes to the field of genetic engineering which seeks to modify the genetic makeup of an organism, it appears that science has allowed man to play God, and play God we have. In February 2016, the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority authorised the editing of genomes in human embryos using CRISPR technology for \"research purposes\". In 2019, barely 3 years later, Professor He Jiankui announced that he had altered the DNA of a pair of twins to prevent them from contracting HIV.This could transform the concepts of designer babies and eugenics into a frightening reality. Aldous Haxley's\"Brave New World\" describes a dystopian world where infants are grown in vats and sorted according to their intelligence levels. Even back in 1937, when the novel was first published, the fear of dehumanization and infringing upon the sanctity of human life was already gaining traction among readers.  Does having power alone make us \"arrogant\"? Not necessarily as it can be argued that it is the inability to set limits on our growing powers that constitutes arrogance. Although there is considerable academic debate about the ethical considerations of genetic engineering and authorities are moving to regulate this growing field, it appears that we have arrived at a stage where the ethical debates arising from CRISPR are severally left behind by technological advancement. According to a 2009 report released by the United Nations, 133 out of 192 nations lacked an adequate regulatory framework for the regulation of genetic modification technologies. In the wise words of Jean Rostand, a French biologist and philosopher: \"Science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being man.\" We now hold the biological building blocks of human life in our hands, which can be parlayed according to one'swhim and fancy – potentially undermining the sanctity of human life – and we have made insufficient efforts to understand and control the extent of our influence.\nGiven that modern science has allowed us to play God, it appears that our arrogance extends to asserting superiority over the other species which populate the Earth. Much has been said about how mankind uses animals for scientific experimentation, but modern science has even given mankind an opportunity to clone animals for the purpose of scientific advancement, food, environmental reasons, and even for man'ssentimentality. Pet cloning, which reunites owners with carbon copies of their beloved but deceased pets, is now a burgeoning international industry, which has grown by leaps and bounds since the first dog was cloned at the Seoul National University in 2005. Scientists and pet owners alike pay scant regard to the fact that 90% of fertilised embryos implanted in surrogate mothers either fail to implant, or spontaneously abort, or result in \"serious or fatal issues perinatally\", with disastrous effects on the health of the surrogate mothers. This is a prime example of the moral conceit and flagrant disregard for non-human life that sets in following the advent of technological advancement. Scientists have successfully genetically modified Aqua Atlantic Salmon such that it can grow much faster in order to meet the rising demand. The invention of fish that glow as a result of an insertion of a genetic element that causes the fish to fluoresce, is used to detect pollutants in water. Mankind has reached a stage where we can flagrantly transform entire animal species just for our selfish purposes without qualms as to whether these interventions impact the entire ecosystem in pernicious ways. Therefore, modern science poses the serious threat of mankind constructing an artificial environment, against the workings of nature.\nIn summary, though modern science has taught mankind to accept our limited knowledge about some secrets of the universe, it has enabled us to take pride in the ability to carry out research and experimentation that cross the ethical boundaries and jeopardise human safety. Hence, modern science poses the threat of making mankind supremely arrogant more than teaching us humility, and  the path to disaster may not be too far away if we do not rein in our scientific hubris."

                "prompt": "DISCUSS THE VIEW THAT THE ENVIRONMENT CAN ONLY BE SAVED THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF DEVELOPED NATIONS.",
                "text": "Heart-wrenching photographs of polar bears barely clinging on to a small remnant of ice to stay afloat, parched land highlighting the deleterious effect of desertification, and gaping holes in the Antarctic ozone layer have left the world astounded by the impact of their consumerism. The desire for infinite economic growth has irreversibly devastated the natural world, and efforts to rectify the situation have at best been weak and feeble. This could partly be because the question of who should be conserving the environment continues to go unanswered. Many assert that developed countries should assume a greater role in promoting environmental conservation because they have the financial means and technological expertise, and bear greater historical responsibility in causing this problem. However, relying solely on the efforts of developed nations may mean allowing developing nations and other important stakeholders to shirk responsibility even as they contribute to a multifaceted global issue. In light of the growing environmental consciousness across the world, it can be argued that concerted efforts by all the different stakeholders are necessary to mitigate this multidimensional issue that would affect all of us, and not just certain nations.\nThe prevalent view in our society is that developed countries are more well-equipped to protect our environment as they have achieved a certain level of wealth and prosperity and are in a better financial position to ensure the conservation of our environment. Their efforts in managing and mitigating the environmental crisis can be observed in a myriad of ways, from the building of eco-friendly buildings to the development of environmental technology. Developed countries have spearheaded projects utilizing low-carbon forms of energy for power generation. Canada leads the world in hydroelectric energy, which currently makes up 90% of its power supply. Countries with flourishing economies are also able to invest in the conceptualization and construction of eco-friendly buildings in an attempt to promote environmental sustainability. A successful execution of this idea can be seen in the United States. The Chicago City Hall Roof boasts a size of 20,000 square feet, featuring bottlebush grasses, wild rye and thousands of other plantings. It was created as a pilot program to reduce the building'scooling and heating costs and serves as a model for other Chicago buildings and it has succeeded in both aims. The insulating layer of soil and plants cool the building in the summer and helps hold heat in the winter, reducing climate control costs by $6,000 a year. This idea has already taken root on more than 300 other Chicago rooftops. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that due to the geographical and special constraints, it is not feasible for all countries to actually build hydroelectric plants, making the solution exclusive to countries with adequate land capacity and funds, which is not sufficient enough to make a significant effect on the environment, reiterating the fact that we cannot depend entirely on developed countries to resolve the issue of environmental degradation.\nAdditionally, most of the businesses and transnational corporations are headquartered in developed countries and they are greatly responsible for environmental degradation. If these companies take ownership of their actions and do their part to mitigate the environmental impact of their operations, the effect would be greatly apparent. A company that has gained the support of many for its efforts to be ecologically conscious is the soft drink company, Coca-Cola. Coca-Cola has developed a relationship with Earthshore'sFounding Member Charity, World Wildlife Fund to help it address pressing water issues, including water conservation. As a result of this collaboration, WWF and Coca-Cola teams have been able to leave positive effects on nearby bodies of water and reduce the amount of water used in the beverage company'sprocesses. One project improved fishing practices to preserve a 1.7 million acre wetland in Vietnam while another increased water efficiently in the company'sDowney plant where 50% of the water used to be wasted. With the intervention of Coca-Cola, that number is down to 17%. With this, it is evident that some multinational corporations in developed countries can initiate campaigns and programmes to make the world a better, greener place. However, while it should be noted that profits and efforts to save the environment are not mutually exclusive, given the growing emphasis on corporate social responsibility, not all companies are genuinely committed to mitigating environmental degradation. Many corporations pay lip service to environmentalism, believing that it is simply another marketing strategy to appeal to environmentally conscious consumers.  The term \"greenwashing\" – a creative spin on the word \"whitewashing\", was thus coined by the New York environmentalist Jay Westervelt. For instance, hotels worldwide place placards in each guestroom, ostensibly encouraging guests to reuse hotel towels and contribute to \"saving the environment\". In reality however, these institutions make little to no effort to reduce their environmental impact. In fact, the actual objective of this \"green campaign\" on the part of many hoteliers was in fact to reduce costs and increase profit. Over the years, environmental activists have labelled many businesses, including multinational oil corporations, such as Shell, BP, ExxonMobil, for their \"green washing\" efforts. Clearly, unless corporations endeavour to assure greater responsibilities and play a more instrumental role in solving environmental challenges, the efforts of governments of developed countries will be insufficient.\nWhile it has been established that governments and companies headquartered in developed countries have a major role to play in environmental conservation, the efforts by other stakeholders in developing countries should not be ignored. Developing countries have a part to play in protecting the environment as they are currently industrializing and are the main contributors to pollution and environmental degradation in today'sworld. That said, there have been instances where several developing nations have taken the initiative to mitigate environmental degradation via a myriad of ways. These include political involvement, policymaking, and conducting campaigns to raise public awareness, as well as ecotourism. Morocco, a developing country in North Africa, has demonstrated the political will to mitigate climate change by committing to ambitious targets, like having 42% of installed electricity production capacity come from renewable energy sources by 2020, and 52% by 2030. It has demonstrated that it is on track to meet its 2020 target and is poised to meet its 2030 target. As a result, it has been accorded the \"1.5 Degrees Celsius Paris Agreement-compatible\" rating by Climate Action Tracker, an independent scientific analysis produced by three climate organisations tracking climate change since 2009. There are also times when governments and organisations attempt to balance economic growth with environmental protection in the form of ecotourism. A country that is currently reaping the benefits of this form of sustainable development would be Belize, a country in Central America. In addition to the 36% of land mass that is protected in Belize, 13% of its water, including vast portions of the world'ssecond largest coral reef system, are protected as well. Efforts in the public sector also supplement the existing community-based projects that aid in boosting sustainable tourism in Belize. Within the Belize Barrier Reef, for example, the gorgeous atoll of Glover'sReef has been maintained as a \"no-take\" marine reserve, a sanctuary where fishing is prohibited. In a place threatened by illegal fishing and overfishing, this unique stretch of reef helps promote natural biodiversity. This therefore highlights that developing countries can still ensure economic growth without sacrificing the environment. Environmental damage can be mitigated with sufficient political will and public awareness, coupled with companies that are willing to play a part in environmental conservation and hence the efforts made by developing countries should be valued and taken into account when considering the stakeholders.\nWe have seen the various stakeholders act separately to conserve the environment. However, the ideal approach in tackling ecological damage should be through international collaboration, especially between governments from various countries, irrespective of developmental status. As their citizens become increasingly vocal about environmental problems, governments have to improvise, adapt and overcome existing and up and coming challenges. It is heartening to note that there have been increased international collaboration, as evidenced by the proliferation of political platforms and solutions such as the climate conferences, environmental summits, declarations and protocols. These have been established to facilitate discussions to deliberate and harness long-term objectives and to implement effective programmes to protect the environment. While many are sceptical of these meetings as many climate conferences like the Copenhagen Climate Conference and the Cancun Climate Conference have ended on a sour note, recently, the different countries have decided to put aside their differences and attempt to take ownership and responsibility of their actions, with the developed countries understanding the needs of developing countries and helping them. This harmonious collaboration was well-demonstrated during the \"COP21\" – United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Paris in 2015, when delegates from 196 countries agreed to the Paris Agreement. The agreement, which is the world'sfirst comprehensive agreement on climate change, was introduced with the objective of keeping the global average temperature increase to below 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, by reducing global carbon dioxide emissions by 20%, increasing the market share of renewable energy sources to 20%, and increasing energy efficiency by 20%. It was especially significant that the US publicly recognized its role in creating the problem of environmental devastation and finally embraced its responsibility to settle it by pledging to cut emissions by 26% to 28% by 2025. China also followed suit by instilling a target of 20% non-fossil fuels in its overall energy composition by 2030, with additional targets to reduce carbon and energy intensity. Moreover, the Paris Climate Accord is a comprehensive international agreement where under the deal, countries must publish greenhouse gas reduction targets and revise them every 5 years. This agreement ultimately aims to attain a carbon-neutral world before 2100. This therefore reiterates the motion that international collaborations are also considered to be vital in mitigating the pernicious effects of climate change and environmental exploitation, in addition to the efforts made by developed countries.\nIn summary, while it must be conceded that developed countries have a greater expertise to handle environmental concerns, their efforts alone will definitely fall short in the long run as it must be understood that all of us live in an interconnected world where the flap of a butterfly'swings can engender a storm halfway around the world. Therefore, everyone has a part to play in preventing further environmental degradation from developing countries on a macro-level, to individuals and small NGOs, on a micro-scale, and their responsibilities and actions should not be simply dismissed as inconsequential and insignificant. Therefore, the claim that the fate of the environment lies entirely in the hands of the developed countries is too narrow."

                "prompt": "CAN EDUCATION SOLVE ALL PROBLEMS?",
                "text": "The myth that education is the magic bullet to solve the problems that plague the modern world is one that is rooted in Lyndon B. Johnson'sGreat Society, which pivoted away from economic redistribution policies towards viewing education as the panacea to income inequality. While education empowers individuals and provides them access to more opportunities, and that in this respect, it is indeed a key tool and the answer to some of the many challenges which we face today, it cannot stand alone or solve all problems. Given the complexity of the issues and its inherent flaws and limitations, education alone cannot solve all the issues within our world today.\nAt first glance, it appears that education can catalyse positive social change through enlightening and empowering individuals and by broadening their horizons. Through formal education, individuals gain a better understanding of the world around them and their place in the world. Besides enlightening individuals, an education can empower one to improve one'scommunity, or to surmount one'sunique challenges. For instance, with respect to gender inequality, studies have revealed that women in developing countries who have been educated are half as likely to undergo harmful cultural practices such as female genital mutilation, and four times more likely to protect their daughters from it. Educated women are put in a better position to realize that they have the right to speak up and defend themselves from any abuse or harm. Besides empowering individual victims of gender inequality, education also ensures that whole communities are enlightened, and are able to solve social issues together. International efforts to combat racism and intolerance in schools have been introduced by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). This project, titled \"Teaching Respect for All\" was designed to develop curriculum for use across the globe to promote tolerance and respect for all people. It is evident that education is one of the most effective ways to help individuals adopt new mindsets and perspectives, in order to efficiently solve problems.\nIn addition, education levels the playing field of the disadvantaged by providing them access to opportunities to improve their standard of living and overcome the problems their communities might face. It does so by equipping people with the necessary knowledge and skills which are needed to seek employment. This understanding underpins many humanitarian projects such as the Thailand Hilltribe Education Project (THEP), which provides scholarships to needy students from Thailand'srelatively impoverished hilltribes. One of their beneficiaries is a living testament to the effectiveness of education in lifting individuals out of poverty; a recipient of the THEP scholarship, Ms Kanokwan, who was born into a family of farmers, managed to attain her bachelor'sdegree in English, and is now a teacher and a contributor to their sponsorship programme. Besides uplifting individuals and their families, societies which benefit from formal education seem to enjoy higher standards of living. According to the Education Transforms booklet released by the EFA Global Monitoring Report, this is because an educated populace is also a more productive populace, and productivity gains fuel economic development, which collectively raises the standard of living for a society. Hence, it can be argued that with education, people are more likely to enjoy a better life and hence, education is indeed the key to solving problems like poverty.\nYet, notwithstanding the fact that education has been effective in solving problems like discrimination and poverty, education should not be seen as a panacea to all problems. This is because there are many obstacles and aggravating factors which might limit the effectiveness of education. Education can only begin to tackle a problem if education is possible in the first place, for instance. The poor and impoverished cannot afford tuition fees, much less other learning tools and resources. Besides tangible barriers, intangible barriers include attitudinal factors: for many living in rural areas, education is sometimes seen as unnecessary or secondary, and comes at a higher opportunity cost as children are unable to help out as manual labour or farm help. A survey conducted by the child labour showed that 75% of the parents in Bangaladesh are unwilling to send their children to school because school expenses are a heavy burden. If the masses are unable to access education due to poverty and destitution, children will continue to be deprived of education, rendering it ineffective in solving problems.\nIn addition, there are certain problems which education would be unable to resolve alone. Although environmentalist movements like the Youth for Climate movement have been gaining traction in recent years, the United Nations noted that in 2018, carbon dioxide emissions were on the rise for the first time in four years. A report released by the United Nations Environment Programme indicates that a tipping point has already been reached in the Artic and Greenland, where permafrost has started melting more than 70 years before it was expected to. Even as Canada announces a \"climate emergency\", its political leaders approved of a new pipeline deal for natural gas. This is because of the sheer complexity of problems like climate change and environmental degradation; most of the time, the education of consumers alone is inadequate and ineffective in halting environmental destruction that has been ongoing for decades. In such cases, strong political will and corporate-sector leadership will be more effective. Siemens, the world'slargest manufacturer, has devoted more than 100 million euros to reducing its carbon emissions by half by 2030. Morocco, for instance, has introduced – and is set to meet – ambitious goals, such as targeting to have 42% of installed electricity production capacity from renewable energy by 2020. These examples illustrate the fact that political will and leadership would be more effective in mitigating climate change, especially because domestic energy consumption forms a remarkably negligible percentage of carbon emissions. Some of the problems which we face require a multidimensional and a multi-pronged approach, in which education can only form one pillar.\nFinally, education has its own inherent limitations, which may render it ineffective and even counterproductive in solving social problems. On the surface, it may seem that education is a social leveller that empowers individuals and improves lives. This, however, does not seem to hold true in increasingly stratified developed countries, where the presence of generational wealth is a critical determinant of academic success. In Singapore, which claims to uphold meritocracy, children from more affluent family backgrounds grossly outperform those who come from humbler backgrounds, primarily because affluent parents pass on advantages such as better learning resources and additional help like enrichment classes to their offspring. A research study conducted in 2016 found that nearly 41% of students in schools which offer the prestigious Integrated Programme were from families with a monthly household income of at least $10,000. Conversely, only 7% had similar backgrounds in government schools which did not offer the programme.  Students in the Integrated Programme enjoy opportunities and resources which their peers in government schools do not have access to, such as leadership programmes and education and career guidance mentorship. Given that the education system ultimately feeds into the job market, particularly in Singapore, the differences in access to educational opportunities since young inevitably result in severely hampered social mobility.\nIn summary, education can act as a catalyst to solve problems like poverty and discrimination. However, education is not the panacea to all the problems of the modern world because of the fact that there are people who cannot afford education; because of the multi-dimensional and multi-faceted nature of today'schallenges; and the inherent limitations unique to education. Ultimately, education can make the hopeless image of our future more vibrant and colourful, but that image will still be left incomplete if other aspects of society do not reform and complement education."

                "prompt": "\"AS SCIENCE ADVANCES, THE HUMAN RACE REGRESSES.\" IS THIS A FAIR COMMENT?",
                "text": "\"All of the biggest technological inventions created by man say little about his intelligence, but speak volumes about his laziness.\" This quote, widely attributed to Mark Kennedy, does indeed speak volumes about the questions which we are confronted with today: has scientific discovery advanced, while the human race languishes, and even regresses? With increasingly brave forays into the fields of artificial intelligence, neuroscience, genetic engineering, as well as broader and long-ranging explorations of the universe, we are breaking frontiers barely dreamt about just a generation ago. However, every new discovery not only brings along with it questions of application, access and distribution, it also highlights the extent to which we are unprepared for dealing with the moral and ethical questions associated with these developments, and the extent to which humans have regressed in terms of skillset. The possible exploitation of various technologies to mankind'sdetriment may not necessarily mean science is a barrier to society'sprogress as the reality is that the advent of science and technology has in fact allowed us to better understand the world and its complex systems, solved social and economic issues and even improved the quality of life, which are all synonymous with prosperity for all. It would be erroneous and unjustifiable, therefore, to generalise and claim that as science advances, man regresses.\nCritics of science often argue that while technological advancements have provided us with endless possibilities and allowed us to meet our basic needs, the relatively newer and unregulated fields of science have indubitably opened avenues for it to be exploited. Without adequately evaluating the possible ramifications of mismanaging certain technologies, it would be unwise to introduce new discoveries to the public. Lamentably, in many of these scenarios, the drive to make ground-breaking discoveries takes precedence over ethics and morality. In the eyes of some, this necessarily means the decline of human society because man has failed to hold onto the quintessential qualities which make one human. There is no better testament to this than the controversial adoption of genetic engineering for cosmetic purposes. CRISPR technology, though still in its nascent stage, has the potential to excise undesirable genes and insert favourable ones into gametes and embryos, allowing couples to select traits they wish their child to have. This could make the concept of designer babies into a frightening reality. Aldous Huxley'sBrave New World describes a dystopian world where infants are grown in vats and sorted according to their intelligence levels. Even back in 1937, when the novel was first published, the fear of dehumanization and infringing upon the sanctity of human life was already gaining traction among readers. Apart from going against the natural cycle of life that dehumanizes humans and reduces them to mere objects, genetic engineering also gives rise to a host of other social problems such as new definitions of normalcy and discrimination towards those who only possess average qualities, due to the emergence of a superior group with advantageous traits. In a world which strives towards equality and peace, this represents a step backward for mankind.\nMoreover, the competitive and cut-throat nature of scientific research has unfortunately bred a scientific community that is devoid of integrity and any sort of honour. The high profile suicide of Dr Yoshiki Sasai, a disgruntled stem-cell biologist at the Riken Centre for Developmental Biology in Japan, after allegedly fabricating data for clinical trials published in international journals, is just the tip of the iceberg. Institutes place immense pressure on scientists to produce transformative research, at the expense of their well-being and integrity. Many scientists have fabricated research published in academic journals, with even peer-reviewed scientific journals to verify the results of such experiments. This may have far-reaching consequences in the future as fabrications not only cast doubt on the credibility of medical research but leave scientists vulnerable to making critical mistakes. Given that the scientific revolution underpins humanity'sprogress, this may be detrimental to mankind, and may even retard any significant improvement to society.\nApart from the possible exploitation of scientific technology, the development of communications technology has facilitated the free flow of information and goods over the Internet, particularly the Dark Web. Technology has democratised research processes, created cheaper production tools and made information freely available to those interested in seeking them. That, however, means that there would be instances where private data can be tapped on and harnessed for nefarious purposes. While we celebrate ground-breaking discoveries in the fields of surveillance and space technology, we should be cognizant that problems have also surfaced in its wake.  Pertinent issues such as privacy and security should not be swept under the rug as the scale and scope of such technology are substantially widened. A case in point would be the use of satellite data in the planning of terrorist activities. Prior to the launch of Google Earth, which employs satellite imagery, detractors had already warned of the dangers that digital maps could pose, such as aiding terrorist operations. In 2007, British bases in Basra were attacked by terrorist who had used aerial footage from Google Earth to identify target locations. Moreover, with the advent of the Internet of Things, consumers will inadvertently leave behind data trails, which could be fodder for opportunists with fraudulent intent. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal revealed that Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm, had been harvesting data from Facebook profiles without seeking the consent of users and used the data for political advertising. The understanding that big tech firms have been harvesting data from the ordinary man, and that information necessarily begets power and influence, underpinned the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union. The General Data Protection Regulation was introduced to ensure that citizens are aware of and are able to control the process by which their data is harvested and used by technology companies. Undeniably, the rise of scientific technologies has witnessed an increased flouting of both social norms and law, capitalizing on the hydra-like nature of the internet, with scant regard for the pernicious consequences, such as the loss of privacy and security. This is a clear sign of regression as it infringes on people'srights to protect their personal life, making them vulnerable in the process.\nYet, despite claims that science and its developments should be curtailed as they pose a risk to the human race, proponents of science would agree that restrictions and guidelines have been placed upon these advancements to ensure the safe use and development of scientific technologies. The fact that societies around the world have chosen regulation over blunt instruments like partial or complete bans implicitly suggest that humanity has benefitted from scientific developments. Science has always helped to expand the combined human pool of knowledge, allowing man to gain insights into the secrets of nature, and enabling him to manipulate this for the greater good of mankind. Science has been instrumental in debunking claims: for instance, the belief that interference with a dead body was an offence to the gods held us back from understanding the human anatomy until the 13thcentury. Andreas Vasalies was able to provide detailed drawings of the human anatomy in the 16thcentury, which ultimately proved invaluable to the development of the branch of medicine now known as surgery. The development of the microscope by Anton Van Leeuwenhonk debunked superstitions that diseases rampant in India, China and Europe were caused by \"miasma\", a passing vapor filled with particles from decomposed matter. These examples evinced the claim that scientific advancements have clarified decades of misconceptions which were hindering the progress of human civilisations.\nAt the same time, social and economic ills that had once blighted mankind'spursuit of progress have now been surmounted by technology. While people in developed economies tend to have access to shelter and education, the same cannot be said of their counterparts living in developing countries. The emergence of technology like genetically modified crops and information technology have revolutionized the way people can escape the straitjacket of poverty and improve their lives. The concept of Green Revolution has taken the world by storm as it was able to increase and enhance the quality of food, establishing food security in many impoverished societies. These series of research, development and technology transfer initiatives were regarded as a panacea to the Malthusian conundrum that the world was facing where the world population was projected to outgrow the food supply, possibly leading to mass starvation. The Green Revolution, which involved high yielding varieties (HYVs) and genetically modified crops, resulted in an exponential increase in global cereal production by 280% and in global consumption per capita by 25% between 1961 and 2004. Besides addressing hunger, the Green Revolution addressed other aspects of food security, such as nutritional inadequacy, with genetically modified crops. Golden Rice, touted to be a genetic marvel, was efficient in meeting the dietary requirements of those afflicted with Vitamin A deficiency. In societies where widespread famine has struck and there seemed to be no hope for improvement, the Green Revolution was an enormous breakthrough for poverty reduction efforts and indeed shines as a success story. Amidst mounting worldwide social and economic tensions, the history of scientific advancement only serves to reaffirm the idea that science is the panacea to a wide host of social problems.\nIn addition to fulfilling mankind'sbasic and physical needs, technologies have revitalized the medical arena and have improved the quality of life. In recent times, many tools and procedures have been invented with the objective of prolonging human life. Devices such as the artificial pacemaker have been invented to prolong the life of individuals suffering from once debilitating health conditions like Bradycardia. More recently, the National Heart Centre Singapore has proposed that scans of patients\" hearts could be turned into 3D models. This has long-standing benefits as it helps cardiac surgeons make better surgery plans, especially for non-invasive procedures, and can also be used as a training tool for young doctors. Most importantly, the arrival of such technology would make animal testing obsolete; finally, human health need not be predicated on the suffering of animals, which is a step forward for mankind.People may also pin their hopes on pharmacogenomic research and the concept of personalized medicine, which is administered with the understanding that individuals may have different responses to drugs due to different genes. Medco Health Solutions, one of America'slargest pharmacy benefit managers until it was acquired by Express Solutions in 2011, was leading the way in making the provision of personal genomics services to the masses a reality. It had already achieved successes with personalized treatment of Warfarin, a widely used blood thinner to prevent clots, and Tamoxifen for breast cancer. Essentially, matching the right drugs to the patients has obvious clinical benefits, but also makes good economic sense. By reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis, long hospitalization periods and the need for follow-up treatment, personalized healthcare can generate significant cost savings. All of these will ultimately allow patients to direct their own care to some extent, empowering them with a greater sense of freedom and self-reliance, truly heralding a breakthrough in medical science. Advances in personalised medicine would also allow for the treatment of rare disorders and allow the industry to track the development of diseases. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the National Healthcare System is collaborating with academia and industry to analyse the genetic material of persons with rare disorders through the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is hoped that such information will shed light on and save lives from disorders which were previously unknown. Contrary to popular belief that scientific discovery would cause humanity to regress, the history of medical science is a testament to the fact that scientific advancements can bolster the development of the human race.\nIn summary, science has apparently revolutionised the way we live today, by mechanisation, automation and by altering the way we think. While there are instances, though few and far between, where scientific technologies seem to threaten our very humanity, it must be recognized that those do not necessarily mean science only pulls society backwards. The numerous checks and balances in place today serve to assure us that we can trust science to influence us positively as it always has, as we continue to revel in its wonders."

                "prompt": "\"SOCIAL MEDIA DIVIDES MORE THAN IT UNITES\". TO WHAT EXTENT IS THIS TRUE?",
                "text": "It all started with Six Degrees. Launched in 1997, this website enabled users to upload a profile and make friends with other users. It was the predecessor of the many social networking sites to come, and its creation heralded the advent of a new era – an era in which social media would emerge as a new medium of communication. Defined as a group of Internet-based applications that allow the creation and exchange of user-generated content, social media takes on many different forms, from social networks to social news to even Wikis. Given how pervasive social media has become, it is indisputable that it can influence individuals, and hence wields the power to both divide and unite the community. While it has the potential to create rifts within society by perpetuating existing divides like the generational divide and creating echo chambers, it has an even greater potential to bring individuals together. It cuts across physical boundaries to unite, facilitates the sharing of different opinions, and sheds light on various otherwise unknown situation. Therefore, social media does not, in fact divide more than unite.\nAdmittedly, social media does perpetuate and exacerbate the generational gap between the older and the younger generations of today. The younger generation are known as \"digital natives\" who have grown up with technological gadgets as their toys and social media as a legitimate means of self-expression. In fact, according to a research conducted by Pew Research Centre on 700 American youth in 2018, close to 95% of teenagers have access to a smartphone, and 45% say that they are online on social media platforms on a \"almost constant\" basis. The older generation is remarkably less adept at using technology and social media: while 90% of those aged 18-29 use at least one social media account, only 40% of those aged above 65 do. With the older generations lacking an interest in and knowledge of social media, the two groups are unable to relate to each other, especially since one is so immersed in social media culture, such as memes, and the latter is not. This thereby creates an ever-widening chasm between the two of them.\nAdditionally, social media platforms have created filter bubbles, and their pervasive influence create echo chambers, where users are inundated with information that support their existing views and are underexposed to information that challenges their assumptions, thereby effectively isolating them in their own cultural or ideological bubbles. Though the use of algorithms, social media sites such as Google, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have taken to doing this, streamlining the information their users see first based on their online behaviour. According to research by the Pew Research Centre, 47% of conservatives are likely to see Facebook posts aligned with their own views, as opposed to half that percentage for those who seek the middle ground. This form of filtering is rather worrisome because it affirms its users\" confirmation bias, creating the impression that only one correct stance – theirs – exists.  It is not conducive for discourse since individuals are not exposed to other narratives which may challenge their own. Therefore, the evolution of such filter bubbles on social media may lead to the polarisation of various groups within the society, hence diving instead of uniting.\nHowever, social media'sability to unite should not be overlooked. There is no doubt that social media facilitates the interaction of people across borders. Social media allows people to make new friends from different nationalities, as well as sustain relationships with friends and family who have moved overseas. For example, through sites like Tumblr blogs, friendships can be forged between someone living in Asia and another living in Canada. These allow for a deeper understanding of other cultures, practices and ways of thinking that we may not otherwise be exposed to. With this greater comprehension comes more tolerance, and therefore greater unity on a global level. Additionally, social networking applications such as Skype and Facebook allow video calls to be made, which are helpful in maintaining that human touch. Social media has shrunk the world into one that can be accessed from the small screen of a smartphone, reducing the distance between people.\nNext, social media allows individuals from all walks of life to air their views, and facilitates discourse between individuals with distinct, unique perspectives. Since close to 1.7 billion people of the 7.2 billion people in the world today have active social media accounts, there is a smorgasbord of differing opinions online. Social media platforms empower these individuals to broadcast their views, and thus provides one with a unique insight into the views of others. Take for example, Singapore'spolitical scene. Cognizant of the increasing online presence of Singaporeans, the government created a website called eGov2015 in a bid to ensure that feedback from Singaporeans from all walks of life can be heard, and to facilitate greater co-creation and collaboration between the government and the people. Social media therefore makes it easier for individuals and organizations alike to hear different views and thus act accordingly.\nFinally, social media also helps to unite the global community by shedding light on situations all around the world. With the ease of dissemination of information, netizens all around the world are not just able to glean insights into the struggles of others but are empowered to take action. For example, the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge, started in the summer of 2014, raised $11.5 million for its cause. Over 17 million people uploaded their challenge videos to Facebook, and thus cause was also championed by celebrities such as Taylor Swift, Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg. The challenge was started in a bid to raise awareness for the disease known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and the use of social media spreading this challenge resulted in its resounding success. A more recent example would be the Trashtag Challenge, where social media users pick up litter, clean their environment and later post a photo of their accomplishments on social media. It has allowed users a better insight of the sheer scale of the plastics pollution problem. It is a good example of how social media can go further than raising awareness to mobilizing individuals to act, producing tangible results. In this way, social media allows for the creation of unity among people, for it raises awareness about issues that society is confronted with and mobilizes people to act in the interest of their communities.\nIn essence, while social media may cause rifts to occur and widen within society, its tendency to unite and bring people together is even greater. The availability of information online allows for the forging of a more understanding and hence, more united world and is something that would have been unattainable in a world fragmented into isolated groups."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS IT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A FAIR AND INCLUSIVE SOCIETY IN YOUR COUNTRY?",
                "text": "In a meritocratic, pluralistic nation such as Singapore, what does it mean for a society to be \"fair\" and \"inclusive\"? When there is fairness, the treatment of all individuals is not predicated on indicators which are out of his control, such as race or religion. When a society is inclusive, all members benefit from progress and equality of opportunity, diversity is celebrated instead of shunned, and all individuals are allowed to participate in deciding the creation and direction of social institutions. Singapore is already quite fair and inclusive with the coexistence of diverse racial and religious groups bearing testament to its strong social fabric. That said, however, rampant allegations of micro-aggressions and a society that promotes tolerance instead of genuine acceptance suggest that it is not entirely a completely fair and inclusive one. While it is possible to strive for greater fairness and inclusiveness in Singapore, having one that is entirely equal and accepting is impossible, although this should not stop us from continually striving for one.\nIt is possible to have a fair and inclusive society in Singapore as government policies can aid in the creation of such a society. The importance of procedural equality has been enshrined in Singapore'sConstitution, and has been enforced through non-discriminatory policies. For instance, all individuals are treated equally in the court, with no difference in treatment on the basis of race, religion or social status. Hence, this reinforces the understanding that one'srace, religion or indeed other demarcations of social status do not exempt him from the laws of the country, thereby affirming the concept of fairness. The government has also made known its goal for an inclusive society, one where everybody is accepted, and allowed to decide the direction of the country, regardless of race or religion. It has introduced policies such as the Group Representative Constituency, which mandates that political parties are to field at least one minority candidate in the elections. This policy, which ensures some form of minority representation in Parliament, serves to reinforce the fact that all groups are included in the Singapore national fabric, and their interests will be served. The success of these policies that the Singaporean government has already enforced shows that a culture of equality and inclusivity can indeed be cultivated through the actions of the government.\nIt is also possible to have a fair and inclusive society in Singapore due to the availability and the quality of our educational system, which functions as an adequate leveller of social mobility. Children from the age of seven to the age of twelve are expected to go to primary school, ensuring that they are literate and have an understanding of the four most basic subjects – English, their own Mother Tongue, Math and Science. School fees are highly subsidized by the government, with most public schools charging less than a hundred Singapore dollars a year. The affordability of education is critical in ensuring a fair and inclusive society, for it equips all children with the knowledge they need to get through life with, such as the ability to read, write and count, regardless of their family background, race or religion. Education also aids in levelling the playing field, for it gives the children an equal opportunity of academic success whether they are from a wealthy or not-so-wealthy families. This often is a direct translation of the amount of effort a child puts into his studies, and so, even a child from a disadvantaged background can get into university with government or corporate scholarships. This therefore aids in creating income mobility within the population, preventing the creation of a single educated group, and hence, social segregation and exclusivity.\nHowever, while education may be a means with which one can get out of the poverty cycle, it can also work in the opposite direction – by widening the income gap between the rich and the poor in Singapore. Richer families are easily able to afford tuition, which sets those children from those families up on a more advantageous position. The help rendered to them by their tutors make it easier for them to excel in their studies as compared to the children from poorer families that cannot afford tuition, hence widening the education disparity between the rich and the poor in Singapore. Increasingly, Singaporeans have lost faith in the education system as a leveller, as a representation of social mobility, with many criticising the fact that students in elite schools tend to hail from affluent family backgrounds, and the increased importance of social capital in Singapore.  Given the fact that the education system has traditionally fed into the labour market, there are concerns that the education system only serves to perpetuate the cycle of inequality.\nLastly, it is possible to have a fair and inclusive society in Singapore through the appeal to the individual. From the age of seven, Singaporean students are made to recite the Pledge in school on a daily basis, subconsciously reminding themselves that differences in race, language, and religion does not make one more, or indeed less, of a Singaporean than anyone else. Singaporeans are taught from when they were young that everyone is equal, and this is hopefully reflected in their dealings with others in the later part of their lives. The creation of a society that welcomes all, despite their differences, can only be done through cooperation of individuals.\nThat said, however, it is ultimately up to individuals to practise being inclusive and non-discriminatory. While Singapore claims to have achieved a \"harmonious and inclusive\" society, in reality, racial and religious tensions simmer beneath the surface; according to a YouGov survey, 23% of Singaporeans have experienced discrimination while renting properties. Minorities seem to be disproportionately affected, with 49% of Indians surveyed and 34% of Malays reporting such experiences. More than 80% of minorities also report the occurrence of \"microaggressions\" in their daily lives, suggesting that even a society like Singapore which tries its best to be inclusive has a long way to go. Notwithstanding this, as long as individuals actively strive to correct their biases, the culture of fairness and inclusivity will hopefully grow stronger.\nIn conclusion, it is indeed possible to have a highly fair and inclusive society in Singapore, through the implementation of government policies, education, and outreach on an individual level, especially since the framework and guiding policies that have been set down by the leaders of Singapore highlights the importance of those two qualities."

                "text": "Mankind has always had a knack for finding the easy way around the most difficult tasks. Once we developed the technology needed to survive the brutal forces of nature in the Stone Age, mankind embarked on a journey of technological advancement in pursuit of a better life. Ironically, in our quest to automate and optimize our processes, we have become heavily reliant on technology, rendering many skills that were once considered fundamental and essential useless. Therefore, I believe that technology, while greatly improving our quality of life, has had an adverse impact on the skill levels of mankind.\nThe negative impact that technology has had on our interpersonal skills is perhaps the most pervasive and insidious one yet. Technological advancements in communication – more particularly the development of the smartphone – has revolutionised the way we interact. Texts and direct messages have now substituted face-to-face interaction, and emojis and stickers are at present the most convenient conveyors of our mood. With the younger generation of today growing up in a world like this, many of them are more comfortable with socializing online than in real life. Undeniably, this new form of communication has many perks: speed, immediacy, and the ability to avoid direct confrontation are just a few. However, this has led to many of them losing their ability to communicate effectively with others. They shy away from situations that require them to mingle, choosing to use social media to get to know others instead. They are better able to sustain a conversation online than offline, to read text cues than a change in tone, to interpret the blue tick than body language. This dependence has resulted in a situation where many use their smartphones even in the presence of others, to the detriment of their communication skills. Naturalistic research indicates that people who had conversations without the presence of a mobile phone felt that these conversations felt higher levels of \"empathetic concern\", as opposed to those who conversed with the presence of a mobile phone. This suggests that the very act of using technology to cope with social realities and communication impedes us from fully developing our skills of empathy and interpersonal communication. The multi-faceted art of communication has been relegated to the mechanical act of typing and tapping – very sorry degeneration indeed.\nFurthermore, technological advancements have witnessed the degradation of the skills people require for their jobs. Most jobs today are heavily reliant on information technology as it provides easier ways around otherwise labour intensive, manual jobs. Machines have replaced manual labour at the frontlines of production, and computer applications have created easier ways of accessing and handling data. This has thus seen a colossal upheaval in the way people work – they are now dependent on computer applications and software to do the work that previously required a high level of skill to do. Programs such as Excel organize, tabulate, and analyse data for the user, making the accountant'sjob much easier. Artificial intelligence software, such as Watson, uses natural language processing to interpret chunks of unstructured data, allowing businessmen to derive meaning from the statistics that they have. In Singapore, Lex Quanta, a data analytics firm, has created an application to predict the division of assets in divorce cases, rendering the traditional skills which junior lawyers possess obsolete. Therefore, with the advancement of technology to the point that we are able to delegate half our workload to machines, the de-skilling of the workforce has occurred, negatively impacting the skills levels of many workers in various industries.\nAdditionally, our motor skills have also deteriorated greatly due to the advancements in technology. The widespread proliferation of smartphones and gaming consoles like Xboxes and Wiis has resulted in and more and more youngsters today preferring to stay indoors and indulging in those games instead of going outdoors and playing actual games. Additionally, video games have the added edge of being more easily accessible than engaging in sporting activities is, and hence, many youths spend much of their free time playing those games instead, growing better at them while leaving themselves completely unexposed to outdoor physical activity. Furthermore, the likelihood of a child getting exposed to video games than to sports at an earlier age is higher, for today'scautious parents are more willing to have their children nestled within the confines of one'shome, transfixed by the dancing graphics on a screen, rather than being out kicking a ball around. Therefore, the advancements in technology have made it easier for youths of today to dedicate more time to their gaming skills rather than to their sporting abilities, leaving these motor skills relatively untouched and undeveloped, if not actively degenerating.\nHowever, it must be noted that technology has had a positive impact on stimulating the minds of people at large, promoting critical thinking skills and creativity. With technological advancements, the average person in a developed country is now able to access an entire treasure trove of knowledge that has been collated online. He is now empowered to contribute solutions related to these areas of interest. Furthermore, the differing points of view and contrasting schools of thought that are readily available online allows one to broaden his or her perspectives, equipping one with the mental dexterity to think laterally, instead of just vertically. Technological advancements have also made an array of software applications and programs accessible to laymen, such as blogs, computer-aided design applications, and video and photo editing tools. These programs have allowed people to harness and display their creativity in a wide variety of ways – blogs have allowed people the liberty to write or make videos on any topic they like, computer-aided design programs have allowed people the ability to come up with design ideas for buildings and products, and video and photo editing software have allowed people to tap on their visual creativity to make their images more aesthetically pleasing. Therefore, with the smorgasbord of applications made available to all due to the technology of today, people are better able to think creatively and express themselves in such a way.\nIt can also be argued that technology has also improved our cognitive skills significantly. The advent of wiki pages, online learning platforms, as well as podcasts has equipped people today with the ability to learn about anything, anywhere, at any time. If one has a query about any topic, she can simply search it up online and find answers that would help her resolve their doubts. Learning is no longer confined to within the constraints of the classroom, and students today are urged to venture out of what is merely in the curriculum and do more independent research. Online sources are now acknowledged as legitimate references, underscoring their reliability and quality. Additionally, as there is so much information online, the act of thinking deeper is thus facilitated. People are more prone to deliberating on topics and asking more questions when they can find answers to their queries, and the Internet provides a ready bank of information to answer these queries.\nAll in all, it is no secret that technology has an impact on the skills of people today. While it is true that as mankind embraces the more efficient, more productive methods of doing things, it has facilitated the greater development of our creativity and intellect, the gains that we have made in that aspect have come at the cost of our soft skills. However, it is not too late to reverse this impact that technology has made on those skill sets of ours, but we have to first acknowledge the effects that it has had on us."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR CAN ONE INDIVIDUAL MAKE A POSITIVE CHANGE IN YOUR SOCIETY?",
                "text": "Margaret Mead, a renowned cultural anthropologist, once said, \"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it'sthe only thing that ever has.\" An individual may appear to be helpless, insignificant even, in the face of the majority paralysed by inertia, but individuals can still actively participate in and initiate positive change in society by influencing others across political, economic and social spheres. Increasingly, there are more avenues and opportunities for Singaporeans to make a positive change in society.\nIndividuals can make a positive change in our society through political discourse and discussion and by mobilizing others to participate in political discourse and discussion. While political discussion was muted, and largely top-down in the past, the advent of social media has increased the accessibility of and democratized the responsibility of political discourse. Through political discussions, individuals can take on the establishment and challenge the status quo by drawing attention to various issues and problems in the system. As a democratic society, it is imperative for the government to respond to its citizens\" concerns and needs, and the different forms of mass and social media are the platforms in which Singaporeans can feedback to the government and push for policy changes. Singaporeans have used social media platforms like Facebook during past elections to air their views on the various issues confronting Singapore. During the 2015 General Elections, more than 600,000 netizens posted as many as 5 million posts on Facebook about the elections, demonstrating the opportunity for Singaporeans to increasingly participate in this nationwide conversation. The amplification of the voices of the ordinary man through digital platforms means that the government increasingly has to move towards a more \"consultative, collaborative\" approach under the auspices of the Fourth Generation leadership. Another salient example of how individuals can directly enact change in society is the National Library Board (NLB) saga in 2014. When the NLB removed several children'stitles for promoting alternative family units like homosexual and single-parent families, a strong reaction came from the ground, where many saw the move as discriminatory and regressive. An individual started on online platform urging NLB to reinstate the books, quickly gathering thousands of signatories. The national library finally conceded by moving the books to the adult section, instead of removing them all together. We see clearly how the average Singaporean now has the power and ability to galvanise the authorities to make policy changes that reflect their beliefs and interests. In this \"Save my Library\" campaign, Singaporeans have made it clear that there is no place for discrimination against alternative families and the LGBT communities, and in doing so prodded Singapore to advance as a more tolerant and accepting society. Through political discourse, Singaporeans can have their concerns and beliefs heard. As this conversation shifts a monologue to a dialogue, individuals can now make a positive change in society through providing feedback and suggestions.\nIndividuals can also bring about positive change to society by raising awareness of and highlighting various social issues to advance these causes. Many causes and campaigns spring from one individual with a strong conviction, before becoming an amalgamation of like-minded individuals. The Pink Dot movement began as a small event started by a few activists in 2009 before growing into a huge movement with close to 30,000 participants just ten years later. What started off as a small-scale effort by individuals to promote the acceptance of the LGBT community has today become a nationwide conversation and discussion on where Singaporeans stand on homosexuality and how we should move on from here. The issue of homosexuality is no doubt a critical one as Singapore matures as a civilised society, and the Pink Dot movement, as a bottom-up initiative, has served to highlight this issue and bring what was previously a taboo topic into mainstream discussion. The Sim Lim Square incident in 2014, where a mobile retail store Mobile Air drew flak for scamming a Vietnamese foreign worker, also demonstrates how individuals can play a part to enact change. The controversy was started when the worker was filmed by a Singaporean crying and begging the retailers for a refund, and has since generated a wider discussion about the sordid state of regulations against unethical Sim Lim Square retailers. The incident has prompted consumer watchdog CASE to relook measures and step up efforts in eradicating malpractices by errant shop owners. Another individual started a crowd-funding campaign separately to raise money to help the foreign worker and was successful in gathering widespread support for the worker. This incident highlights how Singaporeans can and have been making positive changes in our society through simple acts and efforts that have snowballed to raise awareness and generate discussion and change.\nAdditionally, individuals can also make positive changes in society through social activism to help vulnerable communities and make Singapore a kinder and more compassionate society. The Ground Up Initiative, for instance, was started by Tay Lai Hock in 2002, and seeks to promote the \"kampung spirit\" of neighbourliness in tandem with sustainable living. It is admittedly breaking ground and entering the consciousness of educators and students in Singapore, even as the country seems to relentlessly hurtle away from its past, into the future. Through social activism, a single individual can engender positive change in society by impacting the lives of others through small but genuine efforts. Another example is that of The Hidden Good, a movement started by two youths several years back which has also drawn much attention for its attempts to enact change. Through its series of social experiments and online podcasts, the Hidden Good aims to highlight the inherent and latent kindness in each and every Singaporean and make Singapore a more compassionate society. Through these various efforts, many individuals have in their own ways started a spark to fuel. While individual efforts may seem insignificant in a seemingly idealistic cause, it is all these ground-up efforts that have successfully reached out to the disenfranchised and underprivileged who may have been left behind.\nHowever, skeptics may argue that it is highly improbable for an individual alone to make a significant impact in our society, given how risk-averse and conservative we are. They purport that individuals cannot make a significant positive impact on society as the status quo is simply stacked too highly against them and that the authorities hold too much sway over the civil sphere. Some may point to the \"Save My CPF\" campaign, for which blogger Roy Ngerng was sued for defamation for voicing his opposition an unhappiness about the national savings scheme, citing how the bureaucracy and political system are still resistant to change and alternative voices system are still disregarded. In a climate where the government remains conservative and powerful, and the system is entrenched in tradition, the individual seems powerless to be able to do much to change society. Yet, as Singapore moves into a more mature and developed society, this belief is increasingly outdated. While it is true that the government is still conservative and maintains strict control over many issues, there are now many more opportunities for an individual to bring about change, through discourse and activism. As Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has said in recent times, the government will move towards a more collaborative, co-creative leadership model under the fourth generation of leadership. Even if we have some way to go before we can become a truly open country that is receptive to change, the truth is that individuals today can already make a change in society in small but effective ways.\nAn individual alone has the power to bring about positive change in society by setting in motion a domino effect that will eventually have far-reaching impact. Through political and social activism, we see how many Singaporeans have come forward to do their part for society by triggering greater awareness and discussion or simply by touching the lives of those they help. As Singapore moves into the future, it is important for Singaporeans to be more participative and engaged in bringing about change in society. Even if an individual effort seems insignificant in the larger scheme of things, it is many of those tiny but important efforts that will move Singapore society into a more developed, civilised, mature and kind one."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR IS IT FAIR TO CONSIDER THE ELDERLY TO BE A BURDEN ON SOCIETY?",
                "text": "In the 1960s to 1980s, before its asset-price bubble burst leading to the Lost Decades, Japan was experiencing booming economic growth brought about by its rapidly expanding workforce. Like all developed economies, the excessive focus on career development led to a declining birth rate. Fast forward a few decades, and Japan is now grappling with a dwindling and aging population, struggling to cope with its economic ailments which are being compounded by its skewed demography. Similarly, many developed countries in Asia and Europe are facing this complex issue of an aging population amidst falling Gross Domestic Products (GDP) and slowing economic growth. Often, the repercussions of such situations are conflated with negative views of the elderly as burdens to society. While I acknowledge that the elderly may require greater public expenditure and community care, particularly with respect to healthcare, I believe that the elderly can continue to contribute if elderly participation in the workforce is encouraged and sociocultural perspectives of the elderly are changed. Furthermore, the elderly can bring about benefits and opportunities in certain sectors, and we need to change our mindsets to recognize these.\nSome argue that the elderly may be a burden to society in that they put a strain on public finances. With old age comes decreased mobility, slower reactions and illnesses, which means that many elderly persons do not work and may require financial and healthcare support from the government. In many countries, the government provides social support and financial support for the elderly, whether in terms of pension or providing medical services. With limited resources, countries have to divert funds away from other sectors to support the elderly, hence giving rise to the view that the elderly are a burden. Moreover, in many countries such as South Korea and Italy, an aging population is an issue which comes hand-in-hand with falling birth rates and hence the growing tax burden is being supported by a dwindling band of younger workers. More than US$5 billion was spent on healthcare for the elderly in Singapore in 2015 as healthcare expenditure for each senior is about four times that for the average person. In Canada, the average amount spent on private and public healthcare services is 3 times higher for a person aged over 65 than an average person. Clearly, one can see that the elderly do pose a considerable burden to public finances.\nIn addition, the elderly are sometimes viewed as a burden in that they place financial and emotional stress on their families. As senior citizens face higher incidence of illnesses, their families are confronted with increasing healthcare expenditure, among many other costs. The working adults have to pay for bills, loans, mortgage, and daily necessities, and hence the financial burden of supporting their elderly dependents will further increase this load. Moreover, the elderly require more time and attention due to factors such as higher fall risk. This further engenders mental and emotional stress in families. In Germany and the United Kingdom (UK), many families cannot afford to provide necessary medical attention to the elderly due to rising healthcare costs. Research conducted by the Lien Foundation in Singapore suggests that the cost of looking after a disabled senior at home, without subsidies, can go up to $3,100, which is an exorbitant cost for the average Singaporean household, which has a monthly household income of $9,293. The alternative of sending the elderly to 24/7 care centres is also ruled out for many families due to the exorbitant prices involved. In this fast-paced society where money is a scarce resource, it is indeed difficult for families to find sufficient time and capital to care for the elderly. Therefore, the elderly may be seen as a burden to their families.\nFurthermore, it is highlighted that the elderly may not possess the relevant skillsets to adapt to a rapidly changing socio-economic landscape. With industrialization and modernisation, new skillsets are required in workplaces and the elderly find it difficult to compete against technologically-savvy youths who have higher productivity. According to National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser, senior citizens admittedly have lower levels of literacy than their younger peers. The decreased economic relevance of the elderly can be seen in many companies, where the average age of Chief Executive Officers has fallen from 59 in 1980 to almost 50 years of age today. Many corporations also prefer youths to older workers as youths are seen to be more creative and efficient. The American Association of Retired Persons or AARP recently published a survey, in which 76% of respondents felt that they face greater difficulty in job-hunting due to their age, presumably because they were seen as \"outdated\" or \"antiquated\" in their thinking. Whether this view is merited notwithstanding, it is arguably true that the elderly are viewed as increasingly obsolete in the economy of tomorrow.\nYet, while the aforementioned challenges may seem overwhelming, it is essential to recognize that the elderly are not inevitably doomed to be a burden to society. Amidst an increasing elderly population in many countries, it has become ever more urgent and important for countries to tap on the pool of elderly as a demographic group which can bring about greater opportunities and benefits. The elderly need not be a burden to society if sound government policies are devised and implemented to encourage the elderly to become economically productive. The elderly, while less mobile and efficient, still represent a large pool of people who can contribute to the economy. Governments can introduce policies to encourage elderly participation in the workforce by providing monetary incentives, as well as retraining and skills upgrading opportunities. For instance, Singapore has the Workfare Income Supplement scheme, which gives older workers higher take-home pay and increased Central Provident Fund contributions. The Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices also uses advertisements and schemes to encourage employment of older workers by changing socio-cultural perceptions of the elderly. By encouraging the elderly to become financially independent, less pressure is placed on governments and families to provide support for the elderly. In fact, the elderly can help to supplement the dwindling workforce in many countries by filling in labour gaps such as in the services industry. From the aforementioned, one can evidently see that the elderly can provide many benefits to society if sound governmental policies are put in place to encourage the elderly to become more independent.\nAnother key aspect of governmental policies which can help alleviate the burden that the elderly put on society is in terms of promoting healthy ageing and encouraging healthier lifestyles. With a healthier elderly population, less will be spent on healthcare costs as there will be fewer illnesses and medical issues in society. Campaigns to encourage healthy dietary practices and regular exercise are useful in shaping a healthy population. Technology, the very tool which has led to the decreased relevance of elderly, should in fact be utilized to help the elderly lead healthier lives. For instance, a group of National Technological University students have devised electronic games that require physical participation from the elderly. These games are already being tested at senior activity centres around the island, and suggest that there is huge potential to encourage the elderly to lead healthier lifestyles. Indeed, if the elderly can be healthy and fit, they will be able to contribute to society much more, rather than be a liability to society. As such, it is certainly not inevitable that the elderly are a burden.\nMoreover, the elderly population need not be a burden to society as they can stimulate certain sectors in a country'seconomy. The elderly population brings with it a diverse range of needs that has given rise to the \"silver industry\". This represents a significant growth sector for economies as businesses can tap on growing demand for geriatric services, medicinal and pharmaceutical services as well as infrastructure and facilities that cater to the needs of the elderly. For instance, in the UK, many households have stair lifts which can help transport older family members up and down flights of stairs. In Japan, buses have been equipped with mobile ramps that cater to elderly on wheelchairs. Singapore has also recently been ranked third out of fifteen Asian-Pacific countries in terms of silver industry market potential, which refers to the potential of a market emerging to serve the unique needs of affluent but aging consumers. All these opportunities represent the many benefits that the elderly can bring to the economy by introducing greater demand for geriatric goods and services. This potential growth sector can lead to economic growth for the society. Clearly, the elderly can also bring about benefits and opportunities, and need not be a burden to society.\nIn conclusion, it is not inevitable for the elderly to be a burden to society. While the elderly can be a burden in certain aspects, sound government policies can help to alleviate this burden and tap on this demographic group to contribute to society. Moreover, opportunities are created with an increasing elderly population. Essentially, the issue of an aging population is a complex one which will not be easy to tackle, but it is important to remember that all of us will one day grow old, and will also experience lower mobility, slower reactions and health issues. Growing old is part and parcel of life, and even if the elderly are a burden in certain aspects, this burden must be a burden that we are willing to carry."

                "website": "https://www.theknowledgeloft.com/gp-essays/gp-essay-18-people-are-placing-too-much-faith-in-medical-science-do-you-agree/",
                "prompt": "\"PEOPLE ARE PLACING TOO MUCH FAITH IN MEDICAL SCIENCE.\" DO YOU AGREE?",
                "text": "\"A gramme is better than a damn.\" The subtle yet incredibly potent phrase is continuously remembered by the members of a seemingly utopian society in Aldous Huxley'snovel \"Brave New World\" whenever they feel unhappy. They spontaneously turn to a gramme of soma, a narcotic touted to be a medical marvel that subdues any undesirable, negative feelings and provides instant gratification. This could arguably be one of the most extreme cases of excessive faith placed upon medical science, if one were to rely on and expect drugs to control one'sfeelings, the central aspect that defines a human. Over the past century, the medical industry has expanded greatly, as researchers have been making great strides in understanding the human anatomy and introducing medical inventions that serve to prolong and enhance life. Coupled with a plethora of public health measures such as control of infectious diseases, clean water and modern sanitation, the average life expectancy of humans has increased tremendously. It can therefore be concluded that medical science has delivered on its promise. The question that now rears its ugly head is whether the burgeoning field of medical science has prompted people to place an inordinate amount of trust on it, to an unrealistic and unsustainable extent. Given the endless possibilities of medical technology, it is highly likely that people would expect it to cure all ailments, or enhance certain features, which may lead to negative repercussions, posing a threat to patients, their families and the medical fraternity. That said however, there are also rare instances in which there is a lack of trust in medical science due to its unpredictable nature.\nAdvances in medical science have provided cures for a wide range of debilitating diseases to the point that maintaining good health is currently taken for granted by many individuals who mistakenly believe that consuming medication or undergoing treatments can substitute a healthy lifestyle. The increased frequency of lifestyle-related maladies such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and insomnia globally suggest that people could be neglecting their health intentionally, when they actually can lower the risks of getting these diseases through lifestyle changes, on the assumption that such illnesses can be kept under control through medical treatments. About half of 117 million American adults are on medication for preventable chronic diseases such as diabetes. According to research conducted by health research firm Quintile IMS, the number of prescriptions filled for Americans increased by an astronomical 85% between 1997 and 2016, from 2.4 billion to 5.4 billion a year, even as the population increased by a mere 21% during this period.  Closer to home in Singapore, 10.5% of the adult population currently receive treatment for diabetes management. Unfortunately, there has been a spike in the number of people diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. The Health Promotion Board estimates that by 2050, 1 in 3 Singaporeans will develop Type 2 diabetes. This worrying trend compelled the Health Minister Gan Kim Yong to declare a \"war\" on diabetes in 2016. It would be valid to presume in this case, that the lackadaisical attitude displayed towards the maintenance of one'sphysical health could be attributed to the overconfidence that people have on the drug-saturated medical paradigm that has manifested recently.\nNext, advancements in technology have enabled us to move beyond solely curing the human body to modifying it to suit one'sneeds. This is the undesirable consequence of the publics\" disproportionate amount of trust in medical science and its ability to satisfy their gripes about their health and wellness. What started out as a simple procedure to correct a broken nose or a cleft lip has given rise to a multitude of unnecessary treatments and procedures ranging from skin tightening to face-lifts. The constant dissatisfaction with the current, less invasive procedures offered by medical technology and the insatiable desire for more innovative, unconventional methods to further enhance the body has fuelled the rapidly evolving cosmetic industry. The blind faith that people place in such risky procedures has also resulted in sky-rocketing costs associated with cosmetic procedures. Dr Doug Steinbrech, a New York specialist performs a new facelift at a cost of an eye-watching $35,000. Similarly, re-sculpting of the face using ultrasound and lasers costs an astonishing $11,000. Despite the hefty price tag attached to these treatments, many willingly opt for them, naively thinking that their imperfections can be corrected. Research conducted by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons suggest that Americans underwent close to 17.1 million cosmetic procedures in 2017 alone. Across the Pacific Ocean, the plastic surgery industry is booming, with more than 22 million undergoing cosmetic surgery in 2017. The warm reception towards such treatments have spurred specialists to push the boundaries of medical science further, out of the naive belief that it could completely change one'slooks. This confidence would later result in the controversial first ever face transplant performed by a French doctor, Dr Dubernard in 2005. In a world that already places crushing, asphyxiating standards on beauty, the risky and unpredictable consequences associated with cosmetics surgeries that people regularly gamble on only serve to prove that medical science is unrealistically viewed as a panacea to all problems.\nApart from the possible obsession with cosmetic surgeries, a surfeit of conviction in untested \"cutting-edge\" research opens up the possibility for such research to be abused and exploited. Research done in stem-cell therapy, cloning, and organ transplants are experimental at best. The results have been inconsistent, and these procedures have not been widely accepted by the medical community. As a result, expecting such genetic engineering processes to improve one'squality of life is quixotic. Nevertheless, as scientists continue to dabble with research of questionable nature, hoping to make a ground-breaking discovery, there is a possibility that ethics and morality will be sacrificed. With the technology to precisely and accurately edit human genetic sequences within reach, designing humans are no longer just a science fiction fantasy. The arrival of CRISPR technology, though still in its nascent stage, has the potential to excise undesirable genes and insert favourable ones into gametes and embryos in a process called germ line engineering, allowing couples to select traits they wish their child to have and potentially turning the concept of designer babies into a frightening reality. Given that the eugenics movement, which essentially proclaimed that all were created equal, but some were more equal than others, had entered the mainstream consciousness as recently as the 19thand 20thcentury, research along these lines might be exploited by the most radical amongst us. Furthermore, the concept is also offensive to many religious groups who believe that it is wrong to \"play God\" by effectively creating and changing life, as well as opposing the law of nature. It can be evinced clearly that the sheer magnitude in terms of expectations placed on biotechnology, could easily raise ethical and moral concerns, especially if it threatens the very essence of human life.\nProponents of medical science would however argue otherwise, stating that faith placed upon medicine and health research is certainly not misplaced, given that it has brought about innumerable benefits to humanity. Its merits span from the early diagnosis and management of life threatening diseases, to the eradication of pandemics that once plagued the world. Admittedly, the positive impact of medical science has been long lasting, which may coax people into accepting it wholeheartedly. Medical science has successfully identified the causes of infectious diseases and destroyed the carriers of such bacteria and viruses. Dedicated research and experimentation have given rise to vaccines and antibiotics to combat such maladies. This was well-demonstrated in the cases of polio and smallpox, where in collaboration with the World Health Organization, medical resources were able to reduce the prevalence of such diseases. The Global Polio Eradication Initiative reduced the number of cases of polio by 99% and more than 2 billion children have been immunized. The negative effects of smallpox were also short-lived as it was officially eradicated in 1980. It has been estimated that at least 20 million people would have died of smallpox had it not been eradicated. People may also pin their hopes on pharmacogenomic research and the concept of personalized medicine, which is administered with the understanding that individuals may have different responses to drugs due to different genes. Medco Health Solutions, one of America'slargest pharmacy benefit managers until it was acquired by Express Solutions in 2011, was leading the way in making the provision of personal genomics services to the masses a reality. It had already achieved successes with personalized treatment of Warfarin, a widely used blood thinner to prevent clots, and Tamoxifen for breast cancer. Essentially, matching the right drugs to the patients not only has obvious clinical benefits, but also makes good economic sense. By reducing the occurrence of misdiagnosis, long hospitalization periods and the need for follow up treatment, personalized healthcare can generate significant cost savings. All of these will ultimately allow patients to direct their own care to some extent, empowering them with a greater sense of freedom and self-reliance, truly heralding a breakthrough in medical science. Advances in personalised medicine would also allow for the treatment of rare disorders and allow the industry to track the development of diseases. For instance, in the United Kingdom, the National Healthcare System is collaborating with academia and industry to analyse the genetic material of persons with rare disorders through the 100,000 Genomes Project. It is hoped that such information will shed light on and save lives from disorders which were previously unknown. Indubitably, the public validation of medical science especially in keeping infectious diseases at bay and enhancing their health by providing personalized medicine is indeed justifiable and in no way a gross exaggeration of our gargantuan trust on medical science.\nIn sum, medical science remains essential and indispensable due to the benefits it has on the well-being of Man. As this branch of science continues to expand, evolve and develop, it is inevitable that mankind would place much of their hopes and utmost faith in it to provide them with enhanced longevity. However, past and present experiences have revealed that this may not necessarily be a wise decision, as it poses risks that may be catastrophic if not cured in time. It is imperative that ethical restrictions be present to act as a moral compass and ensure that our desires and trust do not tip the scale, lest we might find ourselves being reduced to soulless beings, stripped of our mental faculties and perhaps, depending on soma, in the near future."

                "text": "In academic and policy circles, ageing is becoming a hot topic. Ageing is now a global phenomenon which is particularly pronounced in the developed world due to factors such as declining fertility rates and increased longevity. Data by the World Population Prospects suggest that the percentage of those aged 60 and above is set to increase from 9% in 2019 to more than 16% by 2050. The issue of ageing populations has profound consequences for all facets of human life, ranging from poorer economic growth to an increased healthcare burden to changes in voting patterns. As such, countries need to rapidly adapt and establish the necessary infrastructure and policies to meet the needs of their rapidly shifting demographics. There are many ways in which the problem of population ageing can be tackled. One of the solutions would be to tap on the expertise of the immigrant pool to compensate for the ageing – and thus shrinking – labour force. Yet, while immigration has the potential to alleviate the negative effects of population ageing, it is not necessarily the most essential and efficient method as it brings about a host of problems. Therefore, it would be prudent to note that there are other solutions, such as encouraging more births, raising the retirement age and improving healthcare that should be considered and adopted alongside immigration policies to tackle an ageing population.\nThose who claim that immigration is a panacea to the problems associated with an ageing population point to the fact that immigration supplements the shrinking labour force, offsetting the decline in the number of workers as well as lowering the median age of the general population. This will help to protect the government from a loss in tax revenue, as well as ensures that consumption levels are maintained. Many countries around the world including Singapore, the United States, and the United Kingdom are relying on immigration to supplement their ageing populations. Singapore has welcomed a surge of immigrants, with the number of new citizens skyrocketing from an average of 8200 per year in 1987 and 2006, to about 22 102 in 2017. Furthermore, immigration policies can be designed to attract new citizens or transient migrants who have reached adulthood and who possess the skill sets to contribute to the native community. In this way, countries can stand to benefit from having \"instant adults\" to boost their declining population and workforce numbers. This understanding has underpinned the plethora of schemes which Singapore uses to attract \"quality foreign talent\", such as the International Manpower Program of the Economic Development Board and the Scheme for Housing of Foreign Talents. It appears then that immigration is viewed as a highly effective method to counter the negative economic consequences of a rapidly ageing population.\nHowever, the reality is that immigration poses myriad problems as well. Even as immigration is heralded as a solution for economic stagnation, a large influx of temporary migrant workers can potentially depress wages if migrant workers are willing to accept lower salaries. This can be exacerbated by the absence of minimum wages. A labour economics research study published by Harvard University suggested that an influx of 125,000 Cuban migrants to Florida depressed the wages of \"low-skilled, native-born\" workers by 10%-30% in the 1980s. Moreover, the availability of cheap migrant workers can also potentially disincentivise employers from investing in ways to increase productivity. The relatively easy access to cheap foreign workers has been found to be one of the main reasons behind the stagnant productivity growth in Malaysia and Singapore over the past decade. In addition, it can be argued that immigration may pose a threat to the social fabric of the community due to cultural differences resulting in discord between the immigrants and the natives. This is well demonstrated in the case of Singapore, a young, multicultural nation, having only recently gained independence. Her society consists of a patchwork of different races and religions, and the government has spent decades trying to forge a Singaporean identity. However, before the social glue has had time to set, Singapore flung her arms wide open and embraced hundreds of thousands of new immigrants who are oblivious to Singapore'shistory, culture, people, and way of life. As a result, integrating them into the society presents a daunting challenge. The locals may also lack an understanding of the culture of these new immigrants and be offended as a result by certain behaviour. There was an incident involving a family from mainland China seeking mediation over their Singaporean Indian neighbours cooking curry, as they found the smell intolerable. Although this conflict was eventually settled, it generated a public uproar over the issues of immigration into a plural society. If such problems were left undealt with, it could snowball and result in widespread xenophobia. In a similar vein, immigration has been proven to generate considerable social tension elsewhere, such as in France, and the United Kingdom, where there is considerable hostility between the locals and immigrants. Particularly in the United Kingdom, Polish migrant workers have had bricks thrown through their windows and in two cases have had their homes petrol-bombed. Most of the attackers were working-class Protestants, who resented Polish migrants as much for their Catholic religion as for their perceived taking of jobs. It cannot be denied that the presence of immigrants has resulted in increased competition in various areas such as in housing and education, which may promote heightened feelings of resentment and bitterness among the local community. Despite all of these, it must be conceded that the concerns related to immigration can be addressed though political intervention, such as by tightening its immigration framework and putting in place more stringent foreign workforce controls to reduce the influx of new immigrants and foreigners. This, in turn, would make immigration a more viable solution, though it is not the only solution available.\nApart from immigration, there are a variety of other options that governments can consider to supplement the ageing population, one of which would be to encourage more births. Countries can and have implemented measures to facilitate child-bearing and child-rearing. In France and the Scandinavian countries, which have some of the highest fertility rates in Europe, couples are greatly assisted by the government. A French mother has at least 16 weeks of paid maternity leave as well as guaranteed job security and – if she has a third child – a monthly stipend of up to 1,000 Euros for a year. Similarly, in Norway, women are entitled to 10 months of paid maternity leave at their full salary or a year with compensation being about 80% of their salary. Since the policies have been in place for decades, the country'sfertility rates are approaching 2.1, roughly the point where a population is self-sustaining, thereby reducing the need for immigration. Clearly, it is evident that boosting the fertility rate would have a far more pronounced effect on mitigating the effects of an ageing population in the long run.\nNext, there is a trend that is being observed in today'sworld, especially in developed countries and that is the company'swillingness to hire older people. Many organisations recognize that there is a wealth of experience in the elderly that generally goes untapped. Firms organize workshops and skills training programmes to help the elderly remain relevant in the workplace in order to tap on these existing skill sets. This, in turn, renders immigration unnecessary. Examples of such initiatives can be observed in the US, where an association of non-profit groups and the government hold seminars targeted at helping older people hone their skills to increase their employability. In addition, due to the array of retirement options that allow employees to transit gradually to retirement, along with other benefits such as flexible schedules, vetted back-up eldercare and low-impact exercise classes, the National Institute of Health (NIH) of the United States has consistently been ranked as one of the best companies for older workers. This could explain why more than half of their 20,000 workers are aged 50 years or older. These measures would prove to be superfluous, however, if the retirement age is not raised. Across the world, the statutory retirement age has different legal implications: in some countries like Singapore, the retirement age prevents older workers who have not reached the retirement age from being unfairly retrenched on the pretext of old age, while in others workers are guaranteed a pension if they retire upon reaching retirement age. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD), many developed countries have already passed legislation that would increase the retirement age in their countries to at least 67 years from 65 by 2050. Ultimately, raising the retirement age will help to address the problem of a dwindling workforce as well as the impending pension crisis. The notion that the elderly can still contribute meaningfully to the workforce and the economy should be popularised, and the necessary changes should be made to re-integrate them back into the workforce.\nIt is also crucial that governments promote active and healthy ageing through public awareness campaigns and education. Indisputably, a rapidly ageing population will place greater demands on the healthcare system. The World Health Organization warns that the social impact of population ageing could be enormous. It predicts a big rise in cancers, coronary heart disease, diabetes and other lifestyle diseases related to ageing. Health experts are also worried that as people get older, they could become more prone to an increasing number of debilitating conditions unless they keep themselves physically active. In Singapore'scontext, research by the University of Washington'sInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation suggest that Singaporeans spent an average of eight years in ill health even as life expectancy increased to 82. Additionally, research by Duke-NUS Medical School suggests that the percentage of those over 60 years of age suffering from three or more chronic health conditions had more than doubled, from 19.8% in 2009 to 37% in 2017. What this necessarily means is that healthcare systems have had to devote more resources to addressing the needs of the elderly, many of whom will be in and out of hospices. To make matters worse, healthcare costs are on the steady rise and the elderly and their caregivers are struggling to afford essential treatments. Policies which place greater emphasis on community-based care and the prevention and management of chronic ailments are thus more pertinent than ever. Countries and their leaders have responded to this astronomical challenge by publicly funding the healthcare system, best exemplified by England. It subsidizes elderly patients\" medical care expenses through the National Healthcare System and has implemented various programmes like the National Retention Strategy to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of treatment for the elderly. Closer to home, Singapore'sMinistry of Health has introduced a slew of campaigns and financial schemes, such as the $3 billion Action Plan for Successful Ageing, co-payment insurance schemes like Medisave and Medishield to help the elderly cope with medical expenses for age-related ailments. These initiatives will indeed go a long way in addressing the social impacts of a rapidly ageing population.\nIn short, population ageing is in a state of flux today. It is also an intractable problem with no magic silver bullet to solve the issue. As many countries start to experience its pervasive effects, it is vital to consider mitigating the negative aspects of it via a multi-pronged approach, instead of relying on immigration solely to solve the problems associated with population ageing. While immigration seems like the fastest, most feasible way to replace the loss in working adults, in the long run, it may turn out to cause more harmful than beneficial, not to mention that a country cannot depend entirely on immigration as it may not be permanent. Other alternative solutions such as boosting fertility rates, encouraging skills upgrading and providing healthcare and financial support to the elderly should be employed in tandem. Notwithstanding this, immigration, at the moment serves as the most efficient and pragmatic way to supplement the ageing population, but ideally, it has to be complementary to other alternate solutions discussed to inculcate a culture where \"grey is the new gold\"."

                "prompt": "CONSIDER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF HUMOUR IN OUR WORLD TODAY.",
                "text": "Charlie Chaplin once said, \"A day without laughter is a day wasted.\" Thankfully, most of us should be able to live according to Chaplin'sphilosophy quite easily. Humour is such an integral part of our communications that we often employ it without much thought when conversing with others. Whether it is a cheap \"three men walk into a bar\" joke, or a witty retort in the middle of a political debate, humour is a universal concept understood by all people regardless of time and culture. Of course, the more serious-minded of us may find humour a waste of time when there are more productive things to do. While it is true that humour is not appreciated in certain instances, it has much importance to us in societies because of the value it brings to people.\nHumour plays a significant role in our lives as it is a source of entertainment and relaxation. After all, as the saying goes, \"laughter is the best medicine\". It gives us a respite from stressful and tense situations. This explains why comedy films and shows such as Mr Bean and Jack Neo's\"Ah Boys To Men\" are so popular as well as why \"sense of humour\" consistently makes the list of top ten traits people look for in potential life partners. Even in the tense and high-stakes world of politics, humour can be used to great effect. Former US President Ronald Reagan, for instance, was a master of using humour to diffuse tense situations and make his policies more relatable to the people. In justifying his policies of having limited governmental intervention in economics. he explained that the nine most terrifying words in the English language were: \"I\"m from the government and I\"m here to help\"\". When questioned about the mounting US deficit, he said that he was not worried because it was \"big enough to take care of itself.\" During his re-election campaign in 1984, he was debating against opponent Walter Mondale about whether his old age would affect his ability to hold office for another term. Reagan won over the crowd, even evoking laughter from Mondale himself, when he said that \"I will not make age an issue of this campaign. So I am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponent'syouth and inexperience.\" Similarly, Barack Obama evoked humour to counter his Republican opponent Mitt Romney'sargument that the US military having fewer warships was a sign that it had become weaker by pointing out that \"we also have fewer horses and bayonets\". These cases demonstrate how humour is significant in breaking up usually tense or boring situations.\nIn fact, humour can have uses beyond the occasional quip or remark. It can form the entire basis of discussing dull, controversial and sensitive topics. In education, for example, one way O-Level Chemistry students memorize the order of reactivity of metals is to use the sentence, \"King Napoleon can manage all zany fellows since puberty\" (the starting letters of each word represents the symbol of the element in the periodic table so \"king\" is potassium, \"napoleon\" is sodium and so on). Once students hear this nonsensical but amusing line, there is a good chance that they will never forget the pattern of reactivity again. In contrast, memorization through rote learning and brute force often ends up less effective as students become uninterested. Humour might even work for adults too. The rise of news reporting in the US through satire and comedy, such as John Oliver's\"Last Week Tonight\" on HBO and \"The Daily Show with Trevor Noah\" on Comedy Central, has made news interesting for members of the public. This has allowed topics ranging from hot-button issues such as capital punishment and voting rights to those mundane or alien to the average viewer like vaccinations and elections in Mexico and India, to be covered in segments as long as ten to 20 minutes. It also brutally exposes certain contradictions, hypocrisies and errors which public figures make, in ways that mainstream news stations cannot do. In an extreme case, actor and comedian Sacha Baron Cohen acted as fake interviewers in \"documentaries\" like \"The Ali G Show\" and \"Who Is America?\" to coax politicians out of their scripted messages. For instance, in an episode of \"Who Is America?\", Baron Cohen managed to get former US Vice President Dick Cheney—a controversial person due to his involvement in the CIA'suse of torture on suspects—to openly endorse waterboarding. In another episode, he convinces gun lobbyists in the US to support arming children as young as three years old. The use of comedy and satire in these cases show that humour can play a significant role in society in making news entertaining and accessible to people and even in some cases, more accurate.\nNonetheless, there is a time and place for everything and there are certainly occasions where humour ought to play a limited role, or no role at all. In extremely serious and solemn situations such as funerals and court cases, there is not much place for humour. Humour isalsoof little to no value when it is used inappropriately or insensitively. Mocking people for things like race, religion, gender, height, weight, age and disability, for instance, is bullying, because it derives selfish pleasure at the expense of innocent people. Furthermore, it may cause harm to the victims beyond just normal hurt—they might suffer from alienation, depression and may even attempt suicide.Likewise, racist or sexual jokes that are likely to offend others should be avoided, especially in today'shighly globalized world where societies are more diverse than ever. A tactless comment made without any real harmful intent may still be taken the wrong way and this can cause or perpetuate social prejudice and tensions. The comparison that Italian politician Roberto Calderoli made between Italy'sblack minister of integration and an orangutan example, was claimed to have no malicious intent.However, that does not change the fact that such a remark serves to reinforce the racist mindsets which are a major problem in multicultural Italy, and might create a backlash from the insulted group that could spin out of control. For instance, the 2015 Charlie Hebdo shootings in France was a response to the newspaper'spublication of a cartoon that mocked Prophet Muhammad.People have to be careful about how they use humour as the consequences can be damaging if they cross the line. Therefore,there is a time and place for humour, and occasions where it is less significant and indeed, best not to be used.\nIn essence, humour plays a significant part of our communications and ourlives, but it is significant only in certain scenarios and when used appropriately. In more solemn and sensitive scenarios, humour becomes less important as its use is minimised or even eliminated due to social and cultural sensitivities. Ultimately, some types of humour are more meaningful than others. Jokes that are appropriate and made with good taste are the ones that actually add value to our lives, and in this way can play a very big role in making us happy and even to help us make sense of the world around us."

                "prompt": "IS TECHNOLOGY THE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OF GLOBAL POVERTY?",
                "text": "\"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\" This claim, made by acclaimed British science fiction write, Arthur C. Clarke aptly encapsulates the potential benefits that technological advancements bring about and points to an optimistic picture of the endless possibilities of technology in solving many of the world'sproblems. One of the more pressing issues that has taken a toll on governments and the public across the globe is that of global poverty. The World Bank estimates that 1.37 billion people live on less than USD1.25 a day, and 2.56 billion live on less than USD2 a day. With the proliferation of technology and its ability to provide greater access to remote areas, cheaper machine, food production, microfinancing and education, technology has seemingly lifted many out of poverty. Yet, it is not without problems such as being too technical to be handled as well as causing wage depression, and even unemployment. It may also be limited by extenuating circumstances, attributed to poor governance and lack of education, making technology a less effective solution to the problem of global poverty. Given the complexity of global poverty, it would be wise to consider a multi-pronged approach in tackling the problem, instead of solely relying on technology to perform its \"magic\" as described by Arthur C. Clarke.\nWhile people in developed economies tend to have access to shelter, food, and education, the same cannot be said of their counterparts living in developing nations. The emergence of technology like genetically modified crops and information technology have reconstructed the way people in developing countries can step out of their poverty cycle and experience a new lease of life. Food security within impoverished communities has been established with the introduction of the Green Revolution, which refers to the series of research, development and technology transfer initiatives that increased agricultural production around the world, beginning most markedly in the late 1960s. This movements saw the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains, expansion of irrigation infrastructure, modernisation of management techniques, distribution of hybridized leads and synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to farmers. The highly significant development of new \"high-yielding\" wheat cultivated was made possible by advances in molecular genetics. These cultivates, together with other agricultural technologies were introduced to man developing countries including Mexico and India, where nearly a quarter of the population was suffering from malnourishment as a result of poverty and rampant food shortage. The crops distributed to them had undergone DNA modification and were able to resist pests and diseases, and to grow at a faster rate, eventually increases the yield, helping to alleviate the problem of global poverty. Nevertheless, this cutting-edge technology has also received its fair share of criticism as it relies on high-cost machines to increase work efficiency, and this is counter-productive in a sense that, compared to manual labour, these machinery are favoured by companies, and the increased competition is driving the less productive, poor farmers out of the agricultural industry. Even if they were to be employed, it is highly unlikely that they would possess the knowledge or have the experience to operate them. Such technological advancements may also breed avarice among the wealthy, as they choose to patent the crops, rendering the poor helpless when they are unable to pay exorbitant prices for the seeds. As such, the poor would find themselves lagging being in terms of development and would not be able to improve their living standards. Hence, it is evident that while technology has the potential to aid the poor by increasing access to basic necessities, it is unfortunately hampered by several other factors, preventing its effects to be maximised.\nApart from ameliorating the dire effects of the hunger problem, technology, in the form of new media has contributed significantly to combating poverty. The recent advent of the Internet has changed the world dramatically. It functions as a platform for people to reach out and connect with others through a variety of media; it removes physical and geographical barriers. This has made it possible to bring together people from various cultures, regardless of where in the world they may be. The colossal influence that the internet and social media platforms has over the world has been tapped on to support for the needy, be it through donations, volunteer or direct provision of supplies. For example, the Singapore Red Cross has its own website and Facebook page which allows netizens to consistently keep tabs on the humanitarian programmes currently and make online donations or to rally charity campaigns. Other non-governmental organisations also make use of Facebook, Twitter or YouTube to increase global awareness on the issue of global poverty and they garner support. There is no doubt that by employing such forms of media platforms, there have been vast improvements in the level of aid provided to the poor, as exemplified in the case of the Haiti earthquake in 2010, where social media platforms were instrumental in engaging various humanitarian organizations in delivering supplies to the nations and providing the funds for restoration projects. The \"One Laptop per Child\" campaign has also attempted to integrate technology and education, to emphasize people from poorer communities to take greater ownership of their lives by giving them opportunities to learn through a small computer called the \"XO laptop\". This durable, low-cost gadget is wireless and has a powerful screen that can be read in direct sunlight, making it portable for children who go to school outdoors and for those who live in remote region. Although the plan to promote self-empowered education was promising, on hindsight, there were many doubts that arose regarding the development of the initiative in rural areas. For example, in Peru, over 800,000 low-cost laptops were distributed to children, but the direct benefits were not felt due to a myriad of problems, from ill-prepared rural teachers who were unable to fathom, much less teach, with the machines; software bugs that were not fixed affecting the learning; to the lack of electricity in the rural areas and schools to power the laptops. These concerns mar the alluring prospect that technology could potentially eliminate the problem of poverty, and highlight the importance of addressing the other issues that exist on the fringe of the main issue of poverty, such as providing basic infrastructure reassessing the government.\nAs aforementioned, the quality of the government has to be assessed before tackling the problem of poverty, as the reality is that the existence of corruption within most bureaucracies of developing countries makes the elimination of poverty an intimidating task. A country led by inept leaders generally suffers from greater instability and has poorly developed infrastructure. Under their governance, there is mismanagement of resources, resulting in poor and inadequate public services such as healthcare and education, which are vital aspects for a country'sdevelopment. In addition, even if technology were to assist in providing aid in times of need via social media platforms and the Internet, the donations and resources channelled from developed countries to the developing countries might not directly help the poor who need them the most. After the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, a significant proportion of food, medical, and monetary aid failed to reach the victims of the disaster as the Indonesian military looted the essential supplies to sell them in the black market at inflated prices, while the government pocketed the money. The ineffectiveness of technology in eradicating poverty is further reiterated here, what aid offered to poorer countries can be siphoned by the leaders to improve their wealth and status. Therefore, apart from technology, a call for action is certainly required in this instance, to exterminate corruption and put in place proper policies to ensure that aid is rendered to the poor, lest the impoverished be mired further in poverty.\nNext, international alliance and collective will play a major role in improving the current state of poverty. Various governmental and non-governmental organisations at national and community levels can work in tandem to tackle some of the major issues faced by the poor, such as healthcare concerns, and the lack of basic education, as these will eventually go a long way in assisting them to secure jobs, equipped with skills and also in the pink of health. Furthermore, by providing the poor with basic necessities, they would be able to utilize technology appropriately and to its fullest capabilities. UNICEF has been building national capacities for primarily healthcare. Around 270 million children, just over 14% of all children in developing countries have no access to healthcare services. As such, a global leader in vaccine supply, UNICEF purchases and helps distribute vaccines to over 40% of children in developing countries. It has also provided oral rehydration salts for 10 cents per packet to children suffering from dehydration. This two-pronged approach in engaging government aid families is still adopted by UNICEF today, reducing child mortality for those under 5, by almost 50% to date. Initiates to promote education have also been taken as they are key signifiers of positive economic development. The MacArthur Foundation, the Mastercard Foundation and the Human Dignity Foundation are collaborating through partnership in strengthening Innovative Practice in secondary education, issuing a second call for proposals to support lifelong learning opportunities and life skills for underserved youth between the ages of 12 and 19 in East Africa, Nigeria, and India. It is an indisputable fact that in the long run, education would serve well in providing people with better economic opportunities, higher agricultural productivity and cultural thinking skills to help them revenge their current plight and escape the straitjacket of poverty. Clearly, such measures would stand poverty-stricken people in good stead and enhance their quality of life, making it far more effective solution to the problem of global poverty.\nWith all of the above in mind, it must be noted that ever since its use to prominence in the early 20thcentury, technology has been a key aspect in our day-to-day lives, strengthening communications, and bringing work productivity to levels unparalleled in the last century. While technological developments have indeed contributed to mitigating poverty to some extent, the presence of other factors such as corrupt governments and lack of basic education and infrastructure impedes its progress in making a profound difference in the lives of the poor. As such, technology alone cannot be the only solution to the problem of global poverty, because if the root causes of poverty are not addressed, technology can and will only play second fiddle to the battle of poverty. What the poor require is not the complete removal of technology from their lives, nor is it the bombardment of technology in their society. They need to be exposed to technology at a gradual pace, along with other complementary external aid and reform actions, such as increased education and communication in the government. Essentially, a more calibrated approach towards tackling the problem would produce a desired outcome in the decades to come."

                "prompt": "CONSIDER THE VIEW THAT FORMAL EDUCATION HAS DONE LITTLE TO PREPARE STUDENTS FOR TODAY\"S CHALLENGES.",
                "text": "In the past decade, there has been a rising debate surrounding education and its ability to prepare students for our rapidly changing world. People have struggled to attain the right and the opportunity to go to school for centuries, because schooling has often been viewed as the primary gateway towards achieving a good life in adulthood, typically in terms of social status and a stable career. However, with globalization and the mounting demands of the global economy, the demographics of numerous countries and the ways humans interact with one another have evolved, and continue to do so. Suddenly, the seemingly diminished value of the school'stypical products – college graduates and their degrees – has caused the relevance and significance of formal education to come under great scrutiny. Yet, in evaluating how well schools around the globe have equipped students with the necessary credentials, skills and attitudes to handle an increasingly competitive, volatile and dangerous world, one must consider various economic and social factors. From this, one will see that formal education has done a considerable amount to ready the younger generation and potential employees for the challenges faced today.\nA common argument against formal education is that it fails to keep up with the changes of the global economy. The advent of technology is quickly making jobs and content matter taught in schools, particularly universities, obsolete by the time students graduate. This problem is further compounded by the lowered barriers of the movement of labour between nations, such that local graduates are facing greater competition against foreigners with possibly better qualifications and experience, in addition to facing a situation where there is an oversupply of degree holders. This is prominent in numerous sectors. One third of recent Australian Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science graduates for instance, were unable to get full-time employment due to \"weaknesses in IT university education, and strong competition from a globalised IT labour force\", according to the Mapping Australian Higher Education 2016 report by the Grattan Institute. In Singapore, graduate unemployment has risen from 2.6% to 2.9% due to a graduate glut, according to the Ministry of Manpower. The evidence that the current formal education has not equipped students with the right qualifications and the ability to stand out in a pool of other similar graduates is therefore apparent.\nHowever, what is often overlooked is the fact that whether or not in formal education is adequately preparing students for the changing economy and greater competition depends on how it has adapted to these challenges. For example, there are policies and courses put in place to diversify education paths by governments of countries like Singapore and Germany, through increasing the number of opportunities to pursue vocational training as an alternative or supplement to skills training. Tertiary education in Singapore can be in the form of attending polytechnics, where students learn job or industry specific knowledge and other valuable soft skills like presentation and negotiation skills. Even in the traditional route of enrolling in junior colleges, the latter is incorporated into the students\" education in the form of Project Work, and curriculum reviews are constantly carried out to ensure that content matter remains as relevant as possible. In Germany, millions of dollars are pumped into vocational training annually, which the majority of post-secondary students pursue instead of university degrees. As a result, they are equipped with the experience and practical skills desired by employers, and this has helped keep youth unemployment at bay at 7% as compared to other European countries with an average of 40%, as of 2015. Therefore, it is not completely accurate to claim that formal education has not done enough to help students become ready for today'seconomic challenges, because one must take into account the fact that formal education is similarly evolving to adapt to these challenges.\nFurthermore, in light of the increasing racial and religious divides present throughout the world today, formal education is in fact doing its part in minimizing or at least, reducing, these divisions in culturally diverse societies. Most educational systems considers the holistic development of students in all levels of education, implementing various programmes and encouraging students to take up extra-curricular activities. At the elementary level, the Child Development Project (CDP) is a programme spanning multiple states in America, which aims to foster children'sethical, social and intellectual development. Reports have shown that students in CDP schools are more skilled at resolving interpersonal conflicts and engage in more pro-social behaviour. Additionally, extra-curricular activities such as sports, performing arts or community clubs not only help build resilience and resourcefulness, but also help inculcate soft skills such as teamwork amongst students as well, which are definitely vital for surviving in an economy that no longer guarantees job security. However, a more important purpose of these programmes is that they help foster social integration, as students gain a sense of pride and belonging to their community and its people. They also become more tolerant of citizens who are racially, ethnically or religiously different from themselves, which play a part in reducing the alienation of the minority. This is especially important in today'sdangerous world, where terrorism has spread in a large pan due to the isolation of misunderstood or stereotyped communities. These programmes are a part of formal education, and thus it cannot be claimed that formal education has done little to ready the students for today'ssocial challenges as well.\nTo conclude, there is a certain truth to claims that some traditional formal education that focuses only on educating students knowledge have become outdated, and hence irrelevant in readying students for the current globalized world plagued with uncertainty and threat. However, there are other aspects of formal education in several societies – from the elementary to university levels – that have also evolved to tackle these social and economic challenges and have revealed considerably encouraging outcomes. Therefore, formal education cannot be easily dismissed as irrelevant to students today."

                "text": "Many renowned universities such as Harvard are known for admitting students who come from different countries and from different walks of life. The rationale behind this is that their students need to learn how to interact with people with a variety of backgrounds in order to become effective global citizens. Indeed, globalization has made societies today much more diverse since one end of the world is just a plane ride away from the other. However, while the admissions office in Harvard may celebrate diversity, it has to be acknowledged that diversity brings about quite a few challenges as well. Therefore, while the trend towards diversity is largely a positive one, its negative implications cannot be ignored too.\nDiversity is about bringing people who have their own unique ideas and mindsets together. When these people share and exchange their opinions, they may disagree with one another and might even seek to reach a consensus. This is, in essence, democracy because what is the point of \"rule by the people for the people\" if everyone agrees on every single issue? The trend towards diversity in the political arena is a positive one because one has opposition parties who can act as checks and balances against the ruling party as well as representatives of different groups in society. At the end of every British parliamentary elections, the leader of the second largest party is sworn in as Her Majesty'smost loyal opposition. The apparent paradox of \"loyal opposition\" is actually a vital ingredient of a healthy democracy – dissent that is expressed in a reasonable and logical fashion that lends itself to compromise and is ultimately for the public good. Such diversity in viewpoints can help governments make sound decisions as it aids proper evaluation of policies them a variety of perspectives. Likewise, including women as well as minority groups as Singapore has done in its Group Representation Constituency system, helps to ensure that the needs of these often marginalized groups are met. Additionally, having a strong opposition in politics can seem to motivate ruling parties to do the best for the nation as politicians know that unsatisfactory decisions may haunt them during the next elections. Therefore, diversity in governance is a positive development since it has to be ruled by all people.\nNext, another benefit to the exposure of different ways of thinking is the potential for creativity to flourish. Humans are highly social creatures who learn best when interacting with others and who can collaborate with one another to achieve something new. This is why the hallways of Silicon Valley and Bangalore where enterprising immigrants of different nationalities and backgrounds exchange their ideas are the lands of innovation today. This is especially important in a global economy that is gradually shifting from industrialization to more knowledge-based production. Moreover, having a society which is open to diversity attracts the investments of large multinational companies since it means that they are able to send in their professional expats much more easily. This explains why today'smost prosperous cities such as London, Singapore and New York are so welcoming to immigrants. Hence, since the trend towards diversity is what will drive future economic development in the world, it is a positive development.\nOn a more microscopic note, diversity in industries meaning competition as opposed to a single monopoly, is healthy. Competition drives producers to deliver better products and services and keep costs down. The liberalization of telecommunications in Singapore, for example, served to include Starhub and M1 together with Singtel. This move was to the ultimate benefit of consumers who received more choice and better quality. Therefore, diversity in industries improves efficiency in economies and is a positive development.\nAt first glance, one might think that the trend towards diversity in societies is beneficial because the cultural interactions between people can promote a greater understanding and respect between people of different races and religion. Indeed, the shift from ethnocentrism and stereotypes to a more global and multicultural society is a step in the right direction. However, it will be too optimistic to claim that everyone has understood one another and everyone is living harmoniously together. The influx of foreign cultures and values have alarmed cultural preservationists, leading to tensions and conflicts within societies. Radical Hindus, in India for example, have felt that western public displays of affection are unacceptable to traditional Indian culture so they annually harass or even attempt to forcefully marry young couples on Valentine'sDay. The French Law that bans headscarves and face veils in schools has also alienated many of France'sfive million Muslims. A few years back, rioting broke out in a Paris suburb when a police officer checked the identity papers of a fully veiled women. Indeed, social diversity brings about its own set of challenges and these problems are not easily solved. Therefore, while diversity may increase cultural understanding, the social strife it might cause does not make the trend towards diversity a necessarily positive one.\nIn essence, the movement towards diversity may be beneficial politically and economically but the social aspect needs to be examined more closely. Governments will have to embrace diversity but at the same time remain cautious at its negative aspects if they were to truly enjoy the fruits that diversity bear."

                "prompt": "CONSIDER THE VIEW THAT CITIES OF THE FUTURE NEED TO BE DESIGNED VERY DIFFERENTLY FROM THE ONES WE KNOW TODAY.",
                "text": "The modern cities of the 21stcentury are a true testament to the progress of mankind – towering skyscrapers, enormous superstructures and gigantic movements from the cityscapes that we are all familiar with today. Our cities are built to be as space-conscious and efficient as possible, crowding millions of people into buildings and office towers to live, work and play. However, with the greater rate of rural-urban migration, as well as the huge influx of immigrants entering our countries, new cities will have to be built to accommodate all of their needs. Hence ,mankind should take this chance to build cities of the future: cities which are able to adapt and incorporate the technological advances of the present, be built in an environmentally-friendly and sustainable manner, as well as provide areas for greater inclusiveness for the elderly and those with disabilities. These will not have to involve radical and completely different design changes, but instead simple adaptations and adjustments, so that everyone will be able to lead the best life that they possibly can.\nAs a start, cities of the future have to incorporate the technological advances of the present innovations in farming which have led to greater advancements in vertical farming and hydroponics, hence removing the need for large acres of land to be used for farming and allowing for the efficient use of the limited land that we have. Vertical farming will allow for more people to be involved in the production of their own food, making them more conscious of the food that they are eating, hence transforming societies into healthier ones. Spaces for vertical farming incorporated into the design of buildings will make it much easier for families to get started. More importantly, the inclusion of vertical farms in modern buildings will not involve too much of a design or structural change, as it usually just requires racks and stands on existing balconies.\nMoreover, technological advances in the designs of electric automobiles have made them comparable with, if not better than, current petrol and diesel powered options. It is also certain as the environment movement gains further traction, consumer preferences for electric vehicles will shift. However, a big deterrent that still remains is the lack of charging stations, especially for those living in high-rise apartment buildings. Hence, to encourage greater usage of such eco-friendly vehicles, more changing stations can be built at the carparks of apartment buildings, or even quick charge stations in replacement of petrol kiosks, akin to the trials that Tesla is currently conducting in the United States. Additionally, new buildings and shopping malls should be designed to allow for complete automation. Allowing robots and new technology to completely take over the role of humans in the service industry may be something completely different, but if buildings are to be designed for maximum efficiency, this will be the way forward. Incorporating current innovations with technology and designs of the future will allow for maximum efficiency and comfort in the cities of the future, something which will require new and different designs, compared to cities of today.\nNext, as we progress further into the future, the impact of global warming will be much greater. We will hence have to move cities further inland, due to the rising sea levels and receding coastlines. With hurricanes and earthquakes happening more and more often in today'sworld, buildings will need to be built and designed to withstand these disasters. This may lead to a change in many designs, building houses and commercial buildings shorter to prevent collapse, or using new, stronger materials in the building process.\nFurthermore, buildings of the future should be built to be as eco-friendly and sustainable as possible. Incorporating solar panels into the roofs and sides of buildings and creating systems where water is reused for a variety of purposes are currently underway. However, more can be done to increase the effectiveness of these systems, such as designing buildings to capture maximum sunlight, or incorporating localised water purification and collection plants, so that water can constantly be reused and recycled. Designers may even consider incorporating ways of collecting wind energy, placing these turbines at higher floors to capture large amounts of wind. These efforts to encourage sustainable living will gradually help to reduce our carbon footprint, hence restricting our impact on the environment, and reducing the negative impact of global warming.\nFinally, the rise of greying populations worldwide as well as growing urban populations means that cities of the future have to be built with greater inclusiveness for those with disabilities, as well as the elderly. The building of cities that incorporate the needs of the disabilities involve minor structural inclusions such as ramps and lifts to allow those in wheelchairs to move around easily, or even making doors slightly translucent, so that the deaf will be able to determine if someone is behind a door, before opening it. Although these are already present in some buildings, they need to be incorporated into all cities and spaces. Designers should be able to anticipate the needs of the people that will be living in the cities, and those with disabilities should not be overlooked. Cities of the future will need to have signs in Braille for the blind, larger walkways so that the deaf are able to walk side-by-side and sign to each other at the same time. Current cities are only being built to cater to 99% of the population, but we need to remember that the 1% is a crucial part of our communities and societies as well. Similarly, with our growing elderly population, urban designs should provide areas with high elderly populations, more hospitals and palliative care centres should be built, to cope with the greater demand for them. There have been trials in Europe merging childcare and eldercare centres, and this has been proven to be beneficial in the mental wellness of the elderly, as social interaction lowers the risk of dementia and depression. The merger and incorporation of these seemingly different facilities is indeed radical, but has proven to be beneficial to the most overlooked segments of urban cities today. Hence, designers of the future should consider similar ideas in order to cater for greater diversity in cities.\nIn essence, the cities of the future need not be designed completely differently. Instead, they should be designed with minor adjustments made to better suit the changing needs of the people in the time and age, incorporating new designs and innovations, while remaining inclusive and not neglecting any sector of society. In an age where the green agenda needs to take priority, cities need to be built in a way that they too can become carbon sinks for the world. With these adjustments and adaptations in place, each and every person will find themselves in a city which they can best live, work and play in – a city which they will be proud to call home."

                "prompt": "\"ENTERTAINMENT, NOT TRUTH, IS THE PRIORITY OF THE MEDIA TODAY,\" COMMENT.",
                "text": "Will Rogers once said, \"All I know is just what I read in the papers, and that'san alibi for my ignorance.\" It is now fashionable to degrade the media for obscuring verifiable facts that is in the public interest to be made aware in favour of providing amusement and enjoyment to its audience. However, it is important to recognise that media is not a homogenous collective and the priorities of the media cannot be reduced to a simple dichotomy. From mainstream media to para-journalism, to New Media, various forms of media have varying priorities, and this is dependent on how they generate profit and the desires of their target audience.\nWhile mainstream media, which refers collectively to various large mass news media that are capable of influencing a large number of people, and both reflect and shape prevailing currents of thought, does at times obfuscate the truth, this may not be because it prioritises entertainment or strictly speaking the pleasure of its readership. It is arguably true that mainstream media sources have devoted more resources to entertainment news, rather than news that strictly concerns public interests. A quick perusal of The Straits Times suggests that more sections of the newspaper are dedicated to \"lifestyle news\", which covers celebrity news, travel tips and food recommendations or recipes. The fact that major mainstream news sites like the British Broadcasting Company (BBC) and Cable News Network (CNN) ran widespread coverage on a plump rat being extracted from a manhole in Germany suggests that amusing readers has perhaps become a greater priority than ever before. Whether it has overtaken bringing the truth to light, however, is still under question. Furthermore, it should be acknowledged that mainstream media does also tend towards sensationalism and \"excessive coverage\" in order to sustain their viewership. For instance, following the release of a report on carcinogenic processed meat by the World Health Organization, mainstream media coverage of the report and its contents were overblown and often distorted the findings of the report. Even The Straits Times is guilty of sensationalizing reports of crime. This is presumably because mainstream media sources, especially those which use online mediums, tend to sensationalize important news to get \"clicks and likes\", which in turn drives up their advertisement revenue. That said, while sensationalism distorts the truth, this does not directly mean that entertainment is prioritised by the media source. In this case, the angle taken by mainstream media sources hardly brings any pleasure to its viewership due to the nature of the news reported. Nonetheless, for every demonstration of poor journalistic quality by mainstream media, the same mainstream media sources demonstrate their commitment to the truth. CNN correspondent Jim Acosta, for instance, was evicted from the White House in November 2018 in an admirable attempt to call out and question President Donald Trump about \"half-truths\" peddled throughout the course of his presidency. Instead of a simple dichotomy between entertainment and truth, I venture to argue that mainstream media are simply peddling agendas, with entertainment and truth alternatively taking precedence depending on how it fits into their agenda.\nApplying the same set of criteria to para-journalism, which refers to journalism that is heavily coloured by the opinions of individual reporters, it appears that this form of media seems to prioritize entertainment over the truth. \"Tabloids\" which fall under this category care little about public affairs, and instead veer into stories about everyday life: about its disruptions and exaltations, about crime, illness, the celebrity, the damsel in distress, the hero and the rescue. They are about unapologetically appealing to the emotions of the public, and glossing over the complexities of public life. Amal Clooney, renowned international humanitarian lawyer, enjoyed extensive coverage for \"showing off\" her \"baby bump\" and her \"courtroom attire\" at a court hearing about the Yemeni humanitarian crisis. Clearly, para-journalists pay little heed to more important issues in their bid to feed the insatiable need of their audience for entertainment and gossip. Against the backdrop of a parliament flailing in the face of Brexit, tabloids like the Daily Express have instead chosen to cover Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle and her many controversies, even touting her as \"Duchess Difficult\". Are these media sources at least accurate in their reporting (never mind their obsession with covering the glitzy and glamorous) or do they compromise the truth in their pursuit of pleasure? It appears that tabloids often pay lip-service to the notion of truth – the feud narrative between Meghan Markle and Kate Middleton has been thoroughly debunked by Buckingham Palace, and rumours about her being difficult with staff have not been verified with empirical evidence. It appears that parajournalism is a form of media which has taken its desire for entertaining material to the extreme, and completely forsaken the truth in the process. Unlike mainstream media, which often pushes a political agenda to further their own interests, para-journalists simply benefit from a readership that constantly desires entertainment. It would thus make sense for such forms of media to prioritize entertainment over telling the truth.\nFinally, I venture to argue that New Media, which refers to interactive digital media that incorporates two-way communication, tends to prioritise telling the truth over the amusement of its readership. Whether it successfully does so is another question. Alternative media like Wikipedia and Wikileaks for instance, have presenting the truth at the heart of what they do. Wikipedia allows its curious readership to discover the truth about a wide range of topics under the sun, whereas Wikileaks publishes news leaks and classified media provided by anonymous sources with the intention of challenging narratives peddled by mainstream media. Evidently, rather than creating a fictional narrative that is meant to amuse, alternative media prefers to challenge conventional narratives with the intention of eventually uncovering the truth. This is because Wikipedia profits off telling the truth as users who trust its reliability and believe in its purpose donate an amount of USD $15 on average. That being said, social media platforms, which are also included under the umbrella term of \"New Media\", are also in danger of compromising the truth for entertainment. The nature of social media platforms and their business model means that algorithms pick up on the preferences of individual users, and thereafter promote articles or advertisements that it believes these individual users are inclined towards. This extends towards other issues in the public sphere when algorithms used by social media platforms contribute to confirmation bias; users are fed articles that reaffirm their existing views, which to a certain extent reaffirms them and brings about pleasure, be it in the form of self-righteous anger or otherwise. 47% of Conservatives are likely to see Facebook posts aligned to their own views, according to a Pews Research report. Again, as mediums under the umbrella term of \"New Media\" are so diverse in their motivations, whether New Media prioritises the truth over entertainment depends on how these motivations fit into their business model and align themselves with the profit incentive.\nIn a world where large media platforms seem increasingly obsessed with the hilarity of the trivial, and increasingly eager to broadcast their interest, it may appear that entertainment value has displaced the truth as a priority of the media. I venture to argue, however, that media networks are diverse and like individuals, cannot be tarred with the same brush. Their priorities are predicated on the priorities of their readership and their priorities as profit-generating businesses; if the public desires entertainment over truth, this is what the media will provide, for after all, we get the media that we deserve."

                "prompt": "\"THE WORLD WOULD BE A BETTER PLACE IF RELIGION DID NOT EXIST.\" WHAT IS YOUR VIEW?",
                "text": "When Friedrich Nietzsche famously proclaimed that \"God is dead\" in the 19th century, he was expressing a growing sentiment that the significance of religion in society was on a decline. Indeed, Karl Marx went even further to dismiss the function of religion in people'slives by calling it \"the opiate of the masses\". While there is no doubt that religion has been a source of tension, conflict and discord among people throughout human history, the claim that the world would be a better place if it did not exist is too absolutist. It would also be a parochial view as it fails to take into account the many positive benefits religion has brought to mankind such as providing solace and comfort in times of distress, providing moral direction in an age of uncertainty and offering us hope in a world that is increasingly fraught with fear and insecurity. I do not therefore agree that the world would be a better place if religion did not exist, and would in fact argue that things could be a lot worse if not for the stabilizing effects of religion.\nObservers who hold the view that the world would be a better place without religion point to the litany of wars, conflicts, and strife which have seen perpetrators invoke the name of religion to advance their various causes and justify their atrocities. From the Crusades which pitted Christian armies against Muslim ones to the Thirty Years\" War which tore Europe apart with the Protestant-Catholic schism; from the ongoing violence between Hindus and Muslims in South Asia to the protracted Arab-Israeli conflict in the Middle East, it appears that religion in its various guises has been the cause of much human suffering. Additionally, societies that have ruled people by religious precepts often end up abusing human rights and freedoms on the basis of religion. A case in point is the gender apartheid policy enforced during the extremist fundamentalist Taliban regime in Afghanistan. By claiming divine sanction and religious right, the Taliban misused the Muslim faith as the basis for its appalling treatment of women who were denied basic human dignity. This is not just limited to Islam: during the American Civil War, many Southerners evoked passages from the Bible to justify the inhumane practice of slavery. Elsewhere in Uganda, the Lord'sResistance Army have used the Ten Commandments and the desire to create a Christian caliphate of sorts in Central Africa to justify their deplorable actions, which include the recruitment of child soldiers, child-sex slavery and murder. Hence, critics of religion believe that because religion is often used as a vehicle to promote conflict and violence, it is unnecessary and has become incompatible with modern ideals of world peace, freedom and equality.\nAnother oft-cited reason for why religion has little place in our modern world is the notion that with the advent of science and technology, man no longer need to be dependent on religion to provide answers for previously unexplained \"mysteries of the universe\". Many of the teachings in the various faiths are predicated on faith and belief, rather than facts and reason, and opponents of religion assert that this runs counter to modern scientific thought. Some view religion as a primitive attempt to understand nature and the world at large, and that it has since been superseded by scientific inquiry. They therefore conclude that religious beliefs, founded in superstition and ignorance, are at odds with scientifically-proven evidence and merely perpetuate flawed ways of thinking onto future generations.  Some conservative American states are considering including creationism in the curriculum, or at least allowing teachers who introduce creationism as a legitimate scientific theory avoid legal liability. If these measures are passed, there would be a direct impact on the way science is taught, and consequently how the leaders of tomorrow perceive the natural world. In recent years, the scientific community has indeed been growing louder in their denunciation of religion as seen by the publication of such bestselling books as Richard Dawkins\" The God Delusion and Christopher Hitchens\" God is Not Great: How Religion Poisons Everything. As such, with the alleged clash of science and religion, some hold the view that our world would be better off without religion as it poses as a hurdle to rational and logical thinking.\nIn similar fashion, opponents of religion assert that religion has no place in an increasingly secular world which is built upon the concept of the separation of church and state. In most democracies, there is a growing wariness of how religion can creep into the political sphere and affect major national decisions. The argument is that religion should be kept out of politics and the public sphere as we should not impose our own personal and private religious beliefs onto others in society, since it has the potential to infringe on the human rights of individuals or create divisions This can be observed in the United States, where the debate over safe access to abortion has at times devolved into a one. This understanding underpins the government'sdesire to keep religion out of the public space in Singapore. While Article 15 of the Constitution guarantees the right to \"profess and practise (one\"s) religion and to propagate it\", it is qualified by Article 15(4) which guarantees freedom of religion only insofar as it does not contradict other laws relating to public order, health or morality. This sort of \"accommodative secularism\" was introduced precisely because founding father Lee Kuan Yew believed firmly that while the freedom of religion should be enshrined in order to recognize the plurality of Singapore, freedom from religion was crucial in preventing destructive competition between the different religions.  Thus, to those who regard religion in a negative light, religion was, and is, one additional aspect within society apart from race, gender, sexual orientation that segregates people and keep them apart. Because religion often inflames passion, self-righteousness and intransigence over ultimate truths, it is arguable that without religion, there would be one less source of tension in our already problematic and conflict-ridden world.\nYet, notwithstanding the above arguments, the claim that the world would be a better place without religion fails to take into consideration the many benefits that religion accrues both to the individual and to society at large. With regards to the thesis that religion has no place in our world where scientific thought has become dominant, this is also the exact argument why religion is even more needed in our society today. Today, scientific research is advancing at breakneck speed and pushing moral boundaries and extending new frontiers in the process. This is especially true in the field of biotechnology and genetic engineering, where issues such as stem cell research, cloning, cross-species transplant surgery and designer babies are all no longer merely the stuff of science-fiction novels and movies. In order to ensure that we do not violate the moral values which we hold close to heart or devalue the sanctity of life, we urgently need the moral principles upheld by religion or at least its moralistic framework to act as a moral check-and-balance to curtail the excesses of scientific research and scientific hubris. Religious and moral values must draw the lines and set the parameters under which science must fall, without which, the danger that the frenetic pace of scientific research might erode and outstrip our basic moral sensibilities is always present. Even outside the realm of science, the moral guidelines that underpin religion are imperative to serve as a moral compass to inform our decisions with reference to such complex issues as abortion, capital punishment, drugs and euthanasia. In tandem with secular education, we need religion to inculcate and develop moral values within people: Buddhism teaches benevolence to all living creatures; the Bible preaches against adultery, murder, greed and other societal vices; Islam teaches peace and respect for fellow human beings. Without religion to provide a much-needed moral voice, our society may well degenerate into a world where moral values are seen as secondary, or worse, irrelevant and unnecessary.\nFor society, the earlier argument that religion promotes division and gives rise to a \"us versus them\" mentality needs to be balanced by the fact that religion plays an important role in our world today as a unifying force, creating to hold people together in communities where individuals feel safe, accepted and respected. Organized religions foster a deep sense of community among their followers, and the moral and cultural common ground of these communities makes them attractive to people who hold similar values. Religious festivals such as Thaipusam, Hannukah, Easter and Hari Raya witness people coming together in a show of solidarity and community bonding. As a consequence, religion does provide a measure of civil order by nurturing a sense of belonging among people, which is far more desirable in preventing violence and conflict than societies with no central guiding principles save that of materialism and self-centredness. Indeed, many religions advocate practices that place helpful limitations on the behaviour of their adherents. Teachings such as the Ten Commandments in the Torah and the Bible, and the Middle Path in Buddhism, reject extremism and embrace moderation, leading many to view them as positive influences which potentially protect adherents from the destructive or even fatal excesses to which they might otherwise be susceptible. Many, if not all, religions promote peace, and the unfortunate fact that conflicts take place in the name of religion is more a reflection of how a minority of believers have misconstrued and distorted certain doctrines in their religions either out of misguided teachings or to serve their own narrow and selfish agendas. This is therefore an indication of our innate human nature rather than an indictment of religion as an institution in society. Hence, religion can and does serve a useful purpose in modern society in this aspect.\nIn addition to the role that religion plays in the areas of community identity and moral guidance, religion also has a cherished place in society because of the positive impacts which are manifested in practical and concrete ways. By championing the universality of humanity as a race with shared values, dignity and respect, religion often brings out the \"human\" side of mankind in the areas of charity, compassion and altruism for the betterment of humankind. The  2018 Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami witnessed international aid coming from non-Muslim organizations like the Salvation Army in the well-intentioned provision of humanitarian aid; Christianity is noted for the founding of many missionary orphanages and schools; Buddhist welfare organizations are often at the helm providing food and medical supplies to the needy. In fact, the most well-known international humanitarian organizations – the Red Cross and the Red Crescent – were initially established as religious outfits to provide humanitarian aid and comfort in a suffering world. Offshoots of organized religion, such as A Rocha'sEcochurches in the United Kingdom, also lead efforts to promote conservation of the natural environment. Formal research also suggests that religion can be a force for good as it promotes a sense of engagement with the community. Research conducted by the Religious News Service suggest that religious people are three to four times more likely to engage in civic activism, be it volunteering with grassroots organisations or donating money to a selected social cause. In today'sworld which places great emphasis on profit-making, personal and corporate goals, selfish materialism, it can be argued that religion is more needed than ever to teach us to think and act beyond the narrow confines of our own comfortable worlds.\nBesides the positive functions of religion at the societal level, religion also meets many needs for the individual. Although much has been made about how religious faith is at odds with rational analysis, many famous thinkers and intellectuals actually found their way to God through the path of cognitive evaluation and rational analysis. Prominent figures such as C.S. Lewis, Francis Schaeffer, and Antony Flew have written extensively on how the teachings of religion most closely describe the realities of the world we live in, with both Lewis and Flew being staunch advocates of atheism before converting to Christianity after weighing the historical and intellectual evidence for the existence of God. Beyond cognitive reasoning, religion also taps into the emotional wellspring of our existence by providing deeply-satisfying emotional experiences. From the singing of traditional hymns to the practice of solitary meditation; from the trance-like states produced in such practices as the Whirling Dervishes to the graceful motions of yoga; believers of religion are able to find emotional relief and fulfilment by participating in such rituals and acts. But it is at the spiritual level that religion most attend to the needs of people. Through postulating a reality which includes both the natural and the supernatural, both the seen and the unseen; both the temporal and the eternal, religion helps man in his search for meaning and answers to life'sfundamental questions that science, technology and materialism have not been able to provide adequate answers. Why do we suffer? Why are we here? What happens after death? Such issues as the human condition, the purpose of human existence on earth, the afterlife, can only be answered by religion and faith in God that transcends our finite, material and physical existence,  providing hope in an eternal life. But even in this life, religion also fills a spiritual gap that gives believers strength and resilience in the difficult times. Abraham Maslow'sresearch after World War Two revealed that Holocaust survivors tended to be those who held strong religious beliefs, suggesting it helped people cope in extreme circumstances. This was most famously enunciated in Viktor Frankel'smoving book entitled \"Man'sSearch for Meaning\", detailing his experience with the importance of religion in his survival of the concentration camps of the Holocaust. In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks, what shone through was that instead of renouncing religion bitterly, many turned to God for solace and comfort. As can be seen, in today'sworld wrought with conflict, disasters, and uncertainties, religion has not declined in relevance, but instead increased as it becomes embraced as a coping mechanism for people in their grief and despair.\nFinally, in our current frantic pace of life, religion provides an avenue for the fatigued and the frustrated. As a result of technology and globalization, a whole slew of health-related problems have emerged in modern society, with depression, stress and burnout being just a few of them. Many stressed-out individuals have been known to take time off from their hectic work schedules to be alone for reflection and contemplation, often turning to religion for respite. In Singapore, retreat centres such as the Catholic Spirituality Centre and the Maranatha Retreat are becoming increasingly popular among working adults who seek havens to rest, recharge and restore their personal ecologies in a world away from the everyday busy routine of life'sdemands and stresses. Catholic churches, Buddhist temples, Hindu temples are also witnessing more people entering their sacred sanctuaries during lunchtime on a workday or after work to pray and seek rest and comfort. Thus, religion can be said to provide a much needed stabilizing and calming effect in our society that is fast being deprived of assurance, direction and security.\nIn a world where the winds of globalization are blowing strong and the domination of science is growing deep, we desperately need religion as an anchor to provide a sense of identity and community and as a compass to guide us and offer navigation in the uncharted waters of new scientific discoveries. Granted, religion has been used to justify much tension, violence and human suffering but we do need to also acknowledge the many positive benefits it has brought to mankind both at the societal and individual levels. Getting rid of religion would not only fail to solve many of our current problems, but would remove a much-needed institution in a world increasingly fraught with fear and insecurity and marked by a culture of excess."

                "prompt": "SHOULD GOVERNMENT POLICIES BE CONCERNED MAINLY WITH ECONOMIC GAINS? DISCUSS WITH PRIMARY REFERENCE TO YOUR COUNTRY.",
                "text": "\"The measure of a civilised country is how it treats its weakest members.\" This oft-cited quote by many including Plato, Gandhi and Pope John Paul II, reiterates the notion that for any country, adequate attention must be given to meet the needs of those who may not necessarily benefit from the economic and material progress of that society. The question lies in the extent to which economic gains should be the primary concern of government policies, especially when the pursuit of economic growth can lead to unintended consequences such as income inequity and harm to the environment. Yet, while I acknowledge the need to be aware of such potential pitfalls, I would argue that economic gains should be the main concern of government policies because the aforementioned issues require a country to be economically stable and prosperous to mitigate and resolve in the first place.\nA starting argument in favour of pursuing economic gains is that the basic duty of any government is to ensure the physical and material well-being of the people under its care. And in order for these fundamental aims to be achieved, the development of a country'seconomy is paramount. In the case of Singapore, this is well-understood and relentlessly pursued by the government. Since Singapore achieved independence in 1965, the government has not only been conscientiously implementing policies to ensure that the country'seconomy provides Singaporeans with a high standard of living, but it is also constantly looking ahead and planning so that Singapore'seconomy remains competitive regionally and globally for the future. As one of the \"four Asian tigers\", Singapore now has the world's3rd highest GDP per capita, the world'sbusiest port, and is the world's4th largest financial centre. With a growing economy comes improved public amenities and infrastructure, which in turn leads to a more satisfying standard of life for its citizens. This is similarly replicated in China. As its economy grew by leaps and bounds, it lifted between 600 million to 800 million citizens out of rural poverty, enhancing their standards of living. With a growing economy comes improved public amenities and infrastructure, which in turn leads to a more satisfying standard of life for its citizens. Hence, it is undeniable that before any other objectives can even be considered or actively pursued, a healthy and growing economy must first and foremost be a key goal for the government to achieve.\nAnother reason that economic gains should be the primary focus of government policies is the fact that a strong economy ensures political stability, which makes the governance of the country more effective, allowing for the implementation of long-term policies that further the progress of the nation. This has been proven true time and time again in history in countries as diverse as South Korea, Brazil, Malaysia and Taiwan.  While it is argued that for Singapore, political openness and freedom largely take a backseat compared to economic development, it can be countered that it is precisely because the government has been consistently able to secure rapid economic progress for the country that it has earned performance legitimacy, and therefore now has the liberty and space to move towards becoming a full-fledged democracy. A weakened economy, on the other hand, invariably leads to political backlash,es which makes it difficult to govern a country properly. The decline in the price of petrol, and the consequent collapse of Venezuela'soil dominated economy, ushered in an unprecedented political crisis in 2017, with no end in sight.  as was seen in the example of the United States government shutdown in 2013, which was largely caused by America'seconomic woes. Thus, an economically secure country should be the principal concern of the government for the crucial reason that this leads to Singapore being more politically stable, and allowing for the governance of the country to be smooth and effective.\nIn the same vein, economic gains should be prioritized by pursued as a main concern of governments policies, as these lead directly or indirectly to social stability within the country. Considering firstly the direct impact of economic growth for social stability, we find that with less poverty, the incidence of crime falls, and this brings about greater social security for the people. Economic gains and material improvements in the standard of living also do much to remove the many grievances that people in more impoverished countries experience – hunger, lack of housing, unemployment, disease. And these social and economic ills have the potential to result in social instability by allowing public discontent, anti-social behaviour and even extremist ideologies to fester as individuals grow more desperate. In Singapore'scase, on a macro-level, it is no coincidence that its much-lauded economic performance has a direct correlation to its low crime rates. As an eminent scholar, Kishore Mahubani, formerly the who is also Dean of the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, wrote in a recent article, the primary reason that Singapore experiences social stability is that the government has created an \"ecosystem\" that resulted in a high level of personal safety, and one essential element of this \"ecosystem\" is the absence of desperate poverty. Although he also acknowledges in the same article that economic growth does not automatically lead to a reduction in poverty, statistics have proven that the converse is very likely to hold true: that lacklustre economic development invariably leads to higher crime rates and higher potential for social disturbances as witnessed in places like Mexico, Lesotho and Nepal.  This is replicated on a micro-level. Researchers evaluating the impact of a demobilization, disarmament and reintegration programme based in Liberia observed that recidivism rates for former mercenaries decreased when they were offered employment opportunities and resources Indeed, because economic gains often translate into less poverty and less desperation which then leads to greater social security, it can be argued that achieving economic gains should be a top priority for the government.\nHowever, despite the fact that economic gains do bring about a higher standard of living, more effective political governance and greater social stability, there is also a need to recognise that rapid economic growth can, and does, also generate certain negative side-effects that governments do well to take note of. Critics, for instance, highlight the fact that although Singapore has an impressive economic growth track record, it also has one of the world'shighest Gini coefficients, which is a figure that measures the income inequity levels of countries. The income disparity in Singapore is further accentuated by statistics which reveal that the bottom 10% of Singaporean households earn $570 a month, while the top 10% of Singaporeans earn $13,581 a month. Yet, while it is true that this wide gulf is partly caused by the Singapore government'sbreakneck pursuit of economic gains, it must also be noted that the government does recognize this issue and has channelled much of Singapore'sfinancial gains from past decades back to helping the needy and disadvantaged in recent years. A good example of this is how in the economic recession of 2008-2009, the Singapore government was able to dip into its reserves to draw S$4.9 billion to fund two extraordinary measures such as the Jobs Credit and a Special Risk-Sharing Initiative to mitigate the impact of the economic downturn.  Singapore'sBudgets of the last few years also have also kept the social needs and welfare of the people. The budget allocated to ministries such as the Ministry of Social and Family Development and Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth has increased by 100%, from $15 billion in 2009 to $30 billion in 2018. New schemes such as Careshield Life have been steadily introduced as their primary focus the social needs and welfare of the people, with billions of dollars being harnessed to fund community initiatives such as ComCare to help to address the diverse needs of Singapore the needy. In light of this, it can be argued that economic gains actually do lead indirectly to social stability as the monies generated provide the means to look after areas of society that the government is obliged to look into. Therefore, economic gains should be the main concern of the government, even as it acts to ensure that those who may not be benefiting from the economic gains are given the help and assistance that they require.\nOn another note, detractors of the position that economic gains should be the primary concern of the government opine that, more often than not, these economic gains come at the expense of the environment. When governments make industrialisation and modernisation a top priority, environmental concerns and conservation inevitably almost always become marginalised. A prime example of this would be India, which has enjoyed a GDP growth rate of 6 to 7% since 1991. Yet, although it has one of the world'shighest rates of economic growth, India is also notorious for the vast environmental damage that economic development has wrought within the country. As of 2019, 22 of the world's320 most polluted cities are found in India; and life expectancy has decreased by 2.6 years due to air pollution. The Ganges river is one of the most polluted in the world, and close to 640 000 die every year due to water pollution. Similarly, 40% of China'slakes and water sources are contaminated with chemicals from factories; numerous species of wildlife have become extinct, most notable among them being the Yangtze River Dolphin. But thankfully, in contrast, the situation in Singapore is more optimistic. While it cannot be denied that economic progress at times come at the cost of the environment, the Singapore government has assiduously worked hard to balance this tension between pursuing economic gains and pursuing environmental protection by using the financial gains it has amassed through sound economic policies to map out and implement strategies to ensure sustainable living within the country. For instance, since 2012, the Housing Development Board has rolled out a $31 million drive to install solar panels in 30 neighbourhoods, and it is currently in the process of turning its youngest townships such as Punggol, Bidadari and Tengah into real-time test beds for the newest energy-saving innovations. The Solar Energy Institute of Singapore is leading the research and development in the solar energy sector, with the support of the Economic Development Board and the National Research Foundation of Singapore, among others. Many of these initiatives to protect the environment can only come about because of the economic gains that the Singapore government has achieved for the country which then pave the way for these projects to be adopted.\nIn the final analysis, while we acknowledge that the government has a duty to look into legitimate concerns that economic gains can lead to undesirable consequences, it must also be recognized that governments must first and foremost ensure the economic viability of the countries they lead.  This is for the simple reason that without economic security being achieved in the first place, essential services cannot be provided. A strong argument can therefore be made for economic gains to be the main concern of the government, as this gives it the financial and political means to implement policies which address other aspects of society such as income inequity and environmental conservation, as the case of Singapore has adequately shown."

                "prompt": "\"YOUNG PEOPLE TODAY HAVE NEVER HAD IT SO GOOD.\" IS THIS TRUE OF YOUR COUNTRY?",
                "text": "Strawberry generation\", \"Generation Me\", \"I generation\" – these are but some of the labels that the current generation of young people in Singapore have been tagged with. These terms reflect a view held by some that Singapore'syouth grow up in sheltered, comfortable environments and enjoy high standards of living – a far cry from the struggles and hardship that the older generations had to overcome. While this view is not an unreasonable one, we must also consider the fact that youths today also face challenges in a world that is becoming increasingly uncertain. The prevailing set of challenges in the political, economic and social domains may be radically different from those in the past, but they are no less daunting and pernicious. As such, I do not fully agree that young people in Singapore lead easier lives than ever before.\nProponents of the view that young people have never had it so good until today point to the abundant education opportunities made available to youths today. It is undoubtedly true that compared to past generations, youth enjoy far greater access to learning in today'sday and age. In Singapore'scontext, the government has gradually introduced a greater number of education bursaries and scholarships offered to students from less-privileged backgrounds to ensure that the education system remains a meritocratic one that rewards those who work hard, while not denying access to those who may not afford education. This is a vast improvement from the past where it was not uncommon for young people to skip school because of the need to stay at home to look after their siblings or to work in order to contribute to the monthly household income. Even if they could go to school, the education system in the early years of Singapore'sindependent years was largely focused on providing public education to the masses and conformity and uniformity were the norm. Moreover, different learning needs and speeds were often neglected, and crucial skills like critical thinking were deemed as unimportant. Today, however, in order to cater to a variety of talents and learning abilities, the government has created diverse education routes and pathways in recent years. The musically or artistically inclined can now choose to pursue their secondary education in the School of the Arts (SOTA), while budding athletes can opt to enrol in the Singapore Sports School. A plethora of skills-based courses are also available at various polytechnics and Institutes of Technical Education to equip students with knowledge and skills that will set them in good stead in the workplace.  In this sense, today'seducation landscape in Singapore has made life for young people much more accessible and empowering.\nApart from better education opportunities, young people in Singapore today enjoy higher standards of living compared to the generations that came before them. Rapid urbanisation and modernisation in the last few decades have witnessed attap-roof houses and family farms being replaced with high-rise flats, high-technology buildings and manicured streets lined with trees that are regularly pruned to prevent overgrowth. While communal public toilets, non-air-conditioned buses and potholes on muddy roads form a bulk of the memories of many older generations in Singapore, many Singaporean youth today cannot imagine sleeping without air-conditioning or deprived of the many creature comforts they have now. Many, as such, view the young people today as a mollycoddled bunch who are unable to survive physical hardship and discomfort. In addition to increased standards of living, the increase in spending on luxury and branded items amongst the young in Singapore today lead many to regard this as evidence that youth today have a much easier life as compared to before. Once considered luxury goods only affordable to the rich, expensive smartphones valued at $1,000, high-end electronic gadgets and even branded sneakers valued at $300 are now the norm amongst Singapore youth, thus giving weight to the notion that young people in Singapore today never had it so good.\nHowever, when one takes into account the circumstances and the new set of challenges that our young people have to face, the perspective that young people never had it so good before appears one-dimensional. In the economic sphere, the vicissitudes of what has been termed the \"roller-coaster global economy\" has led to much fear and anxiety over jobs, inflation and economic uncertainty. The oldest millennials born in 1981 would have entered the workforce at a time when the global economy was suffering from an unprecedented collapse of the financial sector, and research by the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis go as far as to suggest that these millennials might be unable to accumulate sufficient wealth for retirement. Younger millennials born in the 1990s and 2000s have to contend with economic uncertainties like the US-China trade war, the implications of climate change on supply chains, and rapid unprecedented rates of technological disruption to traditional industries. This is a vast contrast to the situation in Singapore'searly days of economic development in the 1960s and 1970s which saw the creation of large numbers of jobs in the rapidly growing manufacturing industry, and strong and sustained economic growth rates. Furthermore, with the winds of globalization blowing strong today, competition between economies has intensified, making it imperative for local employees to constantly upgrade themselves to ensure that they can continue to value-add to their companies in order to remain employed. Young people in Singapore today thus face greater pressure to remain competitive and employable, contrary to the perception that they lead smooth-sailing lives with their whole lives charted out for them.\nAdditionally, while young people today are generally more educated than past generations, the overall increase in education standards means that there are greater expectations to do well academically and it is even more difficult for one to stand out amongst a sea of university students, especially when 4 in 10 Singaporean youth will eventually be degree holders. Moreover, the influx of foreign talents in recent years has raised the bar for many graduates, making it more competitive in getting jobs. As a result, young people, despite being given more education opportunities, now face greater difficulty in getting their desired jobs, and often have to make do with jobs that do not match their qualifications or aspirations. A recent research study conducted by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy and the Ong Teng Cheong Labour Leadership Institute suggest a pernicious, worrying underbelly of underemployed millennial graduates, some of whom are earning less than $2,000 a month from their full-time jobs despite their education qualifications. This suggests that young people in Singapore may not necessarily be better off compared to past generations when we take into consideration the increasingly competitive and uncertain job landscape in which they have to survive and thrive in today.\nBesides, the steadily rising costs of living in Singapore is another reason that Singaporeans today may not enjoy an easier life compared to previous generations. Soaring Certificate of Entitlement (COE) for the purchase of motor vehicles and sky-rocketing property prices are but a few of the indicators of inflation. Singapore'sheadline inflation has gradually been on an upward trend, and the cost of purchasing a home or a car in Singapore far exceeds that in other countries. Increasingly, Singaporeans are finding themselves having to tighten their belts to cope with this. Although it is undeniably true that all Singaporeans, both young and old, are affected by the high living costs, young people are more likely to bear the brunt as costs continue to climb, which means they may have to work even harder and longer hours than their parents and grandparents. Today, young people in Singapore take on part-time jobs and freelance gigs such as driving for Grab or Gojek in order to supplement the income from their full-time job, and this presumably complements the observation that millennials in Singapore work 49 hours a week, with 1 out of 4 working two jobs at a time. As a consequence, health issues such as stress, fatigue and even depression could well ensue. In this sense, the higher standards of living that young Singaporeans enjoy today must be viewed in the light of the heavier financial burden imposed by rising living costs.\nIn our world which is increasingly fraught with fear, insecurity and uncertainty, the young are living in a Singapore that is beset with novel challenges that previous generations did not have to grapple with. As the famous historian R G Collingwood once said, \"every new generation must rewrite history in its own way\". In this light, when assessing this or any generation, both the positive and the challenging aspects must be taken into account. Therefore, notwithstanding the better education or job opportunities available to this generation, it would be inaccurate to say that the young in Singapore never had it good if we understand also the myriad issues surrounding today'sgeneration."

                "prompt": "\"GIVEN THE DIFFICULTIES, WE SHOULD STOP TRYING TO SAVE THE ENVIRONMENT.\" WHAT ARE YOUR VIEWS?",
                "text": "Ever since Rachel Carson published her book \"Silent Spring\" in 1962, we have grown increasingly aware of the damage that mankind has been inflicting on the environment. From the first UN environmental conference in Stockholm in 1972 to the 2018 Katowice climate summit, numerous efforts and proposals have been tried and tested, and yet we are constantly told that we are not doing nearly enough. And so the lingering question remains: why has it proven so intractable to save the environment? The answers are complex and multi-faceted, requiring us to examine this issue at both the global and domestic levels and ranging from practical economic arguments to realistic political factors. Yet, difficult as it seems, we should not lose heart in the belief that through sustained and collective effort, we can certainly arrest – if not reverse – the prevailing trend of environmental decline.\nAt the global level, a key impediment to international efforts in saving the environment is the long-standing rift between developed and developing countries over which side should bear the greater responsibility to do so. On one hand, developing nations point to the fact that industrialized countries such as the USA, Britain and France should bear the bulk of the responsibility as they were the ones who contributed significantly to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere for a long period of time during the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. On the other hand, the developed world counter-argues that developing countries such as China, Brazil and India need to bear much responsibility as well because they are the ones currently polluting the environment at a much faster rate due to their rapid industrial development. China, for instance, has overtaken the US as the world'slargest polluter since 2008. While these competing interests of economic development and environmental conservation often come to a head,  the truth is that behind the scenes, both developed and developing countries have long come to realize the shared responsibility in saving the planet. A case in point would be China which is discovering that decades of long neglect and polluting of the environment is beginning to endanger its future economic growth. In light of this, China led the world in 2017 with a $54.4bn investment in clean technology – about 40% higher than third-placed America. It has also implemented a cap-and-trade system which will move China towards achieving its Copenhagen commitment to reduce carbon emissions relative to economic growth by 40-45% below 2005 levels by 2020. Certainly, these measures demonstrate the optimistic trend that the gulf separating countries in this respect is narrowing, which augurs well for the internationalized fight against environmental degradation.\nAnother oft-cited reason for why it has been so difficult to save the environment is the purported trade-off between environmental conservation and economic growth. The argument goes that it is impossible to expect the environment to be protected when many countries require increasing amounts of energy to meet the infinite needs of a growing population and as their economies industrialize. In order to save the environment, it is often claimed that there is a need to phase out economically-efficient but environmentally-unfriendly equipment such as coal-powered plants; to increase the energy efficiency of machines; and to treat harmful industrial waste – all of which would entail higher costs of production and are steps that companies and countries have repeatedly demonstrated that they are loath to undertake. Thankfully, this popular but misleading notion that greater environmental protection can only come about by reduced industrial activity and slower economic growth is steadily being challenged by leading voices in this area. People are beginning to recognize that it is unrealistic and ineffective to expect corporations to act against their vested economic interests, and that economic growth can in actuality complement conservation efforts. The bestselling author Bjorn Lomborg penned a powerful article in Newsweek, in which he persuasively argues that helping people to emerge from poverty and promoting economic growth are among the best things we can do for the environment. He makes the persuasive case that it is only by allowing and facilitating disadvantaged communities and countries to get richer that would enable them to satisfy immediate needs – following which can they then afford to start caring about the environment. The economic history of developed nations such as those on the European continent also suggests that when living standards go up, people and societies can afford to reduce their pollution, stop cutting down forests, and stop dying from dirty air and contaminated water. Even in developing nations, good governance and choice policies are proven to be effective in promoting sustainable economic development. In Indonesia, ex-President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono'sdevelopmental policy was characterised as being \"pro-poor, pro-job creation, pro-growth and pro-environment\". This strategy heralded a period of strong economic growth amounting to 5.9% annually, even as Indonesia'sgreenhouse gas emissions were reduced by 26%. This suggests that technocrats have moved away from believing that economic development and environmental conservation are mutually exclusive. Hopefully, this shift in thinking would gradually remove the bugbear that saving the environment involves huge economic sacrifices, and move us towards implementing policies that are able to accommodate both aspects crucial for our sustainable growth and well-being.\nIn a similar vein, a change in mindsets concerning green technology is also underway which bodes well for the future of environmental preservation. Until recently, much faith has been placed in costly climate-change solutions such as solar panels, biofuels and carbon capture technology. Yet, these examples of green technology have not proven to be the panacea that they are touted to be. As long as wind turbines and solar panels remain more expensive than fossil fuels while working only intermittently, they will never be the solution to our energy woes. As of 2016, Germany, the world'slargest per capita consumer of solar energy, produces just 6.6% percent of its energy. And to achieve this number one status, the country has invested $130 billion in return for $12 billion worth of energy. The net reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the end of the century? Just 23 hours. Similarly, biofuel production is now consuming 40 percent of the US corn harvest, even though it supplies only 4 percent of the transport fuel used in America. Around the world, the turn to biofuel crops is resulting in higher food prices – and hence increased hunger. It is estimated that if the European Union were to derive 10 percent of their transport fuels from biofuels, the price of food could increase astronomically by 76% or deprive an additional 600 million people of food. Indeed, the prevalent belief in green technology to save our earth has proven disappointing and constitutes yet another reason for explaining why it has been so difficult to save the environment. But this should not lead us to despair as there is now a growing consensus that we should divert some of the attention and resources on green initiatives to producing solutions for more obvious and needy problems, which would hopefully generate positive knock-on effects for the environment. World Wide Fund for Nature in Australia, Fiji and New Zealand has introduced blockchain technology to track the migration of tuna, allowing scientific researchers an insight into global fishing, vessel traffic, and the potential effects of overfishing. The World Research Institute has also incorporated an open-source online forest monitoring and alert system which depends on data contribution from users on the ground to investigate forest health and deter illegal logging. Poco a poco, these small steps which are dependent on mass collaboration and effort have had a transformative effect on the way in which we tackle the effect of anthropogenic activities on the environment.\nTurning to the domestic level, a crucial aspect to understanding why it is so difficult to save the environment is local politics, and the lack of political will on a local level. In the United States, the world'ssecond largest emitter of greenhouse gases, politicians often ride into office on a ticket sponsored by large corporations with considerable vested interests. Corporatism is literally entrenched in the American constitution and in its politics. Profit-seeking corporations often hope that the politicians they endorse will implement policies that allow them to make more profits, and politicians are thus beholden to their powerful backers. As such, politicians are unlikely to implement policies that can help the environment but which may hurt businesses, for fear of offending their corporate sponsors and ruining their political careers. For instance, it is well-known that many Washington politicians have links to \"Big Oil\" – influential companies dealing in oil and energy. During his first month in office, President George W. Bush appointed Vice-President Dick Cheney to head a task force charged with developing the country'senergy policy. The group – which conducted its meetings in secret – relied on the recommendations of Big Oil behemoths Exxon Mobil, Shell, BP America and Chevron. It would be the first of many moves to come during the Bush administration that would position oil and gas companies well ahead of other energy interests with billions of dollars in subsidies and tax cuts – payback for an industry with strong ties to the administration and plenty of money to contribute to congressional and presidential campaigns. However, the good news is that in many countries, \"green parties\", which are political parties who campaign on the platform of environmental conservation are slowly but steadily gaining popularity and votes among the electorate who is also becoming more well-informed about environmental issues thanks to greater media attention and coverage. Millennial politicians like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have placed environmental advocacy at the forefront of their political agenda and have proposed drastic measures like the Green New Deal, suggesting a paradigm shift towards greater political will to solve pertinent environmental issues.\nIn the final analysis, while history has shown us that the obstacles to saving our planet are real and formidable, recent changes in mindsets, policies and practices provide us with hope that they are not insurmountable. In time to come, the optimist in me believes that these hurdles can be removed as we work towards a cooperative yet realistic stance on saving our environment both at the international and local levels."

                "prompt": "\"SPORT UNITES MORE THAN IT DIVIDES\". HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE WITH THIS?",
                "text": "Across the globe, sport has been known to be a crucial anchor of most societies. Whether you are in the isolated island nation of Fiji or the landlocked country of Paraguay, sport seems to be a mainstay of everyone'slives. However, despite many viewing sport as a way to bring people together through a common interest, there are those who argue otherwise. These individuals point to times where the platform of sport has been used to push specific agendas and turned into a tool to drive home divisive ideas and disrupt communities instead. Although there are times when individuals can go against the spirit of sport and create greater division and instability in the community , it is undeniable that sport has the uncanny ability to transcend racial and religious boundaries and unite individuals and societies through a shared passion.\nSport unites people by allowing them to see past racial lines through their shared passions and desires. Sport allows individuals from different racial backgrounds but who support the same team to bond over a shared interest and common passion. This encourages them to look past whatever prejudices they may bear towards their counterparts to the extent where it can displace years of disdain and mistrust. This was most notably seen after the events of the 1995 Rugby World Cup in South Africa, where decades of violence, apartheid and mutual distrust which had characterised the relationship between the white Afrikaners and the black indigenous Africans gave way to greater acceptance and understanding as the country united in support of the nation'snational rugby team known as the Springboks. This led to unprecedented levels of dialogue and consensus building between the two racially segregated political factions. The shared desire for the success of their sports team allowed the citizens of South Africa to look past the long-seated hatred between their two racial groups and see each other as human beings by giving them a common interest that the whole country could bond over despite their tumultuous past. Similarly, the Ross Initiative in Sports for Equality is a non-profit organisation which uses sport to empower more than 30,000 students and staff to initiate and discuss America'scomplex racial relations and the concept of inclusivity within their teams. It has successfully managed to promote cohesiveness between players of different races. Thus, sport does have the powerful ability to unify even the most racially divided people, cutting through stereotypes and preconceived notions keeping different racial groups apart and even breaking down barriers of racial tension and allowing these groups to come together as one people through their love of sport.\nSport also has the ability to unite individuals by blurring geographical boundaries and reducing distance and bringing people together based on their love of sport. The international nature of sport makes it an effective channel through which individuals can bond over their common love for sport even to the extent of bringing together individuals from countries with a history of animosity with one another in the spirit of sport. This was witnessed during the 23rd Winter Olympic Games in 2018 where both North and South Koreans marched together at the opening ceremony, and even entered a combined women'sice hockey team to participate at the games. The unification of the two Koreas through sport at the winter games despite their long history of war and tension and their ever-present geographical divide along the 38th parallel, shows the possibility that sport has to tear down walls and bring together people based on the spirit and love of sports. Similarly, tennis doubles players Aisam-Ul-Haq from Pakistan and Rohan Bopanna from India burst onto the world stage in 2010 with their unconventional pairing, and showed the world that sport can help surmount political divides. Cases like this demonstrate the unique place sport holds in the world due to its ability to allow nations to put aside their disagreements and come together for a common interest, further emphasising why sports unites to a much greater extent than it divides.\nSport also has the potential to unite people in times of extreme chaos and violence. Even in the most tumultuous of circumstances, sport gives people from all sides a respite from the endless conflict and violence and allows combatants to see each other once again as human beings instead of merely enemies. This was most notably witnessed during the Christmas ceasefire of 1914 during World War One between British and German troops who laid down their weapons and came together for a game of football on the battlefield. This unexpected show of unity between men who at that point had been trying to kill each other for months is a clear example of the power of sport to bring communities together and give even the most hated of enemies a means of escape from the cycle of hatred that pervaded those times. In fact, the Olympic Truce can trace its origins to the 9th century, where Iphitos convinced other rulers to end any conflict for a week before and after the Olympic games in the spirit of sportsmanship and universal peace. The amazing unifying ability of sport to allow individuals to cast aside their differences and come together in the spirit of the games amplify the unique place sports occupy as an instrument for unification that is strong enough to bring people together even during the most divisive times in human history.\nHowever, when passion for sport is taken too far, it can lead to an excessive and unhealthy rivalry amongst athletes and their fans which could have a divisive effect on the community instead. When passion is taken to extremes and transforms into unwarranted hatred and violence amongst rival fans and players, this can lead to an incredibly divisive and unstable atmosphere that could lead to hostility and even violence. This was unfortunately seen during the 2016 European Championships in France where rival fans took their sporting rivalries too far and engaged in violent brawls with opposing fans throughout the tournament leading to many being thrown behind bars and even more ending up in hospitals due to the mass violence and chaos that these confrontations caused. Instead of being a time for fans to come together over the spectacle that was supposed to be Euro 2016, the hyper-intensified passions and rivalries of these fans caused the tournament to be marred by violence and resulted in divisive sentiments amongst the different countries and their supporters, who pushed the blame to one another for the outbreak of the violence. Thus, when taken to excess, passion and rivalry in sport can transform into mass hysteria and violence, leading to the division of sporting communities as they begin to clash over their loyalties and overzealously express their support through violence.\nFurthermore, when sport is exploited to push political agendas, it can be used as a tool to create divisive sentiments, which goes against the true spirit of sportsmanship. Despite many believing that sport and politics should remain at arm'slength from each other, political agendas and sentiment often creep into sport as governments sometimes see it as one of the easiest and most publicly visible avenues to drive ideas and agendas, some of which are detrimental to harmony. One example of this exploitation of sport can be seen through the recent denial of visas for two Pakistani shooters to enter India to participate in the shooting World Cup. This was attributed to India'sbelief that Pakistan has not done enough to tackle the violent militias hiding within its borders. This fuels the international and domestic narratives that India is trying to champion, which is that Pakistan is a terror state and that it should not be trusted. This blatant use of sport as a political tool disregards the rights of athletes to free and fair competition. It also uses sport to push political agendas in a highly visible public setting, leading to the rise of division as these actions are debated and even championed by some in the public. When governing bodies go against the spirit of sport and use it for their own political gain, it can lead to greater divisions in society as the use of such a publicly visible medium often riles up support for these actions and in turn causes people to see these divisive acts as justifiable and necessary.\nUltimately, sport on its own is designed to unite communities through the shared values and interests associated with sport. Sport allows individuals to grow and learn together, giving people an avenue to interact while leaving all preconceived notions and animosities at the door, allowing them to see past their differences and bond as human beings with the same shared interests. However, if the competitive nature of sport is taken too far without restraint, or if sport is used as a means to a political end in particular, we detract from the inclusive nature of sport, and inadvertently promote divisive violence and animosity throughout society. Thus, despite the fact that sport does unite much more than it divides, if left unchecked and allowed to continuously be exploited, sport could become one of the greatest tools to divide communities around the world."

                "prompt": "IS THE PROTECTION OF PRIVACY WORTHWHILE?",
                "text": "Individual privacy has been at the forefront of debates for years with many across the globe constantly weighing the need for privacy against the need for governments to monitor what people are doing in order to prevent events of mass terror. With the rise in terror attacks in the past five years in particular, this discussion has become more critical than ever. The question that needs to be addressed is whether the protection of privacy and thus people'srights to not have their lives monitored is worth the risks of allowing terrorism, violence and crime to continue to grow, and my view is that the protection of privacy is worthwhile to the extent that it does not impinge on the need for governments to protect the safety and welfare of their people.\nThe protection of privacy is worthwhile as a matter of principle, since it is the only thing that stands between an individual'sfreedom of expression and living in a lifeless dystopian state. The protection of privacy is inextricably tied up with the protection of individual freedom, with the loss of privacy effectively meaning the loss of people'srights to their lives, since every decision, choice and action taken from that point onwards would be monitored by the state. This effectively takes away people'sfreedom to choose as every decision must be held to the standards of the law and the people monitoring them, creating an environment where people will never be free to act and behave like themselves. Examples of this sad reality have been described throughout popular culture although with added dramatization such as the dreary depiction of life in George Orwell'srenowned novel \"1984\" and the movie based on the novel which depicts the dark dystopian future that could await people if they choose to forgo their right to privacy. By giving states control over individual'sprivacy, we open the door for states to go further and demand the ability to control where individuals can go and control the skills and knowledge that everyone is allowed to learn. The trickle effects of relinquishing the right to privacy can be seen through dictatorial states such as North Korea where every aspect of everyone'slives are controlled by the state: from the education system and what is taught to the state media and even the food that are available to most people to eat.  We also see this in the People'sRepublic of China, where the social credit system, initially meant to address the issue of ungraciousness and crime, has become a tool of mass surveillance and therefore of control. These are prime examples of what could follow should privacy be allowed to be taken away in the name of protection as governments and states might eventually be unsatisfied with just being able to monitor for potential threats, and would instead want the ability to prevent future threats from happening, something which can ultimately only be achieved by complete control of its populace in order to weed out criminal and radical ideological thinking. Thus, the protection of individual privacy is important as it would prevent the descent of democracies into police states as it would be the beginning of individual rights being sacrificed in order to address the issues of crime and terrorism, especially if the only way to do so is to completely control every aspect of people'slives.\nWhy are individual freedoms desirable, then, or even worth protecting from the all-seeing eye of Big Brother? I venture to argue that individual freedoms, including the right to privacy and non-scrutiny, form the basis of happiness, which is presumably the ultimate goal of society. Even if individual freedoms are not explicitly curtailed by despotic regimes, but instead indirectly curtailed by sympathetic and paternalistic governments, this too might affect the happiness of individuals who otherwise might be able to live life in accordance with their own wishes. Contemporary philosopher Michel Foucault goes one step further in suggesting that the lack of privacy is directly connected to the loss of freedom and thus the loss of happiness through the concept of panopticism. Foucault suggests that external surveillance and the intrusion of privacy associated with this surveillance is ultimately internalised, and each person becomes his or her own guard. This greatly reduces people'sfreedom of expression, and the happiness associated with that freedom of living according to their own wishes.  A study published by the Applied Research in Quality of Life suggests that an increase in freedoms correlates with an increase in happiness. This understanding and desire presumably underpin historical struggles for freedom, from the \"Baltic Way\", where more than two million people formed a human chain across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania to protest the despotism of the Soviet Union, to the French Revolution, and to how \"Wallace fought for Scotland, left the name of Wallace to be found, like a wild flower, all over his dear country\". This suggests that individual freedoms are worth fighting for, and as established earlier, the erosion of the right to privacy ultimately cumulates into the erosion of individual freedoms, and should thus be decried. The right to have a life that is private and non privy to the prying eyes of the state is thus essential despite the risks it entails as without privacy, individuals will not be able to live their lives the way the want and express their true selves, effectively destroying the uniqueness and imaginative joy that makes life worth living.\nHowever, with the rising threat of crime and violence, the protection of privacy might not be as worthwhile as the need to protect people from acts of mass terror and violence may outweigh this. The ability to monitor individuals would allow states to better address the issues of rising crime and terror by giving them an avenue to better track individuals with a greater risk of being involved in criminal activities. States will also be able to set up alert systems to highlight any actions by individuals that could possibly lead to potentially damaging terrorist or criminal activity such as the planning of crimes of terror attacks by people within their borders. Allowing governments access to sensitive information would have allowed law enforcement agencies to prevent many of the attacks perpetrated by radicals and criminals such as the shooting at a mosque in Christchurch in March 2019 and the multiple school shootings that have taken place in America over the years. In fact, concerns about privacy have actively impeded pre-emptive measures and investigations. Former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief James Comey argued that encrypted messaging platforms, meant to safeguard the privacy of individual users, deprive governments and intelligence agencies of crucial information, \"giving terrorists a tremendous advantage against us\". Letting go of the desire for privacy might be the necessary sacrifice that will allow governments to finally get a step ahead of these criminals and extremists as the individualised nature of international terrorism and crime today makes it harder and harder for defence agencies to track and protect us against these threats, which could come from anywhere, even from the people living right next door. Relinquishing the right to privacy might be the only way to allow states to properly address the ever changing and complex network of international crime and terror, and protect us from the many different threats that are brewing just under the surface of society.\nThe protection of privacy is furthermore not worthwhile, as it may prevent people and states from taking responsibility for the actions and being held accountable. While privacy is largely individual, it also extends to states when they are being scrutinised by other nations. Allowing both states and individuals to hide behind the shield of privacy allows people of power to basically go about doing whatever they please without fear of condemnation, if they have significant enough means to keep news of their actions contained. For example, countries such as China have long been using the argument of privacy and national sovereignty to prevent the international community from properly investigating accusations of human rights violations against Chinese Muslims in Xinjiang that have been made against them. The country has used its power in the international community and political red tape to assert that what happens within the country is a private Chinese matter that the international community has no business in. Examples such as this illustrate how the idea of privacy can be used in order to prevent entities from being held accountable for their actions, instead hiding behind privacy as a means of burying and news about their actions. Thus, the protection of privacy is not worthwhile when privacy is just used as a tool to conceal the actions of people and states from the outside world in order to shield themselves from having to deal with the eventual repercussions of these actions, and continue to carry out these atrocities without fear of condemnation due to the protection that privacy give them.\nOverall, whether the protection of privacy is worthwhile depends heavily on the degree that our privacy would be taken away should we choose to stop defending it. Although the relaxing of privacy could have beneficial impacts to society by stopping people and countries from using it as a shield and be held accountable for their actions, and lead to states being more prepared and capable to address the threats that terrorism and crime have towards their communities, the complete relinquishment of privacy might in the long run lead to the loss of all individual freedoms and cause the countries of the world to descend into dystopian police states of our own making."

                "prompt": "\"DIVERSITY BROUGHT ABOUT BY GLOBALIZATION SHOULD BE CELEBRATED, NOT FEARED.\" DISCUSS.",
                "text": "The world today is more diverse than it has ever been. The advent of globalisation, increasing ease of communication and movement has allowed many different cultures, languages, traditions and beliefs to permeate the world, no longer completely separated by geographical boundaries. This increased diversity has led to many positive effects on the world at large such as greater international cooperation, greater economic growth and improvements to the overall standards of healthcare as the exchange of information becomes more fluid. Yet, despite the positivity associated with diversity, there are those who believe that our trust and focus in creating a more diverse international community has led to countries neglecting the needs of their local people. Although these fears do have some truth in them, the benefits that increased diversity has brought to the world are undeniable and cannot be overlooked, and should therefore be more celebrated than feared.\nAcross the world, the pioneering of new communication technologies has allowed us to become more aware of the extent of diversity across the globe, and this should be celebrated as it has led to greater cooperation within the international community. The Internet has made it easier for individuals to learn languages on their own, and this has in particular led to greater ease of communication between regular individuals and even political leaders, allowing them to communicate with each other in a more relaxed and friendly atmosphere while also ensuring that parties can get their points across without the fear of miscommunication. This is evident through the rise of English as a universal language over the past 10 years, with a Washington Post article in 2015 marking the number of countries which English is spoken in at 101, making it the most popular language in the world. The popularity of English even in countries where the language is not the native tongue has allowed not only business and politics to be carried out with greater ease, it has also allowed the average individual to make interpersonal connections with each other from across the globe. Linguistic diversity, and the willingness to accept and adapt to this diversity, has thus allowed languages to spread all over the globe, having a positive impact on the way people around the planet communicate and brought us all closer together, benefiting our political relations, economy and general way of life. In a way, diversity begets even more diversity, enriching the daily lives and experiences of individuals.\nDiversity should also be celebrated due to the positive effect it has on the global economy. The rise of globalisation in the early 2000s allowed many industries to in fact grow and learn from their compatriots overseas, by allowing companies to venture beyond their own shores. Countries such as Singapore are gleaming examples of the benefits of diversity in the workplace as greater diversity has allowed people in the workforce to learn from one another and improve their methods of trade and production. This understanding underpinned Singapore'simmigration policies, which were concretized as Singapore sought to transit from manufacturing to high-tech and value-added activities in the 1980s. Similarly, the spread of German engineering methods and Arabian textile production methods have allowed these practises to be replicated to varying degrees across the world, improving the overall quality and efficiency in these industries. A more historical example would be the development of Europe and the United States of America during the Industrial Revolution. Researchers from Brown University have suggested that the \"openness to other cultures\", measured in terms of geographical isolation, were key to the transfer of technological skills rooted in certain cultures, underpinning rapid economic development. The improved quality of products and the improved monetary benefits that have come as a result of cultural exchange signifies the positive benefits that diversity in the workforce has brought upon the global economy as knowledge of better and more efficient methods of work in countless different industries can be shared and collectively improved on by people with different expertise from different parts of the world in order to grow the global economy.\nThe benefits of diversity should also be celebrated when you consider the positive effects that diversity has had on the healthcare and wellness industry across the world. Increased diversity in the healthcare and wellness industry has led to the rapid spread of many new and unique methods of treating illnesses, and introduced a vast array of health foods to the masses which have never been heard of before. Increased diversity in the healthcare industry specifically has allowed doctors to learn and study diseases which are mostly geographically contained such as monkeypox in Africa and attempt to treat them with Western or Eastern styles of medicine and treatment in order to address the problem in the countries that it is affecting, as well as prevent it from spreading to individuals in other parts of the world. Nobel laureate Tu Youyou drew inspiration from Traditional Chinese Medicine and alternative medicine, widely decried as \"pseudo-science\" in the West, in order to discover artemisinin, a useful chemical component in the fight against malaria. Similarly, the spread of health foods such as the Acai berry in the past few years was brought from relative obscurity to fame by those from South America, more specifically Brazil, where it has been a popular health snack for a long time. Diversity in the healthcare and wellness industry has allowed the world to become better prepared and healthier by improving not only what we eat but also the ways we tackle illnesses and diseases through the sharing of different cultures\" knowledge and resources, improving the overall quality of life around the globe. It has allowed us to celebrate a time of unprecedented advancement in our healthcare systems and practices and drastically improved our quality of life in ways which would have been simply unimaginable otherwise.\nHowever, despite its benefit to the global economy, greater diversity can undermine the economic wellbeing of individuals within countries. Greater diversity in the economy often leads to countries and corporations valuing specialist and cheap foreign talent more than the talent within their borders. This can be seen in places such as Hong Kong, where the expatriate population is around four percent of the entire population of Hong Kong, creating a higher level of competition in the workforce for the local population than they had previously experienced. This is also seen in Singapore, which depends predominantly on foreign workers to meet its manpower needs in the construction, retail and food and beverage industries. With countries more willing to look at a diverse array of cultures for talent, locals in these countries and cities have begun to feel increased levels of competition throughout all levels of  the workforce as only the best and brightest can compete with the foreign experts at the top of their fields for jobs, while the competition for lower income jobs rises due to the increased number of individuals flooding to more developed economies to look for job opportunities. This struggle for employment however, has a greater effect on the poorer sections of the population as they may lack the skills to adapt and improve their skills to stay competitive, leading to the eventual rise in the income gap as the inflow of cheaper foreign talent for menial jobs causes greater problems for the poor than the introduction of foreign expats to the economy as these industry professionals have the means and ability to adapt and maintain their competitiveness in the job market. These fears underpin the rise of populist governments like that led by Donald J. Trump in the United States and right-wing governments across Europe, which capitalise on the concerns of the working class that they would be displaced. Thus, the benefits associated with a more diverse workforce, such as lower cost of labour and increasing quality of work,  should not be taken at face value especially since these measures implemented without proper regulations in place may lead to the widening of the income gap and other dire consequences for the country such as social instability.\nIncreased diversity and ease of movement could also make it harder for countries to develop due to the brain drain phenomenon, where talent in developing nations are more willing to venture overseas due to the diverse nature of the workforce in most first world countries. Local talent in developing nations will start looking to work overseas rather than staying locally as it would give them the opportunity to work in better environments and with better benefits due to the structural foundations that have already been laid overseas as opposed to in their homes. Furthermore, the diverse nature of local workforces also encourages them to move abroad as they feel more comfortable to peruse overseas opportunities with less of a fear of falling homesick. This has been happening for years in countries such as India where most of its top scientists and engineers move to developed nations such as America in pursuit of work, draining the country of a large number of its top intellectuals who could have been working in the country to help it progress. Out of 2.96 million foreign-born scientists based in Asia, Indian nationals number about 950,000, suggesting the extent of brain drain that India has to contend with. Uganda, too, has recently plunged into a healthcare crisis as more than 2000 highly trained medical professionals have chosen to leave for greener pastures in the Middle East. The loss of these top intellectuals to foreign governments and companies sets back developing nations by taking away the people that would have been their pioneers and leaders which would lead the country to a new dawn in terms of technological and economic growth, preventing these developing nations from steadily growing and improving into first world developed nations themselves. Thus, diversity, despite its benefit to the global economy, has left many countries without the means of developing as their top talents are more willing to leave the countries for greener pastures due to the increased job security and comfort that the acceptance of diversity has created for foreigners in the global economy.\nOverall, diversity has with it both positive and negative effects on the world as a whole. However, it is undeniable that with diversity, some will continue to fear it and the influence it has on the world. Despite this, with proper regulations to mitigate the negative effects that diversity brings with it, the benefits that diversity has on international cooperation, the global economy and healthcare and wellness alone should be enough to convince the world that it is something that should be celebrated and not feared."

                "prompt": "HOW FAR DO YOU AGREE THAT AS YOUR SOCIETY PROGRESSES, THERE IS NO PLACE FOR HERITAGE?",
                "text": "Over the years, society has undergone countless changes at a dizzying speed making it unrecognisable from how the world looked like just 20 years ago. With the advent of technological advancements, many have lauded the growth and improvements that society has experienced during this time of progress. However, many also worry about the place that heritage and tradition have in society as the world continues to progress. The fear is that as the world progresses, there will be no place for heritage and traditions in the modern world, leading to their eventual demise in favour of progress. This pessimistic outlook, however, may not hold true as the continued progress of society does not have to mean that our heritages would be lost forever. In fact, it could herald a new age in which heritage and traditions regain their preponderant role in society.\nThe progress of society has in fact allowed for the increasing preservation of heritage and traditions in society. The leaps that society has made in technology and research have allowed traditions and historical events to be better analysed and documented than ever before. They have allowed us to sift through hundreds of years of heritage and digitise historical records. This ensures that information deemed crucial to the heritage of diverse cultures across the world is safely and securely stored, and that these cultures continue to thrive in the modern world. In 2018, one of the world'sbiggest museums, the Smithsonian, announced that it will be embarking on a grand project to digitise much of its existing collection of artefacts and fossils, making them more accessible to academics and the general public. This endeavour not only allows for a more comprehensive catalogue of artefacts to be recorded, but also ensures that the history and heritage of these artefacts are protected should anything happen to the physical artefacts themselves. Somali Architecture uses archival research and 3D modelling to replicate and preserve buildings from pre-war Mogadishu and which were destroyed during the Somalian civil war. The Digital Giza Project is another such example: by digitising over 40 years of archaeological discoveries online and displaying them through 3D models, it has allowed anyone around the world – academic or not – to experience the amazing heritage that the history of Egypt has to offer through the use of modern technology. The digitising of all these pieces of history allows society to ensure that our heritages are maintained as even if events such as the one that brought down the great Library of Alexandria and destroyed all its historical record and artefacts were to happen, the heritage of its collection would live on in the digital world. Thus, the world'sprogress has created new avenues for us to ensure the preservation of our heritage and traditions by making it easier to protect the artefacts and knowledge that give life to our heritage, highlighting how technological advancement and heritage can indeed exist harmoniously within modern society.\nThe progress made in society has also led to rise in awareness of the heritage that different groups across the world hold dear. With the world now feeling smaller than it ever has before due to the prominence of social media and the Internet, cultural knowledge and traditions from all over the world, across space and time, are at our fingertips. The online community has given new life to traditional practices and stories by curating and presenting them to people all across the world through digital platforms, raising the overall profile of the heritage of different communities and lifting them out of obscurity. The increase in knowledge about New Zealand'sMaori community for instance has increased global awareness of the heritage of New Zealand, as traditional Maori practises such as the Haka are performed during sporting events on television screens around the world. Platforms like Google Arts and Culture similarly allow the public to access high-resolution images of artworks housed in famous museums across the world. The progress that has been made with technology has thus allowed communities around the world to practise their traditions in front of a wider audience, raising the awareness of the different heritages and traditions that exist around the world, ensuring that these practises, traditions and knowledge that make up a community'sheritage continue to live and thrive for years to come. With the world continuing to progress, it has in fact created a more conducive and comfortable environment for its different heritages to grow and prosper by giving these heritages a new voice through the avenue of technology and social media.\nThe progress of society has also led to different communities across the world becoming more accepting of different groups and their cultural heritage. The progress that society has made towards the acceptance of different cultures has allowed them to thrive even beyond their original borders. Increased education and the message of acceptance that has been spread across the world as a result of globalisation and the ease of exchange of information and movement has witnessed cultures and heritage thrive in completely foreign lands as many of these heritages and traditions are brought along with their people as they move across the increasingly connected world. One prime example of this would be the rise of Chinatowns within major cities across the world, acting as a shining beacon of Chinese cultural heritage amidst a cosmopolitan backdrop in cities like Melbourne, New York and London – miles away from China itself. Indian food joints have similarly become ubiquitous in Western cities like London. Apart from being a place for people to maintain their cultural heritage abroad, these areas have become a way for foreigners to acquaint themselves with the cultural heritage of a place and community within the comforts of their own country. The prominence of different cultural experiences and images across the world has thus created a more inclusive and accepting world, creating a more comfortable and inviting environment for people to express and maintain their cultural heritage.\nHowever, there are often times when the preservation of heritage conflicts with and obstructs progress, preventing communities from improving due to their loyalty to heritage. The road to progress can often be destructive, with people having to sacrifice in order to advance. Oftentimes, progress can only be achieved if we are willing to give up our traditions and heritage as the resources that are important to these traditions are needed for the future. This struggle between heritage and progress can be seen in Singapore as the country continues to struggle with the issue of land scarcity while attempting to maintain the heritage of the country through the preservation of small, old buildings such as shophouses, which if allowed to be torn down to make way for new developments, could go a long way to solving the land scarcity issue. European cities like Prague, Krakow and Budapest often struggle to incorporate future urban development while preserving historical architecture, resulting in intricate and complex urban planning patterns centred around relics of the past. The nostalgia that many communities feel towards places and objects of their heritage can often cloud their judgement when it comes to the bigger goal of the community as they are unwilling to sacrifice their heritage to solve their modern problems. Thus, heritage often comes into direct conflict with progress as the only way to allow the world to continue to progress is sometimes to let go of our heritage and let progress take its place.\nOverall, as society progresses, so does the way heritage is viewed and manged by those in society. Progress has allowed heritage and traditions to enter a period of renaissance where they are more readily visible and accepted than ever before. Although heritage often does come into conflict with progress in certain areas, the progress that society has made has created avenues to work around these inconveniences and allowed the heritage of different societies across the world to become more global and more secure. Many would assume that as society progresses, there will be no place left for heritage in society, however, the opposite is in fact true: as society progresses ,it creates more opportunities for heritage to be preserved, spread and accepted in our modern and progressive community."

                "prompt": "TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU AGREE THAT SCIENCE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN RELIGION?",
                "text": "For centuries, it appears that science and religion have always been at loggerheads with one another, with many believing that it is impossible to believe wholeheartedly in both simultaneously due to their inherent differences. Whenever these two are discussed together, the question of importance is always brought up as scientists and theologians constantly argue over whether science or religion is more important to the world. While many claim that it is clear that science has the edge in this debate due to the sheer amount of evidence that proves that the sciences have a tangible impact on the planet and humankind at large, the influence of religion on the world cannot be understated as it is undeniable that it holds significant power and purpose in people'slives.\nScience is seen to be more important than religion in terms of its contributions to the overall health of society. Advancements in biomedical sciences and technology have dramatically increased the lifespans of the human race by almost double of our ancestors, with cures and treatments for illnesses long thought to be deadly being available in local drug stores all across the world. For example, the discovery of penicillin in 1928 allowed doctors to finally be able to treat illnesses and infections that for centuries had been taking the lives of many. Globally, the advent of science and modern healthcare has caused a 90% decline in the infant mortality rate from 1915 to 1997, and a 99% decline in the maternal mortality rate in the same period. Scientific research and discoveries have changed the way healthcare and health in general is perceived, completely revolutionising the way we live our lives and what we believe the be possible. In contrast, it seems that religion has merely given people a way of dealing with the emotional toll that chronic illnesses can have on them, rather than providing any definitive treatment that could help to actually solve or cure illnesses. Despite its important role in allowing individuals to better deal with their experiences when it comes to illnesses and infections, these benefits are merely emotional as opposed to the definitive, tangible benefits that scientific progress has had in terms of the development of drugs and treatments to directly tackle these illnesses and ultimately cure individuals. Further, religious views may directly undermine the health and wellbeing of individuals where Jehovah Witnesses for instance reject blood transfusions \"not only in obedience of God but also out of respect to him as the Giver of life\". Those who do not adhere to this doctrine risk excommunication from the community, and often have to choose between their physical wellbeing and their social interests. As such, this demonstrates the elevated importance that science has as opposed to religion in terms of promoting and maintaining physical health.\nIt can be argued that science is also more important than religion in terms of its prominence in the modern world. Technology in particular has become one of the mainstays in modern living with many extensively relying on devices in order to manage every aspect of their lives. Science and technology have transfigured and revolutionized the way we commute, the way we interact with one another, the way we do business and even the things we consume, with plant-based alternatives and lab developed meats being introduced in order to deal with the rising levels of meat consumption. Technologies ranging from cell phones to laser medicine are ubiquitous; the presence of scientific developments at every corner illustrates the prominence and even the dependence that the modern world has on science. In contrast, despite its long history and the influence it has had on society, even at times influencing the ideas and decisions of the people, religion and religious activities have largely taken a backseat to science in this day and age. Across the world, young people are growing less religious – a study conducted by the Pew Research Centre indicates that in 41 out of 106 countries surveyed, young adults are increasingly less likely to be affiliated to religious groups. Religions across the world have largely been relegated to performing ceremonial roles on special occasions, as opposed to how science and technology have basically been able to capture global focus and attention. Although many people draw meaning and inspiration from religion in order to make decisions or take specific actions, science gives them the means to actually carry out their objectives and achieve their goals, demonstrating the dependence that even religion itself has developed for science. Thus, the inescapable nature of the influence of science on modern life demonstrates how religion has taken a backseat in terms of importance as compared to science. Unlike religion, science and scientific innovations permeate every aspect of our lives as the world is dependent on scientific exploits to a scarily suffocating degree.\nAdditionally, science holds greater importance as compared to religion in terms of how it shapes our perception and understanding of the physical world around us and the way forward. Countries across the world have agreed that an understanding of science is necessary in order to understand how things in the world work and the overall nature of the physical world itself. This can be seen through the prominence of science in education systems around the world, instilling in the society the reasons behind many of the phenomenon that we witness during our lives. Former US President Barack Obama notably pledged more than $240 million in schemes to promote the role of scientific study in an average American student'seducation. Science has allowed society to fully grasp the natural world and understand things such as the water cycle, vegetation, gravity often to the detriment of religion as religious beliefs become undermined by scientific understanding. This greater grasp of the world around us has allowed us to innovate and improve, no longer fearing natural disasters such as earthquakes and tsunamis as the wrath of god and instead understanding why these events happen and developing ways to predict them and protect ourselves from them. That said, religion can at times reinforce and even lay the basis for us to better understand the natural world. Religious texts and their description of events are of great help to scientists hypothesising and corroborating theories about the world, such as how the theory about the Big Bang, a theory about how the universe came into existence, existed in some form within Christian religious texts for centuries. Nonetheless, the importance of the sciences to the progress of the human race is unquestionable: an understanding of the world through science is essential in allowing us to continue to grow and innovate for the future and not get held back by the artificial limitations imposed by religion.\nHowever, when we examine this debate from a different angle, it cannot be denied that religion is more important than science from a moral perspective as religion lays many of the moral foundations which govern the way human beings act. Much of what people understand as right and wrong has developed over the years due to religious influences, with many societies directly classifying actions as good or bad due to how their gods or their sacred scriptures would view these acts. For example, it is widely known that in many religions that act of murder is a sin and the Christian Bible even goes so far as to tell its followers to \"love thy neighbour as thyself\", demonstrating how religion often holds people to a higher moral code and reinforcing that notions of right and wrong come naturally to most. Legal traditions, which often draw inspiration from conventional moral standards, have been influenced by religion at some point or the other. In Thailand, Buddhist concepts of cosmic law and religion have been flawlessly integrated with modern concepts of public administration and legal process, introducing a framework for both religious discourse and legal authority. That said, it should be noted that religion may not be perfect in this aspect – religion is often used to justify acts of bigotry such as homophobia, as the Westboro Baptist Church suggests. Despite its flaws, religion does serve as a guide in many ways to how people should act, as all religions do tend to promote good behaviour and practises and reinforce strong moral character. Science on the other hand intrinsically lacks emotion and any moral compass as science is in essence entirely based on facts and outcomes. While religion alone does not make up the moral code of all humans, it does however form the moral foundations that many in the world choose to adhere to, demonstrating its important place in maintaining the moral compass of many across the world, and indeed even for those who have dedicated their lives to science.\nReligion is also more important and effective than science when it comes to bringing people together and forming bonds within the community. Religion gives people a common belief system that unites people, allowing people to come together to share their struggles and beliefs within their common faiths. Religion often forms the basis of many communities being one of the only things that can bring together people from different walks of life and even different parts of the world together, uniting people in a way that not much else can. The Hajj in the Islamic faith for example is an annual pilgrimage to Mecca in Saudi Arabia, the holiest site in the world for Muslims and a mandatory religious duty that gathers Muslims from around the world to worship and practise their religion. On a smaller scale, communities anchored by churches tend to rally when one of their own is in need of aid, and this is evidenced by church-run programmes like soup kitchens or donation drives. Research conducted by the Religion News Service suggests that religious people are three to four times more likely than non-religious people to engage in civic activism, be it volunteering their time with grassroot organisations, donating to social causes or engaging with their community. This uniting of people from a vast array of different countries and backgrounds based on their common beliefs and faith, demonstrates the unifying ability that religion can have on individuals as it allows them to bond and see pass their differences because of their common faith. Despite science being something that is used by all humans, the scientific method emphasises the use of logic and objectivity, and therefore its proponents may lack any spiritual connection due to its cold and clinical nature. It can be summarised as a discipline that is used by all but only understood by an advanced few due to the complex nature of science. Furthermore, although science has allowed people across the globe to interact more and understand each other'scultures through technology, much of these interactions and understandings happen at face value and do not evoke the same strength of community which is achieved through the spiritual connections that religion creates. Moreover, technology provides a means of increasing social isolation instead. The Stanford University for the Quantitative Study of Society noted a correlation between spending a significant amount of time on the Internet and people spending less time interacting with their families. Thus, the importance of religion in uniting people is unrivalled, with the efforts of science and scientific advancements paling in comparison to those of religion due to the emotional and spiritual nature of religion, allowing it to bring people together for a higher power and something greater than themselves.\nOverall, science holds a predominant role in underpinning our understanding of the physical world, with the majority of the tools we use to work, commute, and survive being a direct result of scientific innovations. However, religion is unique and unrivalled in its contribution to society'smoral, emotional and spiritual development through its ability to hold individuals to a higher moral standing and bind them through their religious beliefs in a way that nothing else can. Thus, while science is more important in terms of directly leading to the scientifically and technologically efficient world we have today, without religion, the world would lack unity and meaning, creating a society that is unable to tell from right and wrong and unable to create and innovate for the good and progress of humanity."

                "prompt": "IS CHANGE ALWAYS GOOD?",
                "text": "Some people love change, while others will do anything in their power to avoid it. However, most agree that change is a huge and necessary part of life. Those who advocate for change believe that change is always good as it allows the world to constantly improve and move towards a better future. However, many believe that it is not that simple, as such an absolute view of change ignores the fact that the effects that change has on the world and the lives of its people are extremely complex. To classify change therefore as solely good or bad would be inaccurate, as it would characterise the nature of change to an absolute degree, something that the complex nature of change just does not allow. Hence, I would argue that while change is largely positive, there are certain downsides and risks we have to be aware of, and hence, it cannot be always good.\nIt is often argued that change is good as it leads to innovation and improvements in life. The desire to constantly improve and the willingness to embrace change in order to achieve better and to adapt to changes in the external environment have resulted in a proliferation of innovations and inventions, allowing society to come a long way in terms of technology and quality of life. The willingness to change has prompted the invention of many of the things which we deem as ubiquitous today such as aeroplanes, the Internet and personal computers. The Wright brothers, for instance, saw the need to improve transportation networks and eventually invented a flying craft that could be controlled while in the air, demonstrating how change can be a positive experience for society as the willingness to change and the desire to improve can lead to innovations that drastically improve the way we live our lives. More recently, researchers at Maastricht University in the Netherlands have reacted to anthropogenic climate change by introducing lab-grown meat on a larger scale. Evidently, change is good in that it provokes improvements and encourages greater uptake of that new solution, thus allowing people to improve and innovate. This has allowed society to continuously improve for the better instead of remaining stagnant.\nChange is also good when it allows people to become more accepting of new and unconventional ideas. Oftentimes, ideas and traditions are relics of the past, rooted in backward ways of thinking and may not have a place in our world today. With technological progress and increasing diversity, newer ideas and beliefs have begun to permeate society, forcing many to rethink beliefs that have long been present in society. This change in the mindset of many within society has led to the world becoming more accepting not only of different cultures but also of people with ideas and beliefs that do not align with the status quo. In turn, this creates a more tolerant and accepting environment for people to coexist despite their differences. This is in stark contrast to the past where people were segregated based on the colour of the skin or their sexual orientation in places such as America where having coloured and non-coloured designations on busses, restaurants and even restrooms was a common sight. The world has taken great strides in this aspect, with the legalisation of gay marriage in the United States and in Taiwan, and the decriminalisation of homosexuality in conservative India, among others. In Singapore'scontext, marital immunity for rape has been repealed since 2019, and widely decried as Singaporeans become more aware of the prevalence of sexual assault in domestic situations. These events – which many would have thought to be impossible years ago – are a testament to the power that change and the willingness to change can have on the nature of society. Evidently, change can be a force for good when it allows people to forgo stereotypes and outdated ways of thinking and encourages people to become more willing to accept different ideas by changing their own views on how society should be. In a world that is increasingly diverse and complex, change has the potential to create a more harmonious, tolerant and peaceful world.\nHowever, the effects of change are not solely good or bad, as the pursuit of change can be destructive and outweigh the eventual positive outcomes that change brings about. Many times, in the pursuit of change and improvement, unintended negative consequences do arise. As society strives to enhance its technological prowess and overall standard of living, the changes that have been made to the way of life on the planet has resulted in the creation of modern problems. Anthropogenic climate change, for instance, is a direct result of the Industrial Revolution, which saw the proliferation of technologies such as the coal-dependent steam engine as humans sought to improve their quality of life. The changes that have occurred in the way that trade, transport and business are conducted have led to consequences such as the increase in air travel and the food we consume. These in turn have led to tremendous amounts of burning and deforestation in order to keep up with the need for energy. As a result, the amount of greenhouse gases has increased tremendously over the past 150 years, and close to 1.3 million square metres of forest cover have been destroyed since 1990. The blind pursuit of change and innovation, motivated by our obsession with improvement of quality of life, has led the human race to a time where the very existence of the entire human race is now under threat. It is often quipped that \"the road to hell is often paved with good intentions\", and indeed, while many desire change with altruistic motivations in mind, we must be mindful that these good intentions can and do sometimes lead to detrimental consequences for society in the long term.\nFurthermore, change can be detrimental if communities are unable to adapt to these changes, or if the effects of these changes are not appropriately managed. Many communities around the world have deep-rooted traditions steeped in history. Some of these traditions have directed the way these communities live their lives, with many being traditionally subsistence-based in nature. The focus on subsistence has caused many of these native and traditional communities to be unable to adapt to the changes that the world has undergone over the years, as they lack the education and the capital to entirely rework the nature of their societies and align it to the way that the modern world is structured. The Native American communities for example have struggled for years in the United States as their traditional subsistence-based nature and their deep-rooted connections to their lands have limited their ability to adapt to the nature of work and commerce in the 21stcentury. Without the tradition of working for monetary gain and the structures for a proper education system, these communities have often been left behind, swamped by drastic and rapid change, resulting in many of these communities having to struggle in order to survive in the modern economy. The change that the world experienced was therefore detrimental to these communities and their way of life as they did not have the conditions and structures needed to allow them to adapt in the modern world, leaving them vulnerable to the winds of change in the social, economic and technological domains. Besides traditional values, certain marginalized communities such as the poor bear the brunt of the negative repercussions of change due to their conditions and situations they find themselves in. The poor and uneducated sometimes find it challenging to pick up new skills and adapt to new technologies in a world that evolves at breakneck pace, where industries are constantly being disrupted and cheap foreign labour depresses their wages. Taxi drivers in Malaysia have protested against technological companies like Grab and Uber for threatening their livelihood, for instance, and they do not have any recourse against such obtrusive change. Thus, change can sometimes be undesirable as different communities adapt and come to terms with change at different paces, leaving many communities to suffer as the world speeds towards the future.\nOverall, to assert that change is always good would be an overgeneralisation of the nature of change and its many facets, while ignoring the detrimental effects that change can bring if it is not properly managed. Although change does have its benefits, these do come with their own sets of challenges which could in fact be worse than what we had experienced before. Ultimately, change is neither inherently bad nor innately good and a lot depends on how change is managed and how it is received by different groups within society."

                "prompt": "Science will always have noble intentions.' Discuss.",
                "text": "In today's fast-paced world where knowledge and speed have become increasingly crucial, the various branches of science have made notable advancements to deepening our understanding of the natural order, as well as benefitting mankind in multiple ways. From tightening security measures to preventing terrorism to creating new medicines to cure diseases, scientific advancements seemingly have noble intentions to benefit people in several ways. However, the rapid advancement of science has also led to its misuse. With the rise of profit-driven companies and terrorist groups, many become ambivalent about the \"noble\" intentions of science. Hence, while it is compelling to concede that the various branches of science have noble intentions to benefit mankind, science can nonetheless inflict harm and unleash massive destruction on the human race if it falls into the wrong hands.\nFirst, people have enjoyed the scientific advancements that encompass high moral principles. Extensive medical research has vastly strengthened the understanding of the human biology and expanded the range of cures for previously untreatable maladies. For example, the discovery of the structure of DNA was a fundamental breakthrough in biology. It formed the underpinnings of research that would ultimately lead to a wide variety of practical applications, including DNA fingerprinting, genetically engineered crops, and tests for genetic diseases. Vaccination is also one of the greatest breakthroughs in modern medicine. No other medical intervention has done more to save lives and improve quality of life. Smallpox ravaged and killed thousands of people in Europe in the 18th century. Once a person had caught it, the disease would kill around a third of victims and leave survivors scarred or blinded. Thankfully, smallpox was officially wiped out in 1980. If it were still common, it would cause an estimated 2 million deaths every year around the world. Science's noble intention has been vividly manifested in the many lives it has saved and the prolonging of man's life expectancy. According to the 2014 CIA World Factbook, the average global mortality rate between 1950 and 1955 was about 19.5%. However, between 2010 and 2015, the average mortality rate halved to below 8.3%while the life expectancy of the people around the world increased by 25 years over the same period. Hence in the aspect of medical science, it is reasonable to claim that science has lofty intentions.\nFurthermore, the twin weapons of science and technology possess the noble intention of boosting efficiency andconvenience in people's everyday lives as well aspreventing potential crimes beforehand. Modern science has dramatically reduced the time taken to accomplish a host of pursuits through technological breakthroughs and increasing mechanisation, and has led to a more interconnected world economy, which is a powerful driver of growth, productivity, job creation and poverty reduction. On topof the rapid development of information and communications technology, the evolution of modern transportation has also contributed to a \"shrinking\" world. Indeed, the present day aircraft has allowed people to travel around the world, cutting significant amount of time if people were to travel by traditional methods. And China is one giant beneficiary of such forces of globalisation, evident in its high GDP growth. Since its market reforms began, the economy enjoyed a historically unprecedented growth rate –an average annual growth rate of about 9 per cent for 25 years. In the last 3 decades, China alone has lifted more people out of extreme poverty than the rest of the world combined. Indeed, China's ($1/day) poverty reduction of 627 million from 1981 to 2005 exceeds the total global economy's decline in its extremely poor from 1.9 billion to 1.4 billion over the same period. The proven applications of science have thus underscored its noble intention of creating a more efficient and accessible global village for all of us to live in. However, with the rise of capitalism and profit-maximising enterprises, the noble intentions of science may have become less apparent. Indeed, in a capitalist world where monetary gains are used as a yardstick of economic and social success, many individuals and companies exploit science for greater profits but at a huge social cost. Few years ago, a multinational giant Monsanto introduced a genetically modified corn, which they claimed to be highly resistant to pests and could withstand extreme weather conditions.\nHowever, the genetically modified corn was found to have significantly disrupted liver and kidney functions according to a study released by the International Journal of Biological Sciences. Despite the findings, Monsanto continues to disregard the product safety concerns that threaten public health in pursuit of profits. Such self-serving behaviour may be traced to the selfish intentions of science, that is to amass wealth for oneself at the expense of others. Hence, there may be less incentive for science to have honourable intentions atall times under the modern capitalist system where the primary goal is the accumulation of individual wealth without any regard to a moral compass.\nMoreover, science will not have noble intentions when it is used to develop weapons. Nuclear science, the study of a nucleus of an atom and its reactions has provided mankind a completely new way to produce huge amounts of energy for people's consumption. On the hand, nuclear science can be used to create a destructive weapon capable of wiping a whole city awayfrom the surface of the Earth. This has caused many nations and terrorist groups to develop nuclear weapons in order to outrun the others in the arms race and protect its country. In World War Two, cities of Nagasaki and Hiroshima in japan faced the firstdestructive power of nuclear weapons, killing thousands of people in the city instantly. More recently, North Korea developed its nuclear weapon to threaten various countries, forcing the United Nations to accept certain demands made by the Prime Ministerof North Korea, Kim Jung Il. Again, people created develop such weapons to gain power against other nations, and intentions to maintain high moral principles during its scientific developments can be said to be non-existent. Thus, science will not have noble intentions if science was used to develop for the gain of power.\nIn conclusion, science often bears noble intentions to benefit humanity, in ways such as prolonging and saving lives,heightening productivity and paving the way for one world marked by unprecedented global economic and social development . However, as Albert Einstein had said, \"Most people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character\", some capitalists may use science to fulfil their self-interests instead."

                "prompt": "There are certain things that the media have the responsibility not to report.' Discuss.",
                "text": "The role of the media is to report and provide information, and to shape the perspectives of people through its disseminationof information to the general public. There is a diverse arrayof topics which could be covered in the media*, but there are also particular subjects that should not be publicised under any circumstances, due to reasons such as the possible invasion of personal privacy, or even potentially putting the safety of the country at risk. It is essential to realize that it is the liability of the media to exercise discretion wisely to ensure that privacy and security at all levels are preserved. To be more specific, issues that should be kept at length from public discussion or discourse include information on national security, gruesome images or details and personal confidential information.\nThe responsible media have the obligation to restrict the circulation of security information, especially when it jeopardises the national security of an entire country. It is imperative to guarantee the protectionof the country's top-secret documents and information, whose leakage could potentially unleash widespread destruction. This includes information relating to defence against national threats such as transnational terrorism. The media should uphold the executive orders set out by governments such as the recently revised United States government classification system, in which it lays out the system of classification, declassification and handling of national security information generated by the U.S. government and its employeesand contractors, as well as information received from other governments. Such security measures demonstrate the immense significance of handling national security information with care in which the responsible media should not breach. Moreover, another case discusses how WikiLeaks and its founder Julian Assange, were under fire for posting more than a quarter million secret U.S. documents, many of which threatened national security. WhenThe New York Timespublished these U.S. State Department papers, the U.S. Air Force responded by blocking its personnel from accessing the news sites with published leaked cables. The availability of such sensitive information might endanger the US and coalition personnel since the warring methods and strategies were disclosed to the enemies. These two examples evidently prove that leaking classified information threatens the national security of a country, which explains why every government places great value on upholding the confidentiality of such information. Therefore, the media have a responsibility to refrain from providing information that endangers the national security and may precipitate the collapse of the national social fabric.\nAnother condition that the media must consider before publication is the manner in which it describes heinous crimes. The media must recognise the fine line between helping its audience to vividly comprehend the atrocity of the crime, and offending its readers or viewers, particularly children. Consequently it is crucial that the media takes into consideration the audience to which it is targeting by the use of the demographic factor. Indeed, young children who are simple-minded and undiscerning may be easily manipulated by others' perceptions and false factual information. Hence, it is vital that undiscriminating children are sheltered from the profanity, nudity, violence and obscenity we often encounter in the media as adults as it may undermine their beliefs and value system. Nonetheless, there may be readers, apart from children, who are not able to stomach the violence and monstrosity contained in the graphic images or details. To exemplify this, the censoring of morbid images and videos of the Iraq War for the American society was essential to prevent any permanent damaging psychological effects on the general audience. Thus, it is absolutely critical for the media to exercise prudence in ensuring that the materials it produces for public viewing are acceptable across all age groups, so as to not offend any of its viewers. Last but not least, it is the onus of the media to safeguard the privacy and confidentiality of any individuals such as witnesses, victims, or sometimes even the perpetrators of crime. When it comes to victims of rape, for instance, the identities of these victims have to be concealed to protect them from public harassment, discrimination or shame. In the case of the rape victim of the actor Michael Le Vell**, after her name was revealed on Twitter, a man suspected ofdisclosing this information was detained. Greater Manchester's police superintendent Phil Davies justified these actions of detainment as public identifications of victims of sex abuse, in particular child victims engaged in court proceedings can cause both immediate and long-term distress and harm. The management of information concerning victims of crime should not be taken lightly as this could be severely damaging and detrimental to their psychological wellbeing, and may also adversely impact their recovery process. For that reason, the media have the duty to ensure the privacy of individuals such as the victims, witnesses and young perpetrators of crime, to protect their identities and any confidential information. To sum up, the media should exercise vigilancebefore bringing up any issue in the vast array of topics. It is the responsibility of the media to protect certain sensitive national security information or confidential individual information. The media should also censor mentally-damaging images to safeguard the psychological wellbeing of its viewers and ensure that they are not at risk of any future repercussions, which may lead to dysfunctional lives.Therefore, governments in any country should work closely with the media to ensure these objectives aren't adequately, so as to maximise the welfare of the citizens."

                "prompt": "'The key criterion for good government is how well the economy is managed.' Is this is fair assessment?",
                "text": "The past century saw momentous changes in governments, with centuries-old monarchies being replaced with communist and democratic governments and the eventual triumph of democracy over communism. Such critical developments have been accompanied by many definitions on what constitutes a good government. In the modernsense, a good government can be broadly defined as one that cares for the welfare of the people, putting it above all other considerations. This coupled together with a largely capitalist society might suggest that a government with a well managed economy is a good government. However, I find this an unfair assessment as it is an overly narrow assessment criterion for a healthy economy is just one of the many products of a good government.Instead, I would argue that the key criterion should be accountability and transparency, which will ensure the social and economic well being of its citizens, through low level of corruptness and political stability. On the other hand, some economists would claim that a healthy economy is the hallmark of a good government. Indeed strong gross domestic product (GDP) growth can boost a country's living standards, as with a higher income, the citizens would be better able to satisfy their material needs. For instance, Botswana has registered one of the highest average economic growth rates in Africa since its independence whileaccumulating negligible foreign debt.This has since catapulted poverty-striken Botswana to a middle-income country, withliving standards comparable to that of Turkey,without sacrificing its future welfare. Therefore, it would be tempting to conclude that if a government can manage its economy well, it is a good government.\n However, we should not be misled by that fallacy, as such success stories are few and far between, more often than not, such growth is accompanied by significant trade-offs. Some of these trade-offs could include neglectingthe environment which would negatively impact the non-material living standards. The epitome of this trade-offbetween economic growth and environmental health is China. Ever since she has opened up her economy, the pursuit of economic profit has led to the fast-paced proliferation of factories in cities that discharge unchecked levels of pollutants at an alarming rate. The situation has since worsened till the point that only one percent of its urban population breathes air that is considered safe by European Union standards. Therefore, it can be seen that even though a country can achieve remarkable double-digit economic growth rate, it comes at a hefty health cost, calling the key criterion of good government as \"how well the economy is managed\" into question.\nInstead,accountability and transparency, an integral part of many representative democracies globally, should be the key criterion when it comes to assessing governments. Having strong accountability and transparency means that the government has to make public the processes and justifications that lead to the implementation of its policies. Increasing citizen participation can help to expose and stave off corrupt practices, ensuring that taxpayers' money is well spent and that does not discriminate any religious or ethnic groups. For example, the Scandinavian countries such as Norway, Denmark and Sweden, have reported high levels of transparency and accountability in their governments, coming in among the top five in the 2014 Corruption Perception Index. One of the factors taken into consideration is to have full disclosure of the budget, in fact, they were shown to have the most open budget globally in 2012. Given that the government is trustworthy, ethical, responsible and accountable to thepublic, it is no surprise that Norway has continued to be the most prosperous country globally in 2014. Hence, accountability and transparency is key, more so than a well managed economy, for any government that wishes to remain in powerin the twenty-first century.\nStill, such a view has drawn flak from some academics even though studies have shown that good governance is correlated with strong transparency, accountability and economic growth. There is a fear that having too much transparency may bring more harm than good as it would impede the policy making process.This view is supported by a University of Pennsylvania Law research paper that stated that full disclosure of the policy making process may inadvertently cause the leakage of firms' trade secrets that were provided to the government. Companies, being fearful of acts that could dent their profits, would then feel less obliged andrestrict the quality and quantity of information that is made available to the government.Therefore, with incomplete and insufficient evidence or knowledge to craft policies, the final legislature could end up being a bane to the country. Thus, the argument against transparency being a key criterion for an efficient government may hold true despite being seemingly counter-intuitive.\nHowever, some intellectuals contend that the main criterion for good government is to uphold and protect individual rights. Such a government helps to protect our freedom to life, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and the right to vote, inter alia. These are essential features that strengthen civil society development, tolerance and respect for others. They hold that incidents such as the FBI's harassment of civil rights leaders, the Army's spying on the anti-war movement in the 1960s, and more recently, in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the passing of the Patriot Act by President Bush and the Republican Congress, have all but severely undermined the citizens' basic rights and freedoms. The U.S. government greatly increased wiretapping and other forms of surveillance of citizens, often without any evidence of any wrongdoing on their part. Thousands of people were secretly detained for months without any charges against them. Suspected terrorists were denied lawyers and the right to a trial. Some suspects were even sent abroad to other countries so they could be tortured. And 2005 and 2006 revealed the existence of extensive domestic spying programs by the National Security Agency and other institutions that are legally forbidden from doing so –a very disturbing development. Nonetheless,while government policies can sometimes threaten our freedoms, our legislatures and courts are also often the most effective avenues for defending and expanding our rights and liberties –for the general good –based on utilitarianism.\nIn conclusion, it is unfair and misguided to posit that the key criterion for good government is how well the economy is managed. It ignores the fact that accurately assessing a government's levels of efficiency and competency is both complicated and perplexing. While a well-managed economy may be able to signal the high degree of competency of a government through the fulfilment of citizens' material well-being, this overly simplistic measure fails to provide a holistic evaluation of the government. Hence, a more superior assessment should also include criteria such as accountability and transparency andto a smaller extent, democratic rights.\nIndeed, countries are increasingly cognisant of the importance of using a multifaceted approach to measure their political monoliths."

                "prompt": "Is there a more urgent need for religion in today's world?",
                "text": "It is a grave time for religion. Religion-inspired violence seems to permeate through multiple media outlets, from the Islamic State and Israeli–Palestinian conflicts in the Middle East to the Burmese Buddhist monks terrorising Muslims in Myanmar.Given religion's support for barbarism under the veneer of peace, many have since questioned the relevance and need for religion in today's modernised world, even suggesting adopting a more secular way of life. However, this is a myopic perception of religion, as it fails to weigh the value that religion provides in the form of emotional and social support, that could potentially serve as the remedy to current societal ills by bridging the gaps in today's increasingly radicalised world. Hence, I would argue that there is a moreurgent need for religion in today's world.\nOn the other hand, some scientists and religious critics would argue otherwise, calling religion a hindrance to scientific advancements and its followers delusional. Conflicts often arise due to disagreements between scientific facts and religious scriptures, such as in the case of the Heliocentric versus the Geocentric models of the Solar System and the Darwinian Evolution versus Creationism. There have been cases where religious fanatics often are unable to accept the damning scientific evidence presented against them and instead argue that their archaic texts are infallible. Furthermore, religion has the ability to instil fanaticism among its fervent believers, clouding their ability to make rational judgements and remaindeaf to alternate verifiable scientific explanations. Additionally, such conflicts can have widespread implications in areas such as in the education system. For instance, in the United States, there are cases where provisions in the syllabus were made to acknowledge the existence of other evolutionary models yet was abused to teach Creationism while often demeaning and derogating Darwinian Evolution.Such attempts at instilling religious ideology intoyoung impressionable minds could hamper their critical thinking skills and the future development of the country. Thus, leading some to argue that religion is a burden and hence not required in the 21st century.\nMoreover, the susceptibility of the average human mind to religious doctrines and their backward thinking might impede the scientific and technological advancements of mankind. However, this does not mean all religions are necessarily harmful. Instead, religions may prove to be essential in providing strong emotional support, such as when dealing with moral scruples and understanding the meaning of life. For most individuals, religion forms the basis of their morals. For example, the ten commandants ofChristianity states \"thou shall not murder\" and Buddhism's eightfold path promotes the \"right speech\" and \"right action\" where one should say nothing that hurts others and work for the rights of others respectively. While abiding by these principles may involve immense efforts and commitment, these central tenets nevertheless provide fundamental insights into how one can lead a meaningful life. Moreover, recent scientific forays into space have led to the bleak and gloomy outlook that the universe may eventually end. This may have led some to believe that life is meaningless and is all for naught. Consequently, the conciliatory role of religion becomes increasingly important as it offers a psychological solution by elucidating the constructs of heaven and an afterlife that provide solace and comfort amid such depressing frames of mind. Hence, despite its apparent flaws, the emotional element of religion is needed more so than ever in today's rapidly evolving world plagued with insecurities.\nFurthermore, many religions seek to provide social support for the underclass. In spite of the massive strides made by the global community in alleviating absolute poverty,most notably the drastic decrease of over 70 per cent since 1978, many around the world still live in relative poverty. This is evident in a 2006 United Nations study that found the top one per cent of the world controls more wealth than the bottom 95% altogether. To these people struggling in the quagmire of poverty, religion plays a pivotal social support role in these pressing times. For instance, the Sikhs openly welcome visitors to their Gurdwaras, their place of worship. Many homeless non-Sikhs often turn up at these places looking for food and shelter, to the extent that over five thousands meals were served in the 250 Gurdwaras in 2013 in Britain alone. Additionally, most religions stipulate that their followers should care for the economic well-being of those in their communities through acts of charity. For instance, a central concern in the Qur'an is the treatment of the poor, marginalized, and disadvantaged. Islamic teachings enjoin all Muslim adults, who are financially able, to make donations and pay an obligatory alms tax of a percentage of their assets . In fact, Muslims had been named as being the most generous in the United Kingdom in 2012, as they donated more than the Christians, Jews and Atheists. This highlights the indispensability of religion which provides an additional social safety net alongside government aid and given the current economic turmoil arising from the Eurozone crisis, such unconditional help has proven to be especially invaluable. Thus, from a realistic point of view, there is a more urgent need for religion in today's world.\nIn conclusion, while religion may have its shortcomings, but so is every human construct. The arguments outlined earlier have illuminated the far-reaching merits of religion, specifically the emotional and social assistance religion can offer in today's globalised world inundated with unprecedented complexityand dynamic competition. Therefore, dispelling religion for its flaws does not do justice to these beneficial attributes that are in fact worthy of respect and appreciation. However, to avoid a head-on confrontation between science and religion in search of worldly answers, it is important to cultivate wisdom instead of following one's faith blindly. Therefore, as long as pious people interpret their religious principles in the context of their own cultural background and take responsibility for their faith in the environment they inhabit by adapting to the changing societal norms and expanding academia, religion would continue to provide more solutions than problems in today's world."

                "text": "Technology, which is the application of science used to satisfy endless human desires has played a key role in solving the many pertinent issues that are plaguing our society today. In the 21st century, where technology is extremely advanced and increasingly ubiquitous, it has indeed served as a major force in remedying some of the major crises such as global warming, epidemics and pandemics, and global terrorismthat have beleaguered our world today. However, relying on technology alone may prove to begrossly insufficient in defusing these crises and it should instead be complemented by other equally important factors such as effective government administration as well asstrong, positive cultural and societal influences. Hence, I do not entirely agree with the proposition. Indeed, technology plays an important role in solving dire environmental problems suchas global warming and rampant deforestation that are damaging the world. Global warming has posed many problems for mankind. Take for example, the widespreadmelting ofpolar ice caps. This not only has grave consequences for humans, wildlife, and plants; its most serious impact may be on rising sea levels. By 2100, it is estimated that our oceans will be one to four feet higher, threatening coastal systems and low-lyingareas. Deforestation has been another major environmental issue that mankind faces. Many natural environments have been cleared to pave the way for urbanisation and additionally, because of the forces of globalisation, it has exacerbated the present environmental concerns. According to World Health Organisation (WHO) over the past 30 years, natural environments have declined nearly 30%, with the population of freshwater species nearly halved and the natural forested areas reduced by 10%. Technology, in this case, has helped to mitigate some of these issues at hand. For example, a group of researchers from George Washington University claim to have achieved at a recent meeting of the American Chemical Society to be able to develop a technology to economically convert atmospheric CO2 directly into highly valued carbon nanofibers for industrial and consumer products. It is said to be able to reduce the level of carbon dioxide down to the pre-industrial level in the next decade, reversing the effects of global warming. Such a device not only converts harmful greenhouse gases into useful products for consumers to use, its scalability and high land-use efficiency also take pressure off deforestation. Such cutting edge technology presents a new age where technology has become truly indispensable in alleviating environmental problems.\nDespite its instrumental role, technology can only realise its full gains if people are willing to embark on this journey together to address the environmental woes. Indeed, populist pressures can harness their huge power to influence authorities to take actions against errant companies or individuals who partake in disastrous environmental programs. For instance, according to a report by McKinsey & Company, having recognised that these environmental problems are systemic. through their activism, the Chinese people are pushing the government to do more and are laying the foundation to transform China's environmental protection laws. As a first step, the Chinese people have clearly understood that prudent environmental policies depend on open and accurate environmental data. As a result, the Chinese media –the Communist government's mouthpiece –has been fervently producing eye-opening, in-depth investigative reports on a myriad of environmental problems from air pollution to water pollution. This evidently shows how critical is the people's voice in the piece of action in saving the shared environment.\nMoreover, with the support of capablegovernment leadership, technology has immenselymitigated the dire effects of the epidemics that proliferate in the world today. Many of the diseasestoday are extremely malignant, having a fast rate of transmission and alarming levels of casualties as a result.Furthermore, it has translated into a heavier burden on an individual in their medical cost and a decrease in labour productivity should the disease spread to many people. For example, a scourge of the world is smallpox where an estimated 300 million people died from it in the 20th century alone.Such a death toll vividly shows the severity ofthe disease outbreak that can threaten the survival of mankind if no proper safeguards are put in place. Fortunately, technology has given rise to many new vaccines that manage to successfully contain and eradicate the host of contagions that have occurred throughout over the last century. For instance, Singapore's Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) and Switzerland's Cytos Biotechnology AG announced that the first healthy volunteer has been dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial with their H1N1 influenza vaccine candidate based on Cytos' proprietary bacteriophage Qbeta virus-like particle (VLP) technology where the safety and immunogenicity of this novel vaccine candidate and its potential to protect against H1N1 influenza infection will be evaluated. Although such timely medical treatments have been paramount, the aversion of an apocalyptic crisis would have not been successful without the effective government administration manifested in the use of contingency plans.At the end of the 1960s, while smallpox was still endemic in Africa and Asia, vaccination campaigns, surveillance and prevention measures aimed to contain epidemic hotspots and to better inform affected populations made huge unprecedented contributions to surmounting the epidemic. Through all these efficacious strategies and collaborative efforts of countries,smallpox was officially declared eradicated in 1980 and is the first disease to have been fought on a global scale.This sterling result has evidently shown how imperative is effective publicplanning in the medical field which ultimately led to the complete eradication of the malady.\nIn conclusion, while technology is an important key to solve major crisis in the world, it is no panacea.We have to rely on other equallyvital elementssuch as societal influence and competentgovernment administration to bring sustainable answersto the pressing world issues of modern day."

                "prompt": "Is the library redundant in today's world?",
                "text": "P.J O'Rourke, an American political satirist and journalist, once said \"The library, with its Daedalian labyrinth, mysterious hush, and faintly ominous aroma of knowledge, has been replaced by the computer's cheap glow, pesky chirp, and data spillage. Indeed, ever since the influx of technology, the function of libraries has been greatly eroded in today's modern society. Many people predict that the library,once a building that houses vast array of books, periodicals, music and film for use or borrowing of the public, is on the verge of becoming a ghost town, irrelevant and nothing more than a past memory. Despite such claims, I disagree with the proposition as physical libraries are beginning to adapt to the technological changes sweeping acrossthe world. Besides, their function as a place of gathering remains unchallenged and lastly, its cultural appeal to the public persists.\nUndoubtedly, the pervasiveness of the internet has rendered the physical library obsolete as knowledge and information can be stored online. The internet has become a substitute for libraries as it can store a vast amount of information that is made accessible to the masses. This helps to greatly reduce the inconvenience of travelling and searching for information in a library. Furthermore, the advent of the internet has allowed people to gain access to electronic books and movies that can be found in libraries. For instance, Amazon, the eminent online retailer has begun the sale of their Kindle E-readers which serve to make it easy and comfortable for consumers to hold in one hand for extended periods of time. This developmentbefits today'sglobalised world where time and convenience are of keyessence as people are continuously on the go (evidentin the rising popularity of the jet-setting lifestyle) and a visit to the library isdenigratedto a time-consuming and unworthy affair. Despite the benefits digital library can bring, we cannot underestimate the importance of physical libraries. Both physical and digital libraries are interdependent of each other and the synergy formed between them will both play an essential role in providing access to knowledge in countriesaround the world in the near future. According to John Palfrey's new book: Why Libraries Matter More Than Ever in the Age of Google, he believes that without physical libraries, we will lose essential public, intellectual spaces in our communities, places where people can meet face-to-face. Thus we shouldbuild digital libraries connected to physical libraries to meet our exploding need for knowledge and intellectual exchanges, which grow in tandem with rising literacy rates and betterquality of life. Hence,it is vital that physical libraries continue to operate alongside digital libraries for visitors to make the most out of them. Firstly, libraries are beginning to adapt to changes in the world by constantly reinventing themselves to keep up with current trends. Nowadays, libraries are trying to serve a wide range of patrons at many different points along an \"adoption curve\" with all-print at one end and all-digital at the other. People are now able to have access to a huge database of e-resources and make use of technology to search for their desired materials. Libraries are also increasingly upgrading their services such as free wireless and intricate designs to provide a comfortable environment for users to gather and conduct their own activities. For instance, in Singapore, ever since the National Library Board (NLB) has launched the new Library@Orchard in 2014, it has attracted many users, especially young peopleas it serves as a courtyard for youths to congregate and its heavy emphasis on design, together with state of the arts digital access to e-books, is able to compete with commercialised establishments such as Starbucks. Thus, it clearly shows how physical libraries are advancing to keep in touch with the current trends to make themselves evermore relevant in our lives.\nFurthermore, libraries serve as a refuge for citizens who are burdened by their work demands. A libraryis still a sanctuarythat preserves the peace and quiet atmosphere it has, making it a suitable destination for many to relax. In the midstof the heavy workloads and cutthroat competition in today's globalised society, many turn to libraries to seek comfort and solace in books and allow their imagination to run wild or live an alternate reality and discover new hobbies. For example, in The Sacramento Public Library in California, is one of a few dozen libraries in the country to embrace the \"maker movement\", in which people use technology, such as robotics and 3-D printing, to create handicrafts and other objects. The management believes that libraries are now becoming hands-on creative hubs, places where people can learn new crafts and experiment with technology such as 3-D printers. This not only helps people to detach their minds off their hectic schedule, it also helps to shelter them from the pressures of our modern day society which is heavily concerned with productivity and gains in material wealth. Therefore, I believe that libraries are cardinalplaces thatallow people to soothe their minds and discover their new strengths andinterests.\nFinally, people have recognised that libraries play an imperative role in preserving a country's heritage today. A library can also be considered a national monument that helps to safeguarda nation's heritage and shows how a country has advanced and developed throughout the years. Many bemoan the demolishment of these iconic buildings that helped people form a collective history and define their very own identities. Demolishing it to the pave the way for urban development would be seen as ripping away a considerable aspect of a country's identity. The old National Library in Singapore is a prime example of how such symboliclandmarks had to make way for urban development which received much public dissent in 2004. The controversy of such a demise has sparked greater awareness of local cultural roots and an unprecedented wave in favour of heritage conservation among Singaporeans. This shows how much people value such sentimental buildings that hadonce played a significant role in our heritage. Thus, libraries are not redundant in today's world as many still have cultural appeal and historical significance that anchor us together and establish a sense of identity for us.\nIn conclusion, libraries continue to have an indispensable role in today's society. They have brought about a raft ofadvantages, inter alia, a place for relaxation and indulgence and an institution that reinforces our roots."

                "prompt": "In your view, which three specific areas of scientific research should be mankind's priorities in the next decade and why?",
                "text": "Scientific discoveries, technological breakthroughs, and innovation are the primary engines for expanding the frontiers of human knowledge and are vital for responding to the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century. In the next decade, mankind is likely to launch into new scientific research areas in the journey to constantly enhance our quality of living. There is a diverse range of potential aspects of scientific research to be considered, and it is crucial for us to make an informed decision on which areas should be prioritized as it vastly affects the extent and speed of our progress. As of now and moving forward, a few of the many aspects of scientific research that are being prioritized include clean energy, environmental preservation and food genetics.\nWith our increasing global population size, we should prioritise the scientific research and development on food genetics. Studies haveshown that globally, the population size is projected to reach 9 billion by 2050. This would entail a serious shortage of vital resources such asfood in future. As of now, we are already facing a problem of food shortage. An article by Science Daily reports that the current increases projected for crop production from biotechnology, genetics, agronomics and horticulture will not be sufficient to meet global food demand. In the report, a professor of horticultural sciences strongly advocates the development of more efficient technologies and high yielding crops to address this challenge. It is thus important for mankind to focus on improving the yield of food production and its nutritional value to adequately prepare ourselves for the drastic increase in population size by 2030.\nNonetheless, gainsayers might argue that food genetics should not be one of the main focuses of scientific research in the next decade because the food shortage faced in the rural areas of developing world is a result of costly food items that are not affordable to the majority. Hence they might feel that increasing production yield would not be targeting the root cause of the problem, unlike hefty food subsidy handouts. However, these detractors fail to realize that improvements in the quality and quantity of genetically modified food would undoubtedly lead to a lower cost of production for farmers, which in turn would result in lower prices and higher nutritional value for consumers. Thus the concern of exorbitant food prices would be addressed with the improvement of crop yield. Therefore, I believe that by prioritizing the research on food genetics, we would be able to curb the looming issue of global food shortage and world hunger. Hence I feel that food genetics should be one of the three key areas of scientific research in the next decade, especially in the face of a rapidly growing world population.\nAnother area of scientific research, which would be greatly constructive in the next decade, is renewable energy. The projected population growth will doubtlessly imposea greater constraint on the energy resources as we now live in an era where energy is the engine of economic growth and development. It is thus important for mankind to prioritise the scientific research on renewable energy, especially on the discovery ofnew renewable energy sources before the issue of the energy crunch kicks in when the global demand for energy accelerates as a result of the rapidly expanding population. Presently, we primarily obtain energy from the burning of fossil fuels such as natural gas, coal, petroleum and oil. Studies have shown that if we are to continue relying on crude oil as our main source of energy at this rate, there will only be enough for 42 years, implying that we may be facing a severe depletion of this precious energyresource. It is hence essential for us to uncover new and innovative means to obtain renewable energy. Renewable energy is important in sustaining mankind's economic development and environmental preservation. Renewable energy, by definition, is inexhaustible in contrast to fossil fuels, which will eventually run out. This is a pivotal point to consider in the light of our steadily growing population size facing diminishing fossil fuel supplies as the rate of depletion significantly outpaces the rate of discovery and extraction. Hence renewable energy would be a more desirable alternative to fossil fuels. Another major benefit of renewable energy is that such forms of energy have limited environmental impact. Good These clean forms of energy generate minimal pollution and emissions, if not at all. Good On the contrary, the refinement process of crude oil produces many solid toxic wastes such as mercury and other heavy metals, and the burning of fossil fuels often discharges arsenic and lead into surface waters while both release a substantial amount of pollutants into the air. These pollutants cause respiratory illnesses and deaths in humans, and give rise to acid rain, which erodes infrastructure and destroys fragile eco-systems. These harmful effects are very detrimental to our economic development and environment, greatly hampering global productivity as a consequence. Therefore,it would be wise to focus on the research on sources of renewable energy.\nLast but not least, another important area of research should be targeted at the issues of environmental degradation caused by pollution and global climate change. Increasing technological advancement has also yielded greater environmental damage in the form of pollutant emissions, which have long-lasting effects on our commonly shared environment. For example, the increasing mechanization and commercialization of agricultural produce causes water pollution and disrupts eco-systems and aquatic life. Besides, pollutants emitted from deforestation contribute to global warming, which could escalate into a environmental crisis if not properly managed and dealt with. It also causes soil erosion that results in land degradation. These are pressing environmental issues that can majorly impact mankind and his future. Thus, it is vital for us to prioritise scientific research in existing and potential environmental issues and the ways to alleviate them. Therefore,I feel that in the next decade, environmental preservation should be one of the key priorities of scientific research, especially in an increasingly industrialized world.\nIn conclusion, the three key areas of scientific research to be prioritized in the next decade are the research and development on food genetics, renewable energy, as well as environmental sustainability and protection. By simultaneously targeting all three areas, the aggregate impact may be substantially greater than the individual impacts since the benefits are mutually reinforcing, such as the use of renewable energy would also help to improve the problem of environmental degradation. This should be the top mandate in the next decade, where technology will continue to flourish alongside with the exponential increase of population, in pursuit of sustainable future progress and growth."

                "prompt": "Is science a threat to society?",
                "text": "The dawn of the twenty-first century has seen mankind's understanding of the world grow exponentially. This has led to a large number of creature comforts in our everyday lives that range from LED televisions to high speed internet connection. However, like all great advancements, science is also marred by its potential dangers. For instance, nuclear research has led to the harnessing of nuclear power as one of the most viable environmentally friendly methods of power generation. At the same time, it is also extremely risky to pursue, as exemplified bythe 1986 Chernobyl disaster which made Chernobyl inhabitable till date. A graver concern would be the prospects of genetically modified food becoming a staple in our diets and embryonic stem cell research becoming commonplace. As a result, such developments have led to more people expressing great discomfort with the direction and pace at which science is currently heading to, given our lack of understanding in the possible repercussions presented by science.Nonetheless, staunch science activists in the pharmaceutical industry remain convinced that only by delving into the unknown through scientific sophistication could we further our understanding of our body and unlock the limitless future value of medicine. Additionally, agricultural scientists are alsoconvicted that more research is the solution to feeding the burgeoning world population that is expected to hit 9 billion by 2050. Thus, despite the potential hazards elucidated, I am inclined to disagree that science poses a threat to society and instead, I believe that science should be further developed to address the menaces.\nIt is evident that science has its potential risks, given ourscant knowledge about new areas of science such as genetic modification and embryonic stem cell research. which has led to the critiques by numerous theists and conspiracy theorists. The furore over genetic modification can be best understood from the possible severity of harm that could be inflicted on our body, whereas for embryonic stem cell research, it would be the violation of the sanctity of life. Indeed, many criticise genetic modification as meddling with nature by \"playing God\". They believe that transplanting a gene from one species to another may cause detrimental effects on our health and wellbeing. For example, it was found by a research paper that rats that were fed genetically modified corn grew malignant stomach tumours. Thus, it can be seen that if genetically modified food is introduced as a staple, modern societies could be stricken with such harmful diseases. Alas, on the issue of embryonic stem cell research, the state-of-the-art method toextract embryonic stem cell inevitably kills the embryo in the process. As an embryo is viewed as a precious human life, it should thus be accorded the same respect and right to life as a fully developed human being. Science has to be rigorously tested and challenged in the ethical and moral landscapes. Consequently, given the fact that science does present real threats to our society either socially or physiologically, it is always in our best interest to direct our concerted effort to mitigating such risks.\nGiven the conceivable dangers that science poses, many might overlook the vast potential science has for solving many of our current problems. Science has repeatedly paved the way for life-saving inventions such as vaccination, X-ray machine and the MRI scanner that have helped to further develop the field of medicine. It is incontrovertible that vaccination has eradicated many deadly and contagious diseases like smallpox, that had resulted in the drastic increase in the average life expectancy from 31 in the early twentieth century to over 65 in 2010. Furthermore, with growing medical advancements, it is expected to exceed 75 by 2050. Despite the proven and potential health benefits science can bring, it is regrettable that embryonic stem cell has been consistently promulgated as murder when it may hold the key to future treatments for chronic and degenerative diseases such as heart diseases. Additionally, the embryos currently used for research are in reality leftovers from invitro fertilisation that would otherwise be destroyed. Thus, embryonic stem cell research should not be viewed as synonymous with murder but contribution to invaluable scientific research that would push the boundaries of our stock of knowledge in alleviating human suffering from illnesses. With such clear benefits that science can provide to our society, it is hence myopic and improvident to denounce it as a threat and hamper its progress.\nMoreover, a viable solution to the issue of food scarcity among the rapidly expanding world population might lie in genetic modification. Genetic scientists have developed crops that are hardier and more resistant to pestilence. These advantageous traits are especially beneficial at a time when the world is experiencing harsher and more extreme climates precipitated by destructive human activities that have resulted in food shortage in many regions. Scorching temperatures and scarce rainfall have left large swathes of the United States in drought, withthe 'breadbasket states', such as Iowa and Indiana, among the worst affected. The extreme weather conditions have wreaked havoc with the nation's crop production, particularly maize (corn) and soya beans. Given that the country is the world's top exporterof maize and one of the largest growers of soya beans,the drought has huge ramifications for global food supplies, but science is providing the much-needed help. Many scientists are trying to unravel the complex crop genetics that allows these crops to tolerate environmental extremes, and they hope to use conventional breeding methods to create varieties that perform even better. There has already been some success with sorghum, which has shown improved productivity in drought conditions that occur late in the growing season in temperate and tropical environments. Moreover, by splicing different genes together, researchers are able to produce organisms with higher nutritional value than their counterparts, for example the Golden Rice with a higher vitaminA content that its counterparts. This could be a crucial development to solving vitamin A deficiency in third world countries that experience limited food variety in their societies. Indeed, this can help to prevent growth retardation, strengthen the immune system and decrease the threat of infections. Furthermore, despite our little understanding of their long term effects, countless studies have been conducted to dispel the public misconceptions of genetically modified food. Studies that seem to demonstrate the dangers of genetically modified food have also been proven to be nothing more than fear mongering on numerous accounts. But in reality, it is upsetting to see many naysayers readily clinging on to such flawed theories that impede the scientific progress that could save a legion of lives. To turn the tide, more education should be made a requisite to upend the prevailing mindset that science is a threat to humanity.\nIn light of such arguments, it would thus be rational to stop stretching the truth that science is a threat but to view it in a balanced light. Many of those denouncing science as a threat are ignorant of the fact that our current living standards are made possible and sustainable through the liberation of the sciences. Granted, science could pose an inconspicuous threat to humanity, thus we should tread carefully and counter its concomitant dangers. Regulatory international bodies like the World Health Organisation and the United Nations can oversee worldwide scientific progress and be prompt in imposing sanctions and galvanising actions against errant groups that abuse science for their selfish interests. Nevertheless, science remains an essential part of our everyday life. Indeed, by learning more about the universe and the phenomena around us, science can be exploited to overcome most of our 21stcentury challenges. Therefore, it is unwise to stigmatise science as a threat to society and we should instead espouse further scientific endeavours."

                "prompt": "Is democracy, as is often assumed, often the best?",
                "text": "In ancient times, true democracy is one where the entire population has a sayin all decisionsin the country. Such a system has flaws such as the long time period that is required to collate all the votes and even so, the decision made might not entirely benefitthe population, as not all voters have the necessary knowledge to evaluate the claims made by their representatives and arrive at a rational choice.This brings us to our current definition of democracy where voters elect a representative to represent their views and vote for decisions which benefit his supporters. The predominance of democracy has come a long way since the post cold war era, which was marked by the massive popularity of 2 major opposing ideologies, communism and democracy. However, in thepast decades, a slew of eventful historical developments had eventually resulted in democracy emerging victorious. Although it may be too bold to assert that the ends justified the means, I do believe that democracy is often the best, given that certain modifications are undertaken. As with any other political systems, democracy is not without its flaws. The benefits of democracy could possibly be reversed by factors such as the limited knowledge of the population, selfish human nature and the huge power gap between the political representatives and the general public. Therefore, to reap the most advantages of democracy, such limitations would have to be adequately addressed with supplementary measures.\nIndeed, proponents of democracy argue that democracy is usually the best as it gives people the ultimate power to vote the government. In Singapore, every adult member of the populace, who is 21 years old and above, will get to vote a representative into government in a general election held once every 5 years. Democracy enables the fair representation of the interests of every adult, regardless of their socio-economic status. Through voting, everyone will get a chance to choose their political direction or inclination, and thus the political representatives and party that further their individual interests. Therefore, on a broader scale, the political party that claims the highest votes will head the government. In most countries where the ordinary working class constitutes the bulk of the populace, the elected political party may be deemed populistic. Thus, it could be opined that the majority of the decisions made may benefit most of the population and be generally deemed the best for a country. This perspective is in line with the principle of utilitarianism which advocates the proper evaluation of policies in light of their effect on the general well-being of the populations they involve.\nHowever, decisions made by the population may not be the best even if it is a fair representation of the people. During elections, political parties are often caught up in winning votes that they often present misleading information or present alternative policies with inadequate research. A country with such a warped political system would be India, which had seen 15 prime ministers head the country since its independence in 1954 with the shortest term limited to two hundred and thirty three days. Serving such a short term that is barely the length of a full year is extremely detrimental to the economy since most policies may not be seen through, leading to suboptimal results at best. Therefore, democracy in its raw form may not often be the best as it may cause political parties to lose sight of its actual aims and instead become a popularparty through deception to win its way into government. As such, it often results in the inability of the government to fulfil its promises given at the rallies.\nSecondly, although the elected individuals are mandated to represent their supporters and decide on policies that will benefit the country, they are ultimately still humans and thus are equally vulnerable to the same human temptations. As such they may become corrupt and implement venal policies for their personal selfish gains. An example is the previous president of Ukraine, Victor Yanukovych. He allegedly misappropriated part of Ukraine's savings to build his lavish mansion, which houses golden taps and a collection of motorcycles and cars worth millions of dollars. Up till now, he still insists that he funded his house with his savings, even though he merely earns fifteen thousand pounds annually. This notorious example has showcased the immense corruption that can possibly occur, where politicians entrenched in power may abuse the public trust and loyalty to their own favour. Thus, even if morally upright politicians are democratically elected, they may eventually succumb to financial temptations and often render democracy not the best political system.\nFinally, in many democratic countries today, many outcomes are premeditated by the political representatives while feedback and open discussions are often not sought from the people. Thus this has increasingly raised doubts on the level of \"democracy\" in a\"democratic society\". For example, in Singapore, there is a piece of legislation that was recently enacted which is often said to be a violation of Singaporeans' freedom of speech. This legislation is called the Online Licensing Framework, where this framework requires websites that report on Singapore news with a readership of at least 50,000 over a period of a month to pay for a license to continue operating. Furthermore, they have to obey any notices received from the government and take down any articles deemed as untruthful. This led to many Singaporeans, especially the anti-PAP (the incumbent ruling political party of Singapore) activists to express even greater dissatisfaction with the government. The distaste for this legislation stems from the factthat government is trying to limit the content Singaporeans get to read, thereby effectively diminishing the ability of Singaporeans to post their criticisms of the government. Therefore, democratic governments today, may run the risk of getting too much power which could lead to them unknowingly robbing the citizens of their rights. As such, democracy may not be generally the best.\nIn conclusion, even though democracy allows the people to have greater say in how their country is run, there are several unintended byproductsof the democratic systems due to the insufficient knowledge of the population, the shortcomings of human nature and the ability of politicians toabuse their power. Therefore, it is fair to conclude that democracy is often not the best system. Yet with felicitous modifications tomitigate its inherent ills, it will be a better system."

                "prompt": "Is foreign intervention justified?",
                "text": "As United Nations Peacekeepers of various foreign countries watched silently the systematic massacre of ethnic Bosnian Muslims by ethnic Serbs in a devastating campaign of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans, the world dealt with the bigger question of the efficacy and justifiability of foreign intervention. Intervention, ostensibly a relic of colonial practices and a historic \"white saviour complex\" continues to be used in a myriad of ways today - political, military, economic - yet opinions on its justifiability remain empirically polarised with competing notions of sovereignty and humanitarian obligations. I reject the preposterous postulation that one country's intervention in another's affairs is justifiable, on the grounds that such forms of intervention largely exacerbate the very problems they seek to ameliorate, worsening them both in the short and long term.\nTo the credit of detractors, however, it must be conceded that humanitarian intervention, only when requested for, in times of crisis can be justified as it can augment the efforts of local governments in protecting their people. Such a notion balances sovereignty with the need to best protect the interests of the people that domestic governments serve, under Rosseau's Social Contract by uniting members of the international community in a gesture of support by prioritising the protection of the inalienable human right to life over political differences. Simultaneously, other countries, by intervening with humanitarian personnel, aid packages and the relevant expertise, fulfill their obligations under the Responsibility to Protect framework that offers customary authority to other countries to intervene on behalf of a local government when the latter does not have the means to protect its people. This was seen in the case of the Haiti earthquake when the US provided humanitarian intervention, in Aceh following the 2004 tsunami, Japan following the Fukushima disaster, inter alia. Government aid agencies, coupled with NGO efforts, raised collateral and provided the personnel required to extract and treat victims of calamities far more efficiently than any lone government would have been able to, saving countless lives and simultaneously fulfilling obligations to the international community. Granted, these rescue efforts were in part maligned by accusations of corruption, among others, such as that of the American wing of World Vision International that was accused of embezzling one million US dollars due to improper oversight by the intervening government. However, to conclude that such instances render intervention unjustifiable is loose logic at best; the vast majority of humanitarian intervention efforts have augmented local government efforts and saved lives in crucial, dire times of crises and helped governments fulfill their obligations both to the people and the international community. They can thus be justified.\nHowever, there can be little justification for intervention beyond the humanitarian paradigm. Military intervention, typically targeted at deposing dictatorial authorities and championing certain rights or liberties further exacerbates the situation and denies civilians the very rights these efforts aim to champion. In principle, unauthorised intervention is a gross violation of sovereignty, the respect for the authority of other governments that preserves the fabric of international stability. In practice, it protracts violence, paves the path for further long-term instability and carries potential to develop unintended consequences with cataclysmic consequences for the nations involved. Fundamentally, foreign intervention in a conflict beyond one's own borders is unjustifiable as it may distort a state level conflict into a larger war of big powers. The involvement of USA and the Soviets in Vietnam protracted a previously milder regional conflict, and similarly the involvement of Lebanon (Hezbollah), Saudi Arabia, Kurdistan among others aforementioned complicated the Syrian Civil War, making the deposition of autocratic Assad an even greater impossibility today. Even if foreign intervention succeeds in removing despots, the lack of foreign authority or even political will paves the path for a power vacuum that may lead to long-term instability. This was the case in Libya, following the removal of Gadaffi from power and in Egypt with Mubarak - other countries carry little legitimacy and political will to follow through with the implementation of necessary democratic institutions, leaving a once hostile region up for grabs. This resulted in a military junta in Egypt and a civil war in Libya, further achieving results contrary to the professed objective of military intervention that was liberation from the shackles of oppression. To further this argument on why intervention is indefensible even when intervention is successful, the law of unintended consequences negates any past benefits of intervention through the emergence of dire consequences in the future. In the case of Afghanistan, CIA Operation Cyclone that trained the Mujahideen to fight oppressive forces failed miserably when it birthed the depraved terror network we know as Al Qaeda today. Likewise in South Sudan, the implementation of a Dinka-led Transitional Government of National Unity led to animosity between Dinka and Neuer ethnicities, leading to massacres along ethnic lines ongoing today. These reasons illustrate that foreign intervention cannot be justified as they worsen the lives of the very people they aim to improve in more ways than one.\nAdditionally, economic intervention whether direct or through media such as the World Bank debilitate the very economies they aspire to serve, making them largely unjustifiable. Prima facie, economic intervention in developing countries injects much needed financial capital to nurture them, thus seeming justifiable. However, this naive notion is flawed on multiple levels. First, it must be noted that economic intervention almost exclusively comes with strings attached. This can be seen in how the World Bank's attempts to intervene in African nations in the 1990s through micro finance programmes have largely failed to achieve success. To the contrary, they have crippled these economies by eliciting in debt collections over twenty billion USD per anum. Similarly, Greece was crippled by punitive sovereign debt that deprived its central bank and government the ability to flex its fiscal muscle, precluding its ability to exercise fiscal autonomy. This was because other countries had the contractual upper hand in demanding for their money back. Second, even when intervention itself comes with no strings attached, countries subject themselves to the diplomatic whims and fancies of the interventionists, hence mortgaging future economic growth for short lived boosts in economic performance. Angola watched itself give up sixty percent of oil assets to Chinese multinationals following their intervention in the Angolan economy whereas Yemen watched its economy crumble at the hands of the United States that suspended all USAID intervention programmes on the eve of the first Gulf War when the Yemeni ambassador voted against a United States resolution advocating for military intervention in Iraq in the Security Council. Third, ignorance of the intervening countries may inadvertently debilitate the economies they intervene in, even in the rare instances where there are few or no strings attached. What seemed like benevolent assistance, US intervention in the Guyana economy crippled it when US products displaced the local market mechanism by introducing superior but cheaper US products, thereby driving local Guyanese products out of the market, and forcing local producers to poverty. Such was also the case in Mozambique. What is known to economists as the 'Dutch Disease Effect' further erodes the competitiveness of countries intervened in, crippling them in the long run. This highlights how economic intervention, due to its nature of conditionality, its potential for diplomatic leverage, and the ignorance of the intervening party largely debilitates the economies they seek to nurture, rendering them indefensible.\n Lastly, intervention of any form on the supranational level where countries, under set international framework, intervene in others with or without consent cannot be condoned due to its lack of accountability and its entrapment in rigid bureaucracy maligned by political self interest. Such factors have been noted to deteriorate the very conditions intervention may seek to address. Lack of oversight in organisations with the authority to intervene, like the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has ironically led to war crimes in conflicts they were mobilised to dissipate. Cases of UN Peacekeeper brutality and even the rape of uninvolved civilians by parties in such a position of trust, a gross abrogation of the commitments undertaken to International Humanitarian Law under the Geneva Conventions, is not unheard of. This form of coalition intervention dramatically reduces the ability to effect necessary oversight as it makes the apportioning of blame and the application of punitive measures to any one party overtly difficult. This can serve to exacerbate already tense situations, as was the case with UN intervention in East Timor. Furthermore, supranational intervention of any one or few countries into another under international framework inspires a false sense of confidence in the international community of the ability of said intervention to be effective. As evidenced by various instances of political gridlock due to competing objectives and self-interest, such faith is misplaced. It both deters other forms of effective conflict resolution and itself fails to achieve any results compounding the issues faced in the country needing intervention. Such was the case in Rwanda where neighbouring Uganda decided not to intervene despite repeated calls by the incumbent government as the UN Mission in Rwanda had already been deployed. However, when the world needed it, political gridlock in the Security Council precluded the authorisation for troops already stationed in Rwanda to mobilise and act; Peacekeepers had to helplessly watch as Hutu turned on Tutsi and slaughtered one another on the bloodied streets of Kigali. This serves to show that supranational intervention both lacks much needed oversight and is subjected to bureaucratic inefficiency amidst political self-interest. It is thus that intervention is unjustifiable - far from solving the problems of other countries, it either directly contributes to them or otherwise deters the implementation of effective solutions, while itself being ineffectual.\nIn conclusion, foreign intervention of most forms, except for humanitarian responses to disasters, compounds the very problems they seek to resolve and thus cannot be justified on both principle and practical grounds. This then begs the question - why does intervention continue to exist today, and how else can the international community respond? To address the former, experts in the field of international relations posit that it is but a way to consolidate political clout, present themselves as bastions of ideals such as democracy, and for large powers to satiate their modern day \"white saviour complex\", thereby pinning motivations behind intervention on self interest, as opposed to altruism. To address the later, perhaps there is no ideal way to resolve issues in the hotchpotch of international relations - for saying that intervention is unjustifiable is not to say other methods of conflict resolution and nation building are more effective. Perhaps this conundrum is best summarised by the sagacious words of Friedrich Nietschze who mused on the idea of moral relativism. He opined that to any problem - \"There is your way, and there is mine. As for the right way, it does not exist.\""

                "prompt": "Should a good government always protect the interests of the majority?",
                "text": "The morality and efficacy of the majority rule has been debated from times immemorial, and opinions on the matter presently remain empirically polarised. Proponents of giving paramount importance to majority interests adopt a utilitarian argument and point out that such has become the internationally accepted way of good democratic governance, while naysayers highlight both the flaws in principle and practice that result in the detriments of such governance. I personally reject the preposterous postulation that a good government should always protect the interests of the majority before all else because this naive notion paves the way for gross violations of human rights and customary international law, hinges upon a flawed assumption of a qualified majority, and results in detriments to both the majority and the minority in the long run.\nDetractors may argue, however, that the indiscriminate protection of majority interests is sound both in principle and practice. In principle, such thinking is congruent with accepted political theories on governance and ensures that the government best fulfills its obligations under the social contract through a utilitarian approach. In 'The Prince', Niccolo Machiavelli's magus opus, it is argued that an immoral means is justified by a moral end, suggesting that the government is expected to work  towards the greater good, even if such policymaking infringes on the rights of and compromises on the interests of the minority. The manifestation of such a belief is seen predominantly in representative democracies such as Switzerland, where policies are implemented so long as a 50% majority vote is reached. This has gone to take form even in supranational organisations like the United Nations Security Council where States are permitted to infringe on the sovereignty of minority voters through economic sanctions, arms embargoes and even direct military intervention, should a supermajority of 67% be reached, clearly against the interests of the minority. In practice, following the majority rule will not gravely jeopardise the interests of any one group, because most majority-minority dichotomies exist in equilibria such that a member of the minority in one aspect (say on opinions on abortion laws) would constitute the majority group on another (say on opinions on gun laws). This liquidity of the majority justifies universally abiding by majority beliefs as opined by John Locke, in his Second Treatise on government, who suggests that it is only right for minority groups to accept such a majority rule in the interest of the common good, which they too will benefit from. John Stuart Mill too argues that such should be the true way of governance for it maximises happiness and minimises suffering in his theory on utilitarianism. Thus, this appears to be both valid in principle and in practice.\nHowever, the aforementioned argument must be challenged, for it rests on a flawed premise that the majority-minority division is liquid. In reality, there exist permanent minorities who suffer from the tyranny of the majority, both in terms of unlawful abrogations of international law and gross human right violations. While it is true that liquid minorities exist in largely homogenous societies, we only have to turn to nations in which ethnic minorities are persecuted by the state to have a glimpse of geopolitical realities. The majority rule has led to mass atrocities globally: in Rwanda where state sanctioned genocides took place between ethnic Hutus and Tutsis, in Bosnia where Serbs massacred Muslims, in South Sudan where loyalists of President Salva Kiir (of Dinka ethnicity) murdered members of Riek Machar's fellow Neurs, inter alia. Even today, Myanmar's state sanctioned hostility, which arguably is in line with majority interests, is driving out Muslim Rohingyas on dinky boats into dangerous open seas, sparking a refugee crisis whereas Shia favourite Bashar Al-Assad is considered a war criminal for his use of chemical weapons on civilians. Such a list is endless. It only serves to show that the notion of a majority rule only works if a government ensures that human rights (such as \"life, liberty and security of person\" detailed in Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights) and international law (such as those pertaining to the attack of civilians detailed in the various Geneva Conventions) are not compromised for the sake of the majority. Only such a government that protects the inalienable rights of all human beings in addition to serving the interests of the majority can be considered a \"good government\" by any sense of the phrase.\nIn addition, the unequivocal pursuit of the wish of the majority rests on another assumption that the majority is qualified to make decisions for the country as a whole. In a time when Thailand, Indonesia and various other countries have ongoing petitions and campaigns aiming to prevent uneducated voters from exercising suffrage and participating in legislative referendums, such an assumption needs to be questioned. The majority may be unqualified to make decisions for three reasons. Majority decisions tend to be uninformed, driven by self-interest, contrary to the beliefs of John Locke, and succumb to populist pressure at the cost of effectiveness. Plato argues in 'The Republic' that it should be the captain who steers the ship, not the passengers, suggesting that it is unwise to let an educated majority decide on matters they have little experience in. This is especially true in countries like Thailand and DR Congo where the phenomenon of \"vote buying\" - a process in which votes for political candidates are secured by giving monetary incentives to those who are uneducated and in penury - is prevalent. This not only maligns the core principle of good democratic governance that rests on an educated and informed electorate, but also mars the value of the equality of representation by making political decisions a prerogative of the rich. Second, relying on the majority rule could lead to ineffective populist policies that hurt the growth of a nation. This can be demonstrated by a comparative analysis of two countries during the later decades of the previous century - India that depended on populist social welfare policies under the rule of the Gandhis and the Congress Party, and Mao's unpopular decisions (such as the heavy emphasis on capital good production, the one child policy, etc) in China. As a result, India continues to remain in the backwaters of economic success whereas China has succeeded in raising the mean standard of living for its citizens tremendously as reflected in the growth of its Human Development Index. Third, the majority tends to vote keeping personal interests, as opposed to the interests of the nation, in mind. This is evidenced by Donald Trump's win in the primaries and caucuses in Nevada and New Hampshire, among others, despite the fact that his xenophobic closed doors approach towards immigrants contradicts over fifty years of American immigration and foreign policy, once again out of self interest. Hence, the decisions of the majority should be viewed with suspicion and over-ridden by a \"good government\", if necessary.\nNext, the unequivocal support of the majority rule could disrupt the delicate fabric of international relations, resulting in complications and detriments for citizens nationwide. Take the case of the Russian annexation of Crimea, sovereign Ukrainian territory, simply because (as Russia puts it) 96% of Crimeans voted in favour of Russian unification in a national referendum. This unilateral action failed to consider that perhaps the argument of protecting majority interests cannot be used to justify the violation of agreements on the international level and infringe on border protocol. This annexation, clearly 'out-of-order', inspired the West to impose crippling sanctions on Russia, even on basic necessities like food, ultimately debilitating the Russian economy and causing great hostility between international superpowers, seen in Obama and Putin's bickering in the General Assembly. This led to unwarranted consequences not only for the citizens of Russia, but also those of other countries; gridlocks in the Security Council ostensibly led to the aggravation of the Syrian Civil war, owing to inaction by the international community. Blindly following the majority has the potential to antagonise members of the international community and hurt uninvolved parties. Any good government would thus not stand for such acts, in accordance with the \"Responsibility to Protect\" (R2P).\nLastly, the pursuit of majority-favouring policies may be detrimental to the society in the long run as they do not solve the problems faced by the majority at their roots. Policies of affirmative action, such as the New Economic Policy in Malaysia, under the Bumiputera ('sons of the soil') umbrella, has received much criticism for some say it only exacerbates the dire problem of economic growth. This is because it secures the interest of an ethnic majority, by paying the cost of future growth borne by all. Similarly, analysts in the United States have concluded that the affirmative action policies of the past decades in the field of education, such as lowering the barriers for women to get into colleges, have failed because the problem has simply reversed itself in the present day. Today, it is men who suffer from a disappointing 46% admission rate (compared to the 54% for women), suggesting that the problem continues to exist, if not exacerbated, just with a different demographic. Such policies that favour a majority laggard group are not only discriminatory and counterproductive to larger objectives of a nation, but also ineffective as they do little but change the demographic of the victims of unequal opportunity. By no metric can such policies symbolise good governance.\nIn conclusion, while putting the interests of the majority first is acceptable in principle, it paves the way for harmful political decisions that hurt the interests of all. A \"good government\" should not resort to blindly adopting such measures, but rather should implement checks and balances to prevent the tyranny of the majority constitutionally, committing to protecting human rights and act in accordance with international law. Only then can a government that protects the interests of the majority over those of the minority be considered a \"good government\"."

                "prompt": "“Education should be the first concern of any government.” Do you agree?",
                "text": "There is a Chinese saying “Children are the country’s cornerstone.” No matter how much a country is blessed with natural resources, its population is the ultimate force behind any economic achievement. For e tries like China and India which have plentiful amounts of natural resources to tap, their people are still much needed to use these resources to generate the growth of the economy. For countries such as Singapore and Japan which have practically no natural resources, their people are the only resource. Hence, we can see that the population is the most valuable asset of a country and I feel that a government should ensure that its people are well-educated for the benefits of economic growth.\nI agree with the view that education should be the primary concern of any government. However, not all countries around the world adopt this view. Some think that defence should be their first priority, others choose healthcare, crime control and technological improvement. Take India for example. She is the second most populous country in the world and experiencing a population boom, especially in the countryside where birth control is not common. The country devotes a great deal of attention to defence and military spending. This is not surprising since India and her neighbour, Pakistan, for years have been caught in a circle of animosity and distrust; they have fought several wars. However, I feel that the emphasis on defence is at the expense of the people’s edu cation. India is basically still an agrarian economy. Many rural children do not have the opportunity to go to school due to the lack of educational facilities in the country side where communications and infrastructure are poor. This problem is aggravated by poverty. Even if there were schools available, most children would still not stand a chance of obtaining an education as they are simply too poor to afford it. Besides, their parents prefer sending them to work in the fields to minimise the financial bur den. Things are not much better in the cities either. Al though the people are relatively wealthier and many can afford to send their children to schools, child labourers are an ubiquitous sight. In fact, India has one of the high est rates of child labour in the world. These children work. long hours daily for meagre wages. Their future looks bleak, since without any education they are unlikely to find a well-paid job when they grow up.\nIt has been shown that the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is spreading at a faster rate, especially in the developing countries in Africa and Asia. At the moment, no cure has been found for this disease. One of the major reasons it has infected so many people in these countries is pure ignorance. It is the rural people who are the most vulnerable to this disease since the lack of edu cation causes them to be ignorant of the ways of trans mission of AIDS. As I have mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is already hard for the rural poor to obtain a basic education about the prevention of AIDS.\nThe more developed countries definitely have a higher literacy rate than the developing ones. However, this does not mean complacency can be allowed to set in here. The government of the United States of America, for example, has realised that it is now time to do something about its educational system which is plagued with a drop in standards. Critics have condemned the system in which students are assessed using multiple choice questions which they say do not fully test the students’ abilities and intelligence.\nI see the need for governments to let education be their first concern. In the case of developing countries like India, the government should ensure that education is available and affordable for the young. They should improve the infrastructure in the rural areas so that the poor can easily reached by teachers and so schools can be built. A large pool of illiterate young people is inevitably detrimental to the economy and progress of the nation. It is also a waste of human resources. Developed nations with established educational systems should constantly seek to upgrade and improve these systems. In this way, countries will always be able to have well-educated and quality labour forces to assist in economic development and nation building."

                "prompt": "Discuss the contribution of teachers to Man.",
                "text": "Teachers can be found in every country and society. They are found in various fields, imparting skills and knowledge. widespread presence indicates their importance to mankind, for indeed, teachers contribute to the welfare of mankind in various ways.\nTeachers are important in the development of the mind. They are important in delivering knowledge in the class rooms. Facts and discoveries throughout the ages are imparted to the young and even the old, allowing the in crease of knowledge. But perhaps more importantly, the teacher provides guidance in the way to think. Classroom teaching stimulates the mind to think and develop, and the teacher plays the important role of encouragement and guidance. This is especially important for young children and teenagers who become equipped with the ability to think independently through such developments. What the teacher does for mankind is not just to impart knowledge but also to stimulate thinking so that the mind develops, and perhaps this results in the discovery of new ideas. This definitely benefits mankind and society.\n(In fact, with Google, internet, search engines and YouTube, we are capable of learning knowledge on our own. It is the thinking skills that will set us apart, namely critical thinking, creative thinking, systemic and systematic thinking!)\nTeachers prepare the young for the adult world, helping and guiding them as they grow. The ability to think independently is part of the life skills which a teacher helps a child develop. Such skills prepare the child for a time when he has to leave the protection of his parents and teachers. The young also gain the necessary knowledge for their future occupations. After all, no one is born a doctor or a lawyer. Even a teacher himself had to be taught in order to become one. Thus, in this way, EDUCATORS prepare the young for the adult world and ensure the continued survival of mankind.\nSome teachers may also guide in the development of the body. Although sports are generally regarded as an area where natural talents are inherently important, guidance is still important and here, the teacher comes in. For the development of the body and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, sport is important. Everyone needs some basic guidance in the use of various sports equipment. The health and fitness of the layman is enhanced by the guidance of teaching professionals. Even athletes and sportsmen required coaching to develop their inborn talents. In this way. teachers in the field of sports develop the body, and benefit mankind.\nAs in sports, the arts and music need a certain amount of talent. But the role of teachers, as in sports, is not only. to guide the general public towards appreciation and some basic knowledge of the arts and music, but also to help those with special talents. The naturally gifted, teaching others, can also impart their experiences and this ensures that their talents do not die with them but continue. to contribute to the welfare of mankind. Speaking from personal experience, I know that my piano instrcutor is constantly guiding and developing my musical knowledge and skills. What she provides is not just guidance but also assistance in the discovery of my capabilities. There are thousands of people in the world, benefiting from the guidance of their teachers. And considering that the in fluence of one teacher may lead to that student’s subsequent coaching and training of another person, there is no telling how far skills and knowledge can be imparted. Indeed, one is reminded of the Singapore Government slogan in the recruitment of teachers – “Teach. You never know where your influence ends.”\nIn our modern age of technology, one may find accountants and other occupations gradually being replaced by computers. But a computer can neve replace a teacher, just as a book can never equal the knowledge delivered by a living person. The teacher provides the real-life, personal touch in the communication of knowledge. Moreover, even modern ideas of technology require a teacher to impart them to the general public. Through the spread of modern technology, society develops and mankind’s welfare is again benefited.\nTeachers may also play a role in the bringing together of mankind around the world – the creation of a global village. They are necessary to increase communication between people, for example, by the teaching of various languages. Only then can mankind around the world communicate. As I mentioned before, technology is also in directly enhanced by teaching. There is no end to the benefits mankind can gain from the development of technology. Better communications enable people around the world to come together in discussions of world issues, such as the environment and peace. These definitely benefit mankind and teachers play an indirect role in bringing about these changes and developments.\nPerhaps the most widely recognised contribution of teachers to the welfare of mankind, however, remains. their influence on the young, particularly in schools. The importance of education is widely recognised. And in our modern society where working parents spend little time with their children, the contributions of teachers have gone beyond the imparting of knowledge. They now in fluence children’s characters, attitudes and ideas. In a way, teachers have in part taken over the role of the parents in the development of the young. Thus, their influence on and contribution to mankind are great. Even in developing countries, teachers play the important role of spreading new knowledge and ideas and help in the development of the nation. The contribution of teachers to man kind’s welfare cannot be denied.\nTeachers definitely play a very important role in society. Indeed, their contributions are found everywhere, for teachers influence mankind and contribute to an endless spread of influence from generation to generation. Thus, the contribution of teachers to the welfare of mankind is a never-ending and important one."

                "prompt": "Discuss the view that when Man learnt to split the atom, he opened the proverbial Pandora’s Box.",
                "text": "Legend has it that when Pandora’s Box was opened, the evils of the world, such as chaos and destruction, were released upon a relatively peaceful world. The only one. good thing that came out of Pandora’s Box was hope and so the same now goes for the splitting of the atom: a lot of trouble with only a few benefits. This brings to mind the question of why Man tried to split the atom if it meant having more problems in an already troubled world. The answer to the question lies in the fact that man did not consider the consequences of splitting the atom. The rea son behind the splitting of the atom was to produce a potent weapon that would end World War Two, a benefit to mankind then and no long-term consequences were considered when American scientists went about doing the task.\nAs mentioned above, the atom was split to produce a potent weapon and when this was achieved, it heralded the start of the development of the first atomic bomb in a project known as the Manhattan Project. After the first atomic bomb was successfully developed, two were subsequently dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, on 6th and 9th of August in 1945 respectively. The World witnessed for the first time the massive destruction. wrought by atomic bombs that flattened both cities, and the horrendous after-effects, such as a high increase in cases of cancer and deformities in babies, that lasted for many generations. As can be seen from the above case, the splitting of the atom brought massive destruction, sufferings and sorrow to mankind.\nThe irony to the whole situation in which nations have started to build more atomic bombs and developed them further into nuclear weapons after the first atomic bomb was dropped, is that instead of serving as agents of destruction, the atomic and nuclear weapons serve as messengers of peace. Scientists, after viewing the destructiveness of such weapons in testing, postulated that a nu clear war would cause such massive destruction world wide that human civilization might be set back for thou sands of years and might even signal the end of the hu man race. With such gloomy forecasts, nations now use their store of nuclear weapons as a deterrent, rather than machines of war. Hence, nuclear weapons may be seen as a means of maintaining peace and preventing wars.\nThe knowledge that nuclear weapons are the bane of the human race results in popular unrest in countries with a nuclear arsenal and whenever nuclear testings are carried out in these nations or any other countries, a major outcry can be heard coming from both the people and a whole host of nations. As such, many countries possessing nuclear arsenals have signed a pact denouncing clear testing and declaring their stand to stop all near testing in their own respective countries. However,  France broke the pact when French President Chirac announced the decision to continue nuclear testing at Muroroa Atoll in the Pacific, a decision that led to a major onslaught from the whole world, noticeably, Pacific nations such as Australia and New Zealand. The sub sequent testing led to massive riotings and demonstrations.\nAs destructive as the splitting of a mere atom may be, it presents an alternative energy source other than petroleum and coal and yields more energy than can be harvested by solar power stations using current technology. Nuclear energy is currently being promoted as it is clean and does not directly pollute the environment and is relatively problem-free. The most important thing is that a whole city can be powered by just a few grammes of raw materials, instead of tons of petroleum or coal.\nHowever, as wonderful as nuclear power may be, there lies the danger of a nuclear meltdown. Experts say chances are very small due to the high level of caution exerted, seen in the precautions taken and the highly advanced technology used in harvesting nuclear energy. Despite all this, such a disaster did take place in the Chernobyl nu clear power station in the former Soviet Union in the 1980s. One of the nuclear reactors suffered a nuclear meltdown and exploded, causing massive destruction in areas of land around the station and sending a massive radioactive dust cloud throughout mainland Europe. more recent report said that a similar disaster was also narrowly avoided on Long Island in America.\nBesides the danger of a nuclear meltdown, another problem of nuclear power is the disposal of the radioactive waste. There is no way to completely dispose of the radioactive waste except to bury them in tightly-sealed containers underground and wait for the radioactivity of these materials to disappear, a process that normally takes thousands of years. Two dangers lie in this procedure. One is the threat of leakage and two, terrorists can easily steal the nuclear waste which are then sold away to countries as raw materials for nuclear weapons. The latter problem is currently surfacing as Russian mafia members are reportedly selling nuclear waste stolen from Ukraine to countries developing a nuclear arsenal. Another problem is the indiscriminate disposal of the nuclear waste. This problem was seen recently in a playground in Britain where radioactive materials were allegedly buried under it.\n20 Though it may seem that for every benefit brought by the splitting of the atom, there are many problems, there is one area where there are only benefits; the medical field. Radiation is used in radiotherapy used to treat cancer. X rays are also fully utilized by the medical field in diagnosis. As can be seen, this is one area where the splitting of the atom solely benefits man.\nAll in all, what is done has been done. The atom has been split by Man and there is no going back to what had been before. What can be done now is to ensure that no new problems will arise and the existing ones kept to a minimum. It is heartening to see Man using the problems to their advantage as in the case of nuclear weapons as deterrents, and much more can be done. Indeed, it is no time for Man to cry over spilt milk, as Pandora did after she opened the box, but to try to eradicate the problem caused by Man himself."

                "prompt": "“Computer games have great appeal but little value.” Discuss.",
                "text": "What nonsense! Nothing can be further from the truth. According to a survey in the New Paper in 1995, 70% of teenagers interviewed listed computer games as one of the ten greatest inventions in the world, alongside with the telephone, steam engine, wheel, etc. This does not merely show the popularity and prevalence of computer games, but also show that they are highly valued.\nIt is impossible to justify how it can ever be that computer games have little value. Some people argue that a person may derive hours of satisfaction from interacting with computer games but does zero productive work. Therefore it is of no value. That line of argument is very questionable. Just how is value measured? If no money is made from doing that, then is that activity of no value? Do we not, following this line of thought, consider music and art to be worthless activities too? Pleasurable hours may be spent listening to music, or composing or playing them, but it will all add up to little productive output. A great many may think that music and art do add up to a lot of value (by looking at the number of famous artists and musicians and the amount they earn). Well, look at computer games then. Its annual sales can out-rival even music.\nDrawing an analogy to art again, computer games, like art, does not always offer tangible, seeable results. That does not mean that art is of little value. Computer games. like art, are recreational activities that develop the mind. In fact, computer games are more than an art. It is the fusing of art and technology into a cohesive unit, blending the creativity, abstractness of art with the razor-sharp precision and reality of technology. Therefore, computer games should be termed ‘techno art’. It is no wonder that the world embraces it with open arms.\nNo one will doubt that creativity and thinking skills are valuable skills. Yet some doubt the ability of computer games in imparting these values. A computer game needs tremendous creativity and wisdom in governing a simulated city, to make the economy boom, to fight the rising crime rate, all the fun without the fuss of being a real governor, who faces stress and criticisms. He can also fight wars with China, Iraq or America as the president of Singapore, while leading troops to colonize Mars and the moon. Doing all this in the comfort of his arm chair, free of pressure, he can fully utilize his creativity. and act out his fantasies. The real world cannot provide. this route of escape. Some men, being unable to accept the roles they were playing, simply imposed their fantasies on all other people, resulting in wars, bloodshed, unrest. The enlightened man who becomes a computer gamer also finds that he can finally sit in the cockpit of an F-16 fighter soaring through the sky. On his way to becoming a good pilot, he will boost his level of eye hand coordination and fast reflexes, all of this found in sports, In fact, critics of these fast and furious fighting games should have a go at it, so that they can realise their inferior skills which cause their characters’ noses to be all bloodied. The skills learned from playing computer games are akin to the precision needed in basketball and the fast reflexes needed in badminton.\nSchools use computer increasingly nowadays to teach the students in a fun way. They have mathematic pro grams where the player has to calculate sums to save the princess, programs where touching a click will allow the player to know more about certain things. Now, if these programs are not called computer games, no one knows what to call them.\nNot only so, computer games are the connection be tween the advanced technology of computer and the entertaining purposes of audio and video equipment. If the computer is not used for fun, why bother with developing greater graphics (more pixels, resolution, etc.)? There fore, because of computer games, all these similar developments can merge. That accounts for the spurt in audio video-computer technology growth in the past decade. As an industry itself, computer games generated billions of dollars in turn-over, so it has a certain monetary value: too. Just look at the number of people owning some sort of computer games.\nA point to note is that too much of anything is never good, not even water. A person who drinks too much water can actually die. A game player who plays too much will become addicted and suffer deterioration in schoolwork, career, or relations with people. It is important to note that the self control of that person, not the game, is at fault.\nComputer games. Love it or hate it, but those who know better, play it, and benefit from it. Computer games have value like art and music and should not be thought of as useless junk. At the same time, computer games never set out to dominate lives, but are just a companion (again, much like art and music) in the path of life."

                "prompt": "Computers are indispensable in modern life. How far do you agree?",
                "text": "For the past few decades, computers have become increasingly important. Previously, they were gigantic machines which performed limited tasks. Now, their uses are varied. Modern life is increasingly linked to these machines.\nThe computer plays a very important role in the business world. In financial institutions such as stock ex changes, dealers can hardly do without it. Information from banks and stock markets can be transmitted around the world within a fraction of a second. Dealers and brokers are thus fully aware of the actions of their counter parts in different countries. Information with all the de tails is presented on computer screens and decisions can be made directly. Without such linkages through com trading would stagnate. This would affect capital markets and would have adverse effects on national economies.\nIn other aspects of business communications, computers are also vital. A multinational company can only be properly managed provided the work done by the different branches around the world does not conflict. Again, it is the speed of computers that helps. This ensures in formation that is communicated from one place to an other is not outdated. Moreover, the huge storage space of computers partly eliminates the need for heavy files. Information that is typed on paper can last as long as the paper. However, information stored in computers is more durable as computers do not deteriorate as fast as plain paper.\nMeanwhile, government institutions have improved their efficiency tremendously through the use of computers. Once again, the larger storage space gives computer disks an enormous advantage over paper. In Singapore, the National Libraries and the Housing and Development Board can now retrieve and process information at the press of a button. Queries have been reduced as a result. Without such technological advances, the usual complaints would emerge again. These include the wastage of time in searching for files and a huge amount of paperwork. In modern society, a faster pace of work is essential so as to ensure high productivity.\nThe use of computers has also abolished the necessity of using workers to do dull and monotonous tasks such as the assembling of manufactured goods, and low level clerical work. This has raised productivity and profits since computer-controlled robots can work at the same pace day and night. However, this is also a major cause of the rising unemployment levels in most developed countries.\nAlthough computers are important, it may not be true to say that modern life cannot function properly without computers. Firstly, for instance, computer games are very popular nowadays but do not always have to be part and parcel of life. More healthy forms of recreations such as sports can replace computer games.\nMoreover, although computers can improve communications there are also limitations, as computers lack the human touch. Although people can receive information through bulletin boards merely by sitting in front of a personal computer, each user will not be able to under stand the feelings of the other party since there are no face-to-face meetings. In the business world, meeting people is still very important as views and ideas can be transmitted in a more personal manner. The computer is only used when long distances hamper communications.\nEven in entertainment, where computers have created stunning multimedia effects (especially in animated movies), the skills of humanity are still needed. The better quality movies are created not by computers but through the hard work of the directors, actors and technical staff. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, robots and computers are only the tools of people. Research and development in design and product improvement come out of the minds of the individual designers. Moreover, creative products (such as jewellery) can never be manufactured through the use of computers since a unique identity is needed for each product.\nIn the field of police work, no one can deny the use fulness of computers in identifying fingerprints. Nevertheless, the work of experienced detectives in trying to understand motives and behaviour is most vital. In court, the essential task of convicting criminals still depends on the mind of a human judge.\nIn conclusion, it has to be emphasized that computers were invented by humans to perform certain tasks that humans have difficulty in doing. The decision-making and thinking processes can never be replaced by the computer as it cannot formulate its own opinion. Therefore, although the computer has contributed much to the progress of human society, people are still the ones in charge. The computer is a tool of a person and he may be able to do without it."

                "prompt": "“The most perfect language of humans is Mathematics.” Do you agree?",
                "text": "For as long as the human race has existed, we have been communicating with each other using various languages (including sign and body languages). Over millennia, the variety and complexity of our languages have grown extremely vast. With the growth of our knowledge, we have developed, or rather, discovered a totally new language, Mathematics. Is it the most perfect language of all? With our limited understanding of it, I would venture to say that it is only perfect for certain purposes.\nTo start off, what makes a language a language? It is something spoken, unspoken or written, which is used for communication between two or more individuals. Conventionally, human languages make use of symbols. which represent sounds, which in turn represent objects, ideas and emotions: a most inefficient and antiquated anachronism, as a mathematician would claim. But wait, what about mathematics? It too, makes use of symbols to represent things, anything that conventional languages can represent. The beauty of mathematics lies in the fact that it is not us, fallible humans, that created it. It was there since the beginning of the existence of our universe, when ever that was. It is the language of Nature and the rhythm of the stars. We merely discovered it, and will continue to learn about it for a long, long time to come. Therein lies its limitations as far as our usage of it is concerned, for the scope of our understanding is narrow.\nAny thought, idea, word, anything used in communication can be reduced to a series of binary impulses: on, off; off, on and so on. This is the language of the computers we have developed. It is also the language that the individual cells in our brain use to communicate with each other. It is extremely simple, fast and efficient. It is also free from bias and racial and emotional baggage. Some people have said that if we all speak the language of mathematics, then we would be in harmony with the universe and at peace with ourselves. Mathematics is also extremely precise and free from all the silly little idiosyncrasies of the other human language. There is no ‘maybe’ or ‘sometime later’ but ‘a probability of 62%’ and ‘2 minutes and 51.3 seconds in the future. There is a well-known poem entitled ‘English is a funny language”, and how true it is! A person would ‘tic-up’ something, but is ‘tied down’ with commitments. In sending instructions to a satellite, we do not tell it to “move a little to your right…. a bit more…. there, stop!” but “fire directional thrusters on port side for 3 seconds, rotate 60° clockwise.” My point is that mathematics as a language reduces greatly the chance for miscommunication, mis understanding, and foolish errors. When scientists sent the Voyager spacecraft to the stars, they included a plaque inscribed with mathematical formulae which could be de ciphered by aliens, if there are any, telling them who we are, how we live, our genetic makeup and our peaceful intentions. Mathematics is the great common language that everyone can make use of to communicate.\nHowever, we must take a look at ourselves before rushing out to propagate the binary gospel. Our brains function and work in a very different way from computers. Our brains process information simultaneously and in a parallel fashion, and when we think, we muddle along, groping around the edges of what we think we want, our neuron synapses firing furiously, and suddenly, voila! We hit upon an idea. This is what makes us capable of creative thought. Computers, however, pass information through a series of logic gates, filtering out what is not needed, before drawing on databanks to form a conclusion. We are also unable to communicate using numbers verbally. The whole structure of society would be upended if we did so. We are not able to communicate at the speed of our brain cells or computers, and as many ideas, when reduced to a string of numbers, would be extremely long, communication would get even more inefficient. Thus, we are not physically and mentally able to communicate directly in numbers.\nWe must therefore, use the right combination of phonetic and numerical languages to communicate. Mathematics is only perfect for usage in technological purposes, in our communication with machines."

                "prompt": "How successful is your country in tackling significant issues facing her today?",
                "text": "Singapore has progressed remarkably from Third World to First World over a short span of 39 years since independence. Perhaps what has spearheaded the growth of this once thriving fishing village to the bustling, cosmopolitan city of today was the foresight of shrewd leaders such as Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Keng Swee and the unity of Singaporeans. Obviously, as Singapore enters the 21st century, she faces many political, economic and social issues, which have been successfully tackled to a certain extent, and needs to fully overcome them in order to remain as one of the tigers of South East Asia.\nOn the economic aspect, Singapore faces a dearth of babies, a trend common in developed countries. such as Japan and Italy. In fact, Singapore’s birth rate was at an all-time low in 2003 and hastened the government’s procreation policies. Babies are crucial for Singapore, as they are the future of our workforce and sustain Singapore’s population rate. With fewer babies born, Singapore faces an ageing population and a larger burden on current taxpayers to provide for the elder y’s increasing need for healthcare benefits and housing. Indeed, Singapore has tried to tackle this problem by her “Baby Bonus schemes, where couples who bear children receive. monetary incentives, extending maternity leave to a maximum of six months for civil servants and even a “Romancing Singapore” campaign to encourage couples to procreate: However, while the government’s initiatives are commendable, they have been unsuccessful, as couples attest to having children as a personal decision and lifelong commitment, where monetary aid is useful, albeit temporary. Indeed, the hectic pace of working life in Singapore has forced many couples to abandon plans for children. Perhaps the government is only curing the symptoms of the problem but not getting to the root of it, as shown by surveys which explain couples wish for a five-day working week and hence less stress, which may encourage them to have children. Perhaps, though, the government should stop using a one-size-fits-all panacea method but actively seek the views of couples.\nAnother issue is globalisation, or specifically maintaining the Singapore edge, Currently, outsourcing of jobs to China and India, the outsourcing giants of manufacturing and services respectively, has caused many Multi-National Companies (MNCs) to relocate their bases from Singapore. Further, ports such as PTP in neighbouring Johor threaten the survival of Singapore’s PSA, which is a cornerstone of our economy. While the phenomenon has been condemned by US politicians, pond who blame outsourcing for major unemployment of both blue and white-collar workers, Singapore has tried a win win approach and encouraged her citizens to ride on China and growth and create our niche areas, India’s growth such as in biotechnology. Indeed, Singapore has devoted millions to building up One North, the life sciences hub, where major research and main development on developing cures for diseases, such as SARS which paralysed Singapore in 2003 and pushing the frontiers of science. Hence, the government has been very successful in acknowledging the issue, identifying key areas for Singapore’s future growth and taking immediate action on developing Singapore in other areas which are not threatened by outsourcing or such problems.\nOn the political aspect, Singapore is revamping its image as a nanny state. The ban on chewing gum has been lifted (partially to allow nicotine chewing gum to cure addiction to smoking), bohemia is encouraged with certain towns like Holland Village being promoted as a hotbed for creativity and a speaker’s corner created in Hong Lim Park, modelled after Hyde Park in London. Even the new “Uniquely Singapore tourism campaign features bar top dancing (once banned in clubs) as the norm. While Singapore tries to create a less uptight international image, its efforts have been successful in the national media still only to a certain extent as these seem to be mere the international cosmetic changes since the inter criticizes Singapore as being a democratic socialist state since we have a lack of opposition in the government and pervasive government control in almost all aspects of citizens’ life. Maybe the peace and security we enjoy do come at a price and Singaporeans have not voiced outrage, even with the presence of Feedback Units to gather opinion on issues.\nMoreover, in the social area of the education system, while Singapore shines in international competitions in Mathematics and the Sciences, the education system has been criticized as rigid, with much emphasis on rote-learning, stifling creativity and creating stress which has led to several teen suicide cases. Indeed, the Singapore government has implemented overwhelming changes recently to address the issue, such as giving more autonomy to local universities for student admissions such as taking into account leadership qualities and coming development, creating a school in the arts such as the Julliard School in New York and starting a sports school. Thus, Singapore has been successful to a small extent in tackling this problem which had caused the brain drain of many talented students who could not cope with the education system and went overseas. Hence, while the measures implemented now. recognize the diverse abilities of students, they may have been too late, since much criticism about the education system has been made in the daily newspapers and parliamentary debates, but taking action only now, while worthy of credit, has been at the expense of many students before who struggled and eventually gave up on the system.\nFurther, another social issue is finding the threads that bind Singapore or enhancing the Singaporean identity. PM Goh Chok Tong made his famous “stayers or quitters” speech a few years back, which highlighted the vast number of Singaporeans relinquishing their citizenship and choosing to live abroad permanently. The government has been successful to a small extent in curbing this ill trend by using didactic methods such as national education in schools, ministers encouraging Singaporeans to be nationalistic and holding a massive National Day Parade annually. Singapore was built on the shoulders of immigrants and we are still a young country, hence, nurturing the Singapore identity needs time and less pressure from the government. Nationalism comes naturally, but perhaps more in a crisis, such as the Americans united as one in the aftermath of September 11 and Singaporeans during the SARS crisis and the latest being the crisis of Covid-19. Thus, subtle messages by the government may be useful.\nOverall, Singapore has been fairly successful in tackling significant issues facing her today. Much credit is due for Singapore is such a young country and yet has come so far. Still, Singapore has risen to challenges due to her government willing to bite the bullet and overcome each problem with the well being of citizens in mind."

                "prompt": "To what extent has increasing material affluence affected life in your country?",
                "text": "The increasing material affluence in Singapore has affected the citizens’ lives to a great extent. Not only has it affected the prices of goods but the values of the people as well.\nWith more income to spend, the people now have a greater demand for luxury items such as handphones and fancy sports cars. In fact, goods which were once viewed as pricey are now considered ‘reasonable to the average individual. With increasing material affluence, the people’s view of what is expensive has changed.\nNow, Singaporeans are more knowledgeable about fine-dining, imported wines and so on. Gourmet restaurants have sprung up over the last few years in response to the people’s desire to indulge in expensive fare. Thus, increasing material wealth has created a veneer of sophistication in the country.\nHowever, the increased spending of the people has caused the prices of goods to go up. Basic amenities such as water and electricity have increased in costs. Property prices have soared as well.\nThe values of the younger generation which was brought up during this period of economic boom differ from those of their predecessors. In the past, people went to school to receive education so that they could get a good job and live comfortably. Now, students would try to chase degree after degree, in order to ‘beat’ their fellow counterparts. Their acquisition of a degree is not fuelled by their thirst for knowledge. Rather, the degree is their ticket to material success. Even though this was not uncommon in the past, it has become the norm rather than the exception.\nIncreased material affluence has also changed the people’s activities in the country. Instead of spending the weekend at the seaside or cycling in the neighbourhood park, people now love to go shopping as they have the means to do so. This is evident in the nickname tourists. have bestowed on Singapore – The Shopper’s Paradise’. Indeed, spending money has become a national pastime.\nAs the increased material affluence increases the price of living in the country, people have to work doubly hard in order to maintain their standard of living. This, they do so most willingly, with plenty of executives working overtime, but often to their families’ disadvantage. With less time spent at home, parents often neglect their children in their effort to give them what they themselves perceive as the good life. The family unit begins to break up and traditional values such as ‘family togetherness’ have started to erode. The parents and their children lead totally different lives with little time for interaction with each other. This problem has become significant enough for the government to embark on a ‘family togetherness’ campaign in order to strengthen family ties.\nFurthermore, with increased material affluence, there is a greater exposure to pornography, drugs and other harmful influences. Surfing the Net will reveal many sexually explicit pictures. All these negative influences have caused a significant number of people to commit crimes such as drug trafficking. Although the harm so far caused by these negative influences is slight (crime rates in Singapore have not increased much), the legitimate anxiety is not.\nIn conclusion, increasing material affluence has greatly affected our life to the extent of increasing the standard of living, changing social values and influencing our behaviour."

                "prompt": "Choose any period in the history of your country. Why does it appeal to you?",
                "text": "From 1819 to 1824, numerous major changes took place in Singapore, then known as Temasek. These changes helped transform a small Malay fishing village into a prosperous, thriving nation and hence this is the period in the history of my country that appeals to me most.\nRaffles landed in Singapore on January 28, 1819. He was then in charge of finding a third trading port in the Malayan Archipelago for the British East India Company. Raffles found that with Singapore’s strategic geographical location and naturally deep, sheltered harbour, Singapore had great potential for becoming a renowned trading port. And it was the foresight of this great man that turned Singapore from a swampy island with few inhabitants to a focal point of trading and telecommunications. Raffles’ treaty with the Sultan Hussein Mohamad Shah of Johore and the Temenggong of the island proved to be the turning point of Singapore’s social and economic history.\nIt really seems a miracle how a backward island can undergo the same process as a caterpillar, to climb out of its cocoon transformed into a beautiful creature, resembling nothing like what it was before. This is what appeals to me. Before Raffles set foot on Singapore, there were only a few Orang Lauts living on the deserted is land. But after the treaty was signed, the population in Singapore rose rapidly, from a mere 5000 in 1821 to 11,000 by 1824. Meanwhile, Singapore’s port continued to thrive and businessmen and merchants from China, Europe and India came to set up businesses and trade. In 1821, the trading value of goods was ($8 million) which was very impressive for such a young trading port. This period shows us how Singapore went against the odds and grew into a prosperous country.\nAnother appealing factor of this period is the meticulous planning of Raffles for the settlement. It really seems amazing how he managed to gain control of the scattered population by setting up a proper plan for the settlement. In 1822, the whole population was living in houses scattered all over the island. Raffles knew that this could develop into a major problem if left unchecked and thus told the Town Committee that “the proper allotment of the native divisions of the town” was necessary. He set about building parallel roads which were lined with properly numbered houses. Different dialect groups were al located to different “kampongs”. For example, the Hokkiens, merchants and carpenters went to live at Amoy and Telok Ayer Streets while the Cantonese, tailors and goldsmiths, lived at Temple, Pagoda and Mosque Streets. This meticulous planning of Raffles helped our leaders to recognise the importance of planning and organising for the population and hence explains the orderly housing estates in Singapore now.\nThe final appealing factor of this period is the fact that this was the time when most of our ancestors from China, Thailand and India migrated to Singapore in search of better-paid jobs. They, being the pioneers of Singapore, worked and slogged all day for a better living. With out them, we would not be what we are today. Our ancestors encountered all sorts of hardships and built our nation from scratch. Every inch of our land is the fruit of their labour and much sweat and blood of theirs have been sacrificed for us. All these serve as a motivation for us that anything is possible and every goal is attainable as long as we are willing to work hard for it. Their hard work has given us a good head-start in growing to be a thriving nation.\nAll the above reasons explain why this period of history appeals to me. Singapore would probably have remained an unknown island if not for that fateful day when Raffles set foot here. It was destined that the Lion City was to be awakened on January 28, 1819."

                "prompt": "The world is fast becoming a global village. Assess the impact of this on Singapore.",
                "text": "The Singapore economy has been transformed by massive influxes of foreign investment capital. Multinationals have provided jobs on a very large scale. Singapore, using the technology that makes for a global village, has been able to set up a stock market and a monetary exchange (SIMEX). Such institutions provide opportunities for Singaporeans which can be lucrative.\nThe global village makes for stiff competition how ever. Many countries and regions now compete more intensively for investment dollars. Currently, therefore, there is an emphasis here on upgrading of infrastructure to ensure she competes for the HQs of the MNCs and the improvement of workers’ skills to head off possibilities of unemployment in the future. Such stiff competition can make people feel that the quality of life to be had in a material sense is eroded by the stresses and strains of such competition.\nOne further economic impact of being part of the global village is that Singaporeans now look and go beyond the shores of Singapore. This is part of being competitive. Apart from the regional growth triangles, Singapore companies are investing heavily in Vietnam, China and even Russia. Some countries are even adopting Singapore’s style public housing and science parks. Thus increasingly, young executives will be expected to spend time abroad or risk being passed over for promotion. Perhaps one consequence of this is that several schools in Singapore now have boarding schools.\nSingaporeans now live their lives surrounded by international products, from air-flown Australian strawberries to Swiss watches to Japanese stereos. Singapore’s buildings and transport systems are designed around the world. Moreover, when Singaporeans travel abroad, as they do extensively because of the numerous flights avail able to numerous destinations, they feel at home, with such goods and services on offer there too.\nIt is clear that economically and materially Singapore has benefited greatly from being plugged into the global village. There is a fair degree of personal affluence balanced by national, social, welfare facilities like schools and public housing. However, some people would argue that materialism is not what should lie at the heart of a society and older people worry about young people’s “I want it all, and I want it now” attitude. They feel that traditional values are under threat, particularly thrift and respect for authority. The impact of this has been to try to address the question of values in schools and in the media.\nDespite concerns about selfishness, the impact of the media has been such, that periodically Singaporeans reach out to the world in an altruistic way-e.g. sending aid to earthquake victims. On an institutional level the Singapore police have taken on peacekeeping duties in Namibia while the Singapore International Foundation sends concerned professionals on voluntary service stints to places like Nepal. Such efforts are laudable and enable Singapore to feel a certain pride in its role in the world, which goes beyond pride in economic achievement.\nLike any other country plugged into the world, Singapore has increasingly sought to make its voice heard in the international community. Professor Tommy Koh, for example, was Chairman of the Rio UN Conference on the Environment. P.M. Goh, recently, did battle in the USA over Singapore’s political system. Being part of the global village increasingly means not only a greater role but a need to assert one’s position when one comes under scrutiny.\nSingapore is a cosmopolitan society and increasing numbers of different racial groups are coming here to live and work and have fun. Tourist arrivals continue to go up and Singaporeans have benefited again in terms of jobs, but also in terms of using facilities developed to maintain tourist interest in Singapore e.g. the Night Safari. Increasingly too, foreign workers or rather, foreign talent are to be found living here. These are not just the expatriates but those who have been moved here, because they have desirable skills, with offers of P.R. status e.g. Indian computer analysts and Hong Kong media people. Thus the talent pool is expanded.\nWith increased affluence Singaporeans seek modern forms of entertainment. With improved air transport and communications, more international arts events are being seen here. At the same time this would appear to have galvanised local arts groups to be more professional, more ambitious and more competitive. As such the Arts scene is considerably more vibrant than it was when Singaporeans themselves saw their country as a “cultural desert”.\nFinally, as part of the global village, Singapore is not immune from some of its uglier aspects. Amongst these are Internet porn, the influence of international drug rings and crime syndicates (e.g. South America thieving rings)"

                "prompt": "Choose a sport and account for its popularity in your country",
                "text": "Soccer, or loosely known as football, a very popular sport in Singapore. Evidence can be found in the gate takings at the last Premier League and Malaysia Cup matches where each match raked in thousands of dollars. The National Stadium was also al most full for each match. People actually camped out side the National Stadium overnight so as to obtain tickets for the Malaysia Cup matches. For the “away” matches, many die-hard fans travelled all the way to Malaysia, fuelled by the desire to see the “Lions” win, shrugging away fatigue brought about by their jobs. These examples are evidence of the immense popularity of soccer in Singapore.\nMany reasons account for soccer’s popularity in S’pore. The mass media have a great impact and are one of the reasons why soccer is so popular in Singapore. Singaporeans have long been bombarded by English soccer, Italian soccer and even German soccer. What they want now is local soccer, soccer which they can be a part of, to which they can give their hearts and loyalty. Media like the television and radio give this opportunity. While the television brings live or delayed telecasts of matches in SG or Malaysia, the radio brings live commentaries (tune to FM 91..3). This brings the people very close to the soccer team as they can watch them. play, actually feel their determination, echo their dejected cries of defeat or savour with them the sweet taste of victory. The people thus can always be behind the team, even if they cannot make it to the stadium. Also recently, the national soccer team clinched the Malaysian Cup as well as winning the Premier League Second Division. This brought about an increasing popularity for the sport as many people who once condemned the national team as being “born losers” are now also swept by the national soccer fever. The “everyone loves a winner syndrome” now that the national soccer team has clinched both titles, has made more people interested in soccer.\nAnother reason is the rise to stardom of the local players. Superstar millionaire Fandi Ahmad has undoubtedly brought many fans to this sport. He has become an idol for many aspiring young soccer players, who strive to be like him. The soccer team has also released albums which were snapped up by the public. This increased their fame and indirectly, the interest in the game. Commercialisation may also have been the key. T-shirts and caps sup porting the team have brought the people closer to the team and to the game.\nThe government has not been idle in promoting this sport. A few years back, the Goh Chok Tong scholarship saw Nazri Nasir off to Czechoslovakia to improve his soccer. Also much attention has been paid to schools, where talented soccer players are looked for and groomed. Sometimes some of the members of the national team visit schools and teach the budding soccer players a trick or two. This is very inspiring and encouraging to the young players. The attention that the government and the Singapore Football Association now give to football boosts its popularity as the FAS publish in the newspaper their plans for the future of soccer.\nSponsorship by many sports companies like Puma, Lotto and Adidas has helped local soccer. For the local league, sponsorship is necessary for the prize money without which the teams would lack motivation. Money is also needed to hire soccer players of high calibre. As the saying goes: “If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys.” Some foreign players of high standard have been hired.\nThe Premier league and the Malaysia Cup have been run smoothly due to the efficient administration of the departments concerned. Though a few cases of corruption have been found, the games nonetheless still appeal to the people, who believe the matches are on the whole clean.\nWith such an abundance of reasons, it is no wonder that soccer is one of the most popular sports in S’pore. Government attention has helped in nurturing young talents and the mass media have helped by bringing the people closer to the soccer scene. But also in a way, soccer has been part of Singapore for a long time so the interest in the sport has just been fanned by these attempts to popularise it."

                "text": "I reside in the west of Singapore, at Tanglin Halt Road in Commonwealth. My neighbourhood is situated in be tween Holland Village and Queenstown. Flats of 10 and 14 floors dominate my neighbourhood. They were built somewhere in the late 1970’s by the Housing Development Board (HDB). I would not, however, plan the lay out of this neighbourhood differently because of several factors.\nOne of the best things about the layout of my neighbourhood is that many amenities have been carefully planned and located conveniently for the residents of Tanglin Halt. The Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) is conveniently located nearby and allows residents accessibility to town as well as other places. Many SBS bus services ply Queensway and Commonwealth Avenue, both roads practically surrounding the neighbourhood. Residents need only to walk five minutes to the bus stops. As many as 20 different bus services are available to us. The good and accessible roads also enable many taxis to ply my neighbourhood. Q: Obtaining a taxi is easy since they frequently pass through the area.\nAn essential feature included in the neighbourhood is the wet market. Housewives are able to obtain their groceries and poultry conveniently. The wet market is situated near the farther end of the neighbourhood so that its smell does not offend the residents. With the wet market and seven minimarts within the neighbourhood, we need not travel all the way to town for our necessities.\nThe Commonwealth Hawker Centre is situated in the centre of the neighbourhood with rows of shophouses surrounding it. Here we have a range of multi-racial food to tempt our taste buds and it is most convenient for a quick lunch. There are many types of stores located in the shophouses and they include the stationery shop, the bakery and provision shops. There are also the neighbourhood kindergarten and the Neighbourhood Police Post. Churches and temples can be found at the two ends of my neighbourhood. The Indians have their temple while the Christians have churches to practise their religion.\nSchools are located in nearby areas. The residents have a choice of good neighbourhood schools without the fuss of travelling too far. The HDB has also provided a com munity centre and sports complex to provide recreation for the residents. Conveniently situated in nearby Queenstown are two cinemas and a bowling centre. The residents need not go too far for recreational activities, thanks to their availability nearby. The HDB has also made provision for a library in Queenstown to satiate those with an appetite for books and for those who need a quiet place to study.\nThe layout of my neighbourhood is well-thought out and planned by the HDB. Lots of attention was paid to the convenience of the residents with the location of the many amenities in the neighbourhood. There is accessibility to many parts of the island and my neighbourhood is by no means isolated from other parts of the country. The layout of the neighbourhood is such that it is attractive and surrounded by lush greenery. There is comfort and security living in my neighbourhood. The blocks of flats are very easy to locate because of their orderly positions and large lettering which indicates the block numbers. And throughout the neighbourhood, the residents can sit in small shaded areas for an evening chat.\nIndeed, I would not plan the layout of my neighbour hood differently because I am happy living there as it is."

                "prompt": "Do books have a future?",
                "text": "In this ever changing Information Technology age when messages can be transmitted around the world in the blink of an eye, many might believe that the book would soon go the way of the dinosaur. The printed word has been with us for quite some time now and has be come an integral part of our society. I believe bound volumes of words will definitely retain their place in our lives, and though computers and similar equipment may pose a serious threat to their survival, books and their history truly do have a future still.\nMany cannot live without the book now for even though new technology can squeeze several volumes of works onto a single computer chip, the tactile relation ship between reader and book would thus be lost. Many argue that reading from a computer screen makes one’s face look like one, reading a book keeps one looking normal. Facetious as that sounds, that is just one of the many reasons people give for wanting to use books and not computer chips to gain knowledge. People still want to feel the knowledge on their hand and not just see blinking dots on a white screen. The comfortable feel of a leather bound hard-cover, the musty smell of an old volume, the texture of the paper, even the feel of a pen scratching on a rough note book are all tactile links between the person and the book, a link many are unwilling to part with, no matter the technology or convenience it could bring.\nHowever, one can argue books are wasteful things and do have numerous disadvantages that can be solved with the use of information technology. The most major problem of using books is the fact that they require huge amounts of paper, paper that has to be produced from the now. Though wood-pulp of thousands of trees that are cut down at an alarming rate for this purpose. Computer chips or com pact discs are less wasteful and taxing on the environment. Books too take up enormous amounts of space and especially in places like space-scarce Singapore, cutting down on storage spaces used for books like libraries or record offices would free much space that could be used more constructively.\nEven though costs of production of books have fallen since the early Guttenberg days, the cost of printing books as well as the cost of purchasing them for the consumer is still quite high and would constitute waste of resources that could be better used else where. Thus, books do present problems for the future and should they have a future, such difficulties will have to be addressed before they can remain a viable source of information.\nComputers and the new wave of Information Technology equipment have long threatened to spell the end of books as we know them. Innovation has enabled man to compress several huge books or records enough to fill a small room onto a disc the size of one’s palm. One is now able to access great amounts of information without ever needing to leave one’s chair, with the Internet and world webs are becoming even more popular, easy to use and well-stocked. Even the traditional text book has given way to learning through the computer with each student learning at his or her own speed behind a personalised learning terminal. The speed, convenience and space saving capabilities of computers should spell the death throes of the humble book but the computer too has its share of failings that allow the book to survive.\nHardware is expensive, as many computer enthusiasts would say, and thus replacing all books with computers and disks would be highly expensive and not feasible until Technology lowers the price further. Many poor people in Third World countries can hardly afford books, let alone computers, thus efforts should be placed to give books to such places and not seek to over modernise our already advanced world. Books remain, at the moment, the cheapest method of teaching in more backward areas of the globe and this would remain important for a long time to come. Besides, the cost of the actual machines money too has to be spent on training people to use such hardware. All this reinforces the books’ ease of use and simplicity that makes early teaching so much easier.\nThus, books do have a foreseeable future and would not be made redundant, at least not the way things are now. Though Information Technology presents us with much potential, it will be a long time before it is fully tapped and even then will not completely make the book redundant. Many say that perhaps old books have more of a future, that the old antique volumes stand a greater chance of survival as museum exhibits. That is true but I believe that books are here to stay not as relics under glass but both as a source of leisure and as efficient workhorses of the education system, the key to human intellectual development."

                "prompt": "With so many books being make into film today, is it still necessary to read?",
                "text": "Film-making is sometimes called a digital art. This has become increasingly true in recent times, when technology, as well as the honing of film-making skills, has enabled film-makers to create more realistic, more engaging pieces of art – imitations of life, as some would refer to them. Recently, one such trend of imitation has gained popularity – the adaptations of books into films. With advances in digital technology, film-makers are now more able to recreate words as scenes in a film, often with enhanced dramatic impact. Questions have thus been raised, as to whether this trend will cause books to become obsolete; if you can have it in a picture, which is said to be more expressive than a thousand words, after all, why not? My personal opinion is that, while such films may challenge the popularity of certain books, they will never be able to supplant them, and the practice of reading will live on.\nCertainly, films can be much more entertaining than books, owing largely to the sheer visual impact films can create. That terrifying T-Rex from ‘Jurassic Park’ simply fails to instil fear when stripped of its fangs and thunderous roar, and laid into bare words. The development of digital technology accentuates this, mares allowing directors to create lush, vibrant sets chock-full of dazzling special effects and surround sound. Films will only get better as the technology that goes into producing them improves, and reading books simply cannot provide the experience. same cinematic experience.\nFilms are also more appealing in general – films are usually easier to appreciate and digest compared to books. This is especially true for literature classics such as Shakespeare’s ‘Macbeth’. One who is unable to understand or appreciate classical literature is better off watching a film version of it – at least one still gets to enjoy the story. Due to box office attention, films also tend to receive more publicity, allowing stories from more obscure books to reach the general public.\nThese factors alone might already convince one to give up on reading entirely, but one would be sorely missing out on an enriching experience. In the first place, there is a wealth of book titles, much more than films. Bar some miraculous leap in science and evolution, film-makers will never be able to reproduce all those titles into films. If one limits oneself to only watching films, one will miss out a vast collection of stories and knowledge.\nReading also holds an all-important advantage over watching films – it is powered by, and empowers, the imagination. How enthralling one’s experience is when reading depends a lot on the breadth and depth of one’s imagination. When one reads, one creates in one’s own mind, and guided by the author, the setting, the character, the sounds the whole tapestry along which the story runs is woven from the fabric of one’s imagination, which is more vivid and thrilling than any film can ever be. No doubt, Peter Jackson’s remarkable interpretation of Tolkien’s ‘The Lord of the Rings’ delighted many, but perhaps one who had read the books was expecting Middle Earth to look more, well, medieval? The way a book opens itself to interpretations also makes reading again more exciting and worthwhile, as a story is rarely read the same way twice.\nThis aspect of interpretation also limits the scope of films, giving yet more reason to continue reading. A film is based on the director’s interpretation of the book, as illustrated by the ‘Lord of the Rings’ example. This fact, along with the nature of films to be mere adaptations of books, means one can never take away the complete experience of reading from watching a film. What is more, the director may produce a distorted or objectionable interpretation, such as in the case of Lee Ang’s ‘The Hulk’, which many long-time followers of the comic book disapproved of.\nAnother limitation of a film is that very often it cannot portray certain emotional undertones in a book, nor can it accurately convey the mood or ambience the author might have intended. An actor might be excellent at producing a pained look, complete with that half-wince and barely visible shivering of lips, but he still will not able to show ‘his heart is cracking’ or ‘pain gripped his lungs’. Mel Gibson’s controversial ‘The Passion of Christ’ is an example of how a film is unable to reproduce the transient, spiritual nature of the text it is adapted from, as well as how the power of words is open to a myriad of interpretations.\nFurthermore, reading will always be practical. The improving and development of one’s language, and the convenience of pulling out a book and putting it down as and when one desires, have nothing to do with tradition. Reading is a way to pass the time while improving yourself at the same time – a language workout, some might call it and you can pause whenever you want to.\nTherefore, even though films may appear superior to books, and reading is redundant, one only needs to consider the value of reading to realize that films can never replace the experience of reading. In fact, films often draw attention to the books they were adapted from, such as ‘Seabiscuit’ and ‘Lord of the Rings’. The purpose of such films should be to complement one’s reading experiences, to make the story more complete in a tangible manner. Reading, in itself, is still very much a necessary and practical action that opens up a wealth of possibilities."

                "prompt": "Reading fiction may be entertaining but otherwise it has little real value. Discuss.",
                "text": "Fiction refers to written works that are not based on true events but on the author’s imagination and creativity. Most people read fiction for entertainment and escapism. It is amusing to imagine the life of the characters in the fiction, such as the life of Becky Bloomwood in “Shopaholic Abroad” by Sophie Kinsella. Nevertheless, I disagree that reading fiction may be entertaining but otherwise have little value. Real value in reading fiction can be found when reading is done selectively. Some people read fiction voraciously and eventually they gain nothing from their reading except entertainment and, perhaps. personal gratification. However, when we read fiction selectively and really immerse ourselves in the book, we discover the ocean of values in the book.\nChildren are encouraged to read wisely and widely. Reading fiction in particular can help them to improve their vocabulary. Even in simple children’s fiction such stories, we Roald Dahl’s collection of children’s can find beautiful and humorous figurative language and new words that can improve children’s vocabulary. When children grow older, reading fiction becomes part of their education in school when they take literature. Reading fiction then becomes a task to analyse the character and broader social issues raised in the stories. Another educational value gain from reading fiction is that it gives general knowledge to the readers. For example, law is the essence of most of John Grisham’s novel. Some readers who are law illiterate before reading Grisham’s books would find them really useful as the equip the readers with a lot of information about law. Detective stories such as the adventures of Sherlock Holmes written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle can also serve as brainteasers and encourage the readers to think creatively when they try to guess or reconstruct the scenario of the cases.\nBesides the educational values, reading fictions also give social values. Fiction can promote the culture of the country. For example, in Catherine Lim’s anthology of ghost stories, “The Howling Silence”, she introduced may Chinese beliefs and superstitions that are common in many traditional Chinese families in Singapore. It is intriguing for the foreigners, especially Westerners to learn about these superstitions as they do not have these in their homelands. Through reading fictions, we can also learn of how the society has changed over the years. For instance, “Shanghai Baby” is a brave effort to tell its readers how the women in china have changed over the years.\nBy reading fictions, people can also gain social skills. There are many different characters portrayed in a fiction and we can find most of these characters in real life. In this global world nowadays, people are too involved in the unrelenting rat race and they sometimes become unskillful in relating with people. Fiction authors observe people and their society to provide setting in their novels. When people read novels, they sometimes learn about different types of people and hence improve their understanding on how to relate with different people. For example, in “Sushi for Beginners” by Marian Keyes, three different personalities are portrayed in the novel. They might not be the easy lot of people to handle or relate with but by reading this book, the readers are brought into their lives and the readers will be more understanding to these types of people. Parents and children relationship might not be an easy one. Sometimes parents do not understand why their children act or react in some way. Through some books such as ” Man and Boy” by Tony Parsons and “About A Boy” by Nick Hornby, parents can be more enlightened on how to deal with their children.\nSome fiction have historical values in it. For example, an Indonesian fiction title “Ca-bav-kan” argues on how the Indonesian Chinese have contributed in the struggle for independence of Indonesia in the past. It rebukes the opinion of some people that Indonesian Chinese live like parasites in the country. There is no absolute truth in politics and fiction such as this could give a new perspective on the country’s identity, and even reveal the truth that has been masked for years. Some novels are satires directed to the government. Through these fictions, the authors want to send the message across to the government and most of the time, this message also reflects the aspiration of the society.\nThe value gained from reading fiction depend on the quality and quantity of the reading. If a person reads a fiction briefly and without much understanding, I agree that reading fiction only serves as an entertainment for him and otherwise it has little real value. However, if a person reads selectively and ponders over what he has just read, he will find it more than a mere entertainment. There are messages, values that the writer wants to send across to the reader and just like most of the stories, it has a moral behind it. Educational, social, political values are some of the real values in reading novels. Hence, reading fiction adds values to the readers."

                "prompt": "Telling lies can never be justified. Do you agree?",
                "text": "From the moral perspective, telling lies, which is a form of dishonesty and a means of deception, is wrong. However, in reality there are really very few situations which are totally black or white, and in between the many shades of grey, it may be possible to justify lying. On the other hand, the moral weight of dishonesty cannot be taken lightly, and so the reasons for ever telling a lie should be seriously considered and lying should perhaps be one of the last few options in dealing with any situation.\nUnfortunately, most of the lying that is done is casual lying, done almost without thought; a social function. We lie to be polite, out of courtesy and consideration so as to not offend with our true opinions. We also lie to ‘save face-not to embarrass others and ourselves. Actually, such lies may make this world a much nicer place to be in. Considering the amount of feelings of hurt, anger and psychological agony avoided by this brand of social lying, which hurts no one, lying in this sense may indeed be justifiable; desirable even.\nHowever, there are dangers in ‘white’ benign lies too. Sometimes a small harmless lie has the potential to develop into a tangled web of deception when, in the need to maintain the initial lie, more lies are made. This may hurt more than help – and it is not only the person being lied to who suffers – the one who lies bears the burden of maintaining his deception (ironically sometimes to ‘save face – one of the ends to lying) is plagued by fear of discovery and is weighed down by guilt and regret.\nEven worse, relationships are compromised because of lies. Being ‘tactful’ in social lying may ease tension in our interactions with others, but carried to too far an ex tent may mean there is no honest communication, no true knowledge of another person. Relationships become superficial and shallow it may be devoid of conflict (be cause people refuse to express their true feelings for fear of offending) but it is meaningless. A relationship based on lies is a lie! This case illustrates that though the short term benefits of lying may at first glance seem enough to justify the deed, the long-term repercussions may off-set that justification.\nHowever, there are many cases where it is difficult to decide whether a lie can a justified or not. Can a wife who lies blatantly to hide her murderer husband be pardoned on the grounds of love alone? Perhaps yes, per haps no, depending on perception but even those who demurred may change their minds when the fact that this woman has six children to support and cannot do so with out the husband, is brought in. Justification varies from situation to situation. We cannot just tabulate a list of il legitimate such and such kinds of lies which can be excused but other types cannot. There will always be exceptions, depending on circumstances.\nThere are many ways to try to come up with a frame work to facilitate justification of lies. One way is to assess the ends; another is to examine motive.\n“The ends justify the means’ is a rather controversial statement. It seems to imply there is a lot of leeway for evil as long as the end product is good and beneficial. In the case of lies, this is a possibility. Consider this case in World War II: a German woman lied to her nation’s soldiers to conceal five Jews who had taken residence in her house, because she knew what happened to Jews when they were caught – even at the risk of her own family. The ends: Five lives were spared endless torture and eventual painful death. It is very hard to say this woman’s lies were not justified – lives are highly significant ends. In fact, our army trains our soldiers to lie in the event that they become prisoners of war. Not only would we justify the lies of soldiers who endured for the sake of their people; we would glorify their obdurate lying!\nYet, not everyone agrees that ‘the end justifies the means’ in the event of political propaganda. Governments always claim their motives are good- and sometimes even the end results are good, yet even in the face of such evidence of benefits, there is resentment if people feel they were tricked by lies (or manipulation of the truth) on the part of the government. The bottom line is that people do not like to be deceived and will feel cheated even if you did it for their own good. For these people, the ends which may well include higher standards of living, improved facilities, high employment, do not justify their loss of personal freedom and choice when they were not told the total truth and could not make informed decisions. (Funnily, nowadays, the concept of ‘delayed truth‘ is in.)\nIt may be better to assess motives to see if a lie is justifiable, since lying is a moral issue and motives are very much linked to morals. In the practical world, if a lie doesn’t seem to lead to anything worthwhile, it may not be justifiable. But on the moral level, lying when done out of true compassion and a conscious need to do what is right, is justifiable, no matter what the ends are or whether the lie succeeds in doing what it was intended to do. Very likely lying will lead to pain because it is a dangerous and complicated tool – but many of us still lie knowing that because it is an abstract concept. Sometimes it seems kinder to lie than tell the truth when we rationalise a real life situation. Even a person who is hurt by your lies may forgive you when it is clear your intentions are good, because pure motives are a universal language, recognised instantly and instinctively in a way that all the rationalizing in the world to justify any deed cannot do.\nLet us ask ourselves why there is this inherent need to justify lying – isn’t it because on some level we recognize that lying is a potentially harmful thing which we have no right to truly wield because it is in a sense playing with other people’s lives without their permission? The need to justify… reflects the need to be forgiven, by not only those we implicate by our lies, but also ourselves. We all want to know we have tried our best to do what we think is most right. And it is this desire that will continue making lies justifiable."

                "prompt": "Longevity is a blessing. Comment.",
                "text": "‘Longevity is a blessing.’ It is interesting to note how in the past, the people in the Chinese courts had to wish their emperors ‘Wan sui’ (thousands of years of long life) and even today, the Chinese wish their elders ‘shou bi nan shan’ (May you live as long as the mountains). We have never really pondered whether by wishing them longevity, we are actually blessing or cursing them. How ever, in my personal opinion, longevity is more of a bless ing than a curse. I shall go on to illustrate how longevity is a blessing and also bring out the fact that by wishing our elders long life, it can be an irony too.\nEvery moment of life is precious. We should be seizing every opportunity to learn more, acquire deeper knowledge and wisdom throughout our lives. Thus, a long life is a blessing if we see it as an extended opportunity in life to acquire more knowledge, to see how changes have taken place in society, in the world. A long life allows one to compare the past to the present, and see what kind of changes have occurred. Indeed, it is a blessing for the older generation in Singapore to see how fast the country has progressed, from an undeveloped island to a highly modernized country. I would thus consider it a blessing to be able to live through several phases of change in the country and in the world.\nLongevity would mean more time on hand to do meaningful things, like doing volunteer work, helping to impart wisdom and knowledge to the younger generations. We can see this in the example of Mother Theresa who has lived to ninety years old. Almost all her life, she has been doing charitable work and as long as she lives, de spite her failing health, she vows to continue her work. If we view life that way, then longevity is a longer opportunity to do good and meaningful things. Thus, longevity is a blessing in this case. Furthermore, as one gets older, one gets wiser too, and more experienced. Thus, people with long lives are those with a storehouse of knowledge and experience. Their knowledge can be tapped upon. People like Richard Nixon, Mother Theresa, who are in their old age are being consulted by the world leaders of today because they have gone through a lot. Similarly, every person who has lived a long life can act as a counsellor to the younger generation. Thus, longevity is a blessing in light of this.\nAlso, it is a person with a long life who in his last years, gets to reflect upon his life, whether it be the good old days’ or the ‘bad old days. I always feel it must be quite enjoyable for an old person to reflect on, to reminisce on the past, evoking fond memories and how they got through the difficult times. A person with a shorter life would not have the opportunity to do that. He would probably die still in his working days, too busy to reflect on life. In addition, a longer life would simply mean more time to be with the family, friends. Thus longevity is a blessing.\nHowever, as I mentioned before, it can be an irony to wish our elders a long life, that is, longevity can be a curse too. Firstly, the older one gets, the more prone one becomes to sickness, ailments, like heart problems, rheumatism, backache and so on. The old are subjected to poor eyesight, difficulty in hearing, weak bones and slower reaction. They are thus the ones who suffer falls, often get involved in traffic accidents and so on. Thus in a way, we are actually cursing our elders by wishing them long life. Longevity can be a curse too.\nTo the country, more old people would mean a financial burden on the society and the tax-payers. In society today, very sad to say, old people are being seen as a bur den and even a nuisance. That is why old-folks homes are thriving in Singapore. Longevity can thus become a curse to the country. To reiterate, we are addressing a very controversial issue in the world today. Are old people a burden? Is longevity a blessing or curse? Well, it all depends on the individual. One who wants life to gain knowledge, to do meaningful things would consider longevity. a blessing. However, one who wastes his or her life doing meaningless things or one who is stuck with some incurable illness would probably find longevity a curse.\nNonetheless, I would not want to live too long a life."

                "prompt": "Should marriage be a life-long commitment?",
                "text": "Marriage should be a life-long commitment to a large extent. The term “marriage” may mean different things to people of different races and cultures. In developing nations, it may immediately point to “arranged marriages”, where the bride and groom have no say in choosing their life-long partners. In many developed nations, it could mean just a piece a paper certifying them to be husband and wife in-law, after a period of dating or even co-habitating.\nMany people do not realise that marriage is a life-long commitment. This means that it is to last till “death do us part”, “in sickness and in health”. It is not a means of escape from a chaotic family background, it is a commitment which requires extensive amount of time, effort, and basically endurance for human flaws. It should be a life long commitment because if not, as the Bible says, adultery would have taken place if the divorced couple remarries again and that is a sin. Sometimes it can be said that a marriage should be life-long, because it is a promise made that should be kept, no matter how things change. It is too easy to just give up and ask for a divorce, which is just escaping from problems, and not an answer to the problems.\nMoreover, marriages should be life-long commitment because the family is the most basic unit of society. However because of divorces, relations are often made complicated and chaotic. Children become victims of an unhappy childhood that will leave emotional scars. This will result in a problematic society in future, where commitment is a strange word for many who do not see it in their own parents.\nMarriage should also be a life-long commitment, not only because of what God wants, of keeping to our promises, of being a role model for the future generation, for the sake of containing the already decaying moral values, but also because if marriage is not a life-long commitment, you may as well term it “cohabitation. Many who cohabited excuse it as a try-out test for their future marriage, if there is to be one. Plainly to be seen, what cohabitation really provides is an access to exit, to bail out quickly when problems arise. They are not responsible enough for life-long commitment, that is marriage.\nSome may argue that marriage should not always mean “life-long commitment.” They cite examples like wife beaters, alcoholics or the career woman who mistreat their partners. I recognise that it is easier said than done, but that is where forgiveness, dedication and love come in. Love does not necessarily mean letting the other partner go on erring; instead, it means helping him to come to his senses. All this entails human endeavour that humans are capable of if they try their best and both partners must help each other.\nTherefore, I conclude that marriage should be a life long commitment because basically marriage calls for responsibility. It is a bond not to be taken lightly. It is not a fashion fad, an escape route, or a try-out. They say diamonds are forever, so are marriages."

                "prompt": "Women have never had it so good. How far do you agree?",
                "text": "For decades, women have been fighting for their rights and for equality amongst men and women, by rallying fellow females and making passionate speeches on how women should be treated with equality. Many people believe that they have made remarkable progress, that indeed, “Women have never had it so good.”\nHowever, I feel that it is not fair to say that we, women, have “never” had it so good. The word “never” seems so absolute and final. It is a fact that women in the past were treated shabbily, differently with more indifference and less respect but all in all, I still feel that women, then, had their own perception of what constitutes contentment. For instance, women probably felt happier staying at home, looking after the children and doing house chores. They still gained satisfaction watching their children grow and seeing their husband or family eat the dinner they had prepared. This is all part of a female’s basic instinct, to care for others. Of course, man has always exploited this fact, and by reinforcing the idea that women should be the caretakers of the house, they prevented women from pursuing their own interests. This repression led to women becoming domestic slaves. To any modern man or women, the kind of life they led back then must seem really terrible, therefore creating the idea that women now are re ally leading a far better life than they have ever experienced. I feel that it is not fair to see it this way as society’s morals and expectations of women have changed so drastically through the years thus making the comparison between women’s lives then and now not a very good one since difference standards apply.\nAnother problem is: how does one define “good”? Is it when women are finally on par in terms of equality with men? Where does one draw the line between good and bad? Well, accepting the above idea that women’s lives then and now can be compared, it can be generally said that women’s lives nowadays are more unrestricted, that is, women enjoy greater degree of freedom and more recognition. The fight for women’s rights has come very far to be able to change society’s perceptions and stereotyping tendencies. Previously, women were denied their rights and even in the United States, they were not al lowed to vote or to have any say in anything until fairly recently. Today, many women are finally being recognised for their achievements and praised for breaking through conventions. Prominent females, like Margaret Thatcher, have shown that women, too, can have a say in matters of the world.\nIn the past, women and girls were denied education by the men since they found it to be redundant and use less to one who is supposed to stay at home and bring up children, but the situation is different now, when young girls are given the same opportunities for education as young boys. Females are generally thought to be living better lives in today’s modern world but the question still remains: Can the situation be even better or is this the best society can do?\nI feel that there are still many situations of sexual discrimination which continue to exist despite the fact that life for a female is generally better. This is especially more apparently so in our conservative Asian society where traditionally, men are still believed to be the superior sex. Take Singapore, for example; how many female politicians are there? It is a figure which can be counted on one hand! Although certain ideas (such as the one that women should stay at home) are being gradually worn down, it is still difficult for society to accept certain ideas or dreams a woman might have. For example, a woman might want to join the army but in such a traditionally male-dominated job in certain conservative societies, it is difficult for a lone woman to change this narrow perception. Many women, besides politicians, are also not given the due respect they deserve for achieving so much with their lives. (Changes have been witnessed: Mdm Halimah Yacob as SG’s President, Kalama Harris as USA Vice President, etc) The success of businesswomen who can juggle both a career and family is taken for granted.\nI am aware of the sad fact that men and women can never be on equal terms because of the numerous differences between them – biological, emotional or physical but many improvements to the way women are treated by men and society are still desired. Therefore, to the statement, “Women have never had it so good”, I can only say that I can agree with it. In fact, “Women have never had it bad, at least not in Singapore!”"

                "prompt": "Discuss the moral issues raised by abortion.",
                "text": "Abortion has generated much controversy over the years. Technically speaking, abortion involves the termination of a pregnancy by deliberate means, mainly through medical methods. In this modern era of science and technology, methods of abortion have become so simple and relatively safe that this has caused severe debates to arise.\nFirstly, is the foetus considered to be a life form? If it is, abortion would literally mean murder as it involves taking a life deliberately. In what kind of context is life of the human species truly defined? Is it merely the mechanical functions of life or does it involve the intellectual ability of our species? If it is the former, foetuses do respire and perform most of the metabolic functions of life. In fact studies have shown that they even respond to external stimuli. But even with the vast and complex development of science, nobody still really knows whether the foetus has feelings and thoughts. Moralists argue that a foetus is just like your and me, and hence, denying its right to live is denying life to a fellow human being.\nMoreover, with the advocation of equal human rights taking place so dramatically currently, how can we actually deny life to a vulnerable and defenceless foetus who can not even voice his or her own opinion? But looking at it the other way, the foetus completely depends on its mother to live, hence is it not right that the right of the foetus can be decided by whom it depends solely upon? After all, it is the mother’s body and is she truly prepared to sacrifice her whole life in one way or another for the child she is bearing or does she consider herself a temporary reproducing machine? This involves the right of the mother and hence, whose right is it really? The controversy continues.\nSecondly, are abortions justified in cases of unwanted pregnancies? Truly, if it is not, a victim of rape who did not want her child would have to bear with it and the social stigma she faces for the rest of her life, and it is unfair to the child for being rejected due to something he did not do. Indeed, it would be immoral to force a 12 year-old victim of incest to bear a child, and for a child to bring up a child herself, or to force a couple bearing a child with serious physical and mental deformities to have the child and bring burden and pain to them and the child itself. Many couples who are financially unsound or not ready to have a child would turn to abortion to be practical and for their own good surely. But then, who are they to decide whether the child is to live? Is it not despicable selfishness to sacrifice the life of your own child for your own convenience? Emotional stress results.\nAlong with the moral aspect is the religious one. Roman Catholicism considers abortion a sin as they believe that the soul enters the body on conception and that life, a sacred gift from God, is being tarnished by the act of abortion. Buddhism completely prohibits the taking of a life as they believe very much in the principle of compassion. It is unacceptable in Islam too but due to the belief that the soul enters the body after 120 days of gestation. certain Islamic countries have liberalized their laws such as the Mufti Jordan in 1964, Morocco in 1968 and Kuwait in 1982, with the condition that abortion is carried out before the 4th month and only because of special and extreme conditions and reasons. What is even worse is the act of abortion in multiple pregnancies where certain foetuses are aborted in favour of others. Who are men to know the future only by judging the present? Is it acceptable that the strong foetus is chosen against the weak? The real controversy here lies in the fact that men are playing God or trying to play God and this may backfire on mankind in one way or other. Furthermore, they argue that the liberalisation of abortion laws would even lead to the acceptance of the termination of the sick, old and deformed, that the act of euthanasia may sprout from the action of abortion.\nThis further brings us to the true meaning of life. We have been told and taught that life is a precious gift from God, and it is priceless, invaluable and only given to us once – of course putting the idea of rebirths aside. Is it not a shame to be able to take life in a few seconds, so sim ply, and easily? For example, in Singapore, abortions can be carried out with the mere payment of $5.00. Is life worth only that little? It is truly a degradation of the hu man species by making life seem so cheap and useless. Moreover, with the creation of drugs such as the RU486, abortion can be carried out without any pain at all and the mother is said to be able to ‘dance a jig’ two hours later.\nBut then, why raise such an alarmist view on abortion when suicide, murder and death sentences have existed for such a long long time? There is no set answer for it is up to an individual to decide.\nPro-natalists also argue that abortion is used as a means of population control. Maybe the reaction should be ‘Goodness gracious me!’ Don’t we have enough methods of birth control that save so much trouble by avoiding fertilisation all together? Why conceive at all if one plans to terminate the pregnancy? Must that be the method of birth control she chooses? Indeed, it is horrible to think of it that way but it is true, for certain countries do use abortion for population control reasons. This further pro motes sexual promiscuity as, since abortion can be so easily ‘obtained’, why restrain yourself at all?! For example in Singapore, before the 1970’s, the number of abortions per year used to be less than 50 people but currently, more than 20,000 abortions a year are carried out, 10% being teenagers. The Abortion Act of 1974 allows abortion with the written consent of the mother, and for girls above 18, parental consent is not needed. Pro-abortionists ask why a child should be brought into the world when he is after all going to suffer because of his parents? But then again, who are we to judge the future? Maybe, we should just let nature take her course.\nHence, it is hard to give one rigid stand on the question of abortion for it would seem to be like passing a judgement in the dark, without evidence. The issue should be studied on a case to case basis. Abolishing abortion completely would only lead to more ‘underground abortion clinics’ and allowing it completely would only cause further controversy and conflict. The issue continues."

                "prompt": "Discuss how far are responsible for our own health",
                "text": "With the advancement of medical science, man is now living longer. This results in a greater financial strain on the welfare states of the world where medical and health benefits are often indiscriminately demanded and dished out to the public. It is thus imperative now for us to con sider the advisability and feasibility of state responsibility for health care. I believe that we should be answer able to our bodies, especially in the diet we take and the lifestyle we lead. But, I admit that governmental role is necessary when the fulfilment of this personal duty is beyond us.\nOur health is invariably affected by our diet. The food we partake is beyond governmental control. It is our personal choice that decides whether we buy health products or junk food. The government can encourage healthy living but cannot compel citizens into submission. On the dinner table, we decide whether we want a cholesterol ridden pizza or some bland vegetables. We can have healthier bodies only if we restrain and curb our impulses to gorge. It is only with self-will and determination that we can lower our sugar and calories intake. It is impossible and unthinkable for a health official to hover persistently over us to decide our daily menu. In a way, it is not fair if the state has to take responsibility for the treatment of ailments like high blood pressure when the fault lies in the unwise diet of her citizens. Thus, we should be culpable for our own health as we control our own diet.\nHowever, the government can be responsible in monitoring the quality of food that is imported into the country. Health officials have to ensure that the food on sale is fit for consumption. Though a government cannot deter mine what food is consumed, it can ensure that they can be at least safe for eating. The importance of the govern. mental role is seen in the decision to ban all British beef into European Community (EC) nations after the furore over the Mad Cow disease. Therefore, it is clearly illustrated that by certifying that the food in the market satisfies the health guidelines, the government is being responsible for our health.\nThe lifestyle that we lead also determines the status of our health. One who smokes, drinks excessively or does not exercise regularly has a higher chance of falling ill. We have to make a conscious effort to keep our bodies fit and healthy. We have to possess an innate drive to propel us to keep away from drugs and cigarettes. Though drugs are legally banned in many countries, they are nevertheless peddled blatantly in the streets in others. As for cigarettes, they are a major source of government revenue and it could be politically very hard for the latter to ban their sale. It is all up to the individual to decide what kind of life he wants to lead. The government can encourage smokers to kick the habit but it cannot force them to do so. It can be seen as unjust for the government to treat smokers who have contracted lung cancer when this is the result of their own doing. Certainly we can be responsible for own health by adopting a healthier, better lifestyle.\nWe can take into account our mental health, besides physical health. It is up to us to purposely seek relief from stress. We can plan our own leisure and take up hobbies to pass time. Relaxation is important to keep our body and mind hale and hearty. After a long day’s work, it is imperative for us to enjoy ourselves. To deny ourselves rest and persist to work overtime can be detrimental to our bodies. Yet, it has been argued that the working environment that we live in makes it difficult for us to be accountable for our own mental health. In Singapore, stress can be so overwhelming that it is often beyond us to combat it. The competitive and propelling force be hind Singapore’s economic success also drives her people up the wall. Students are taxed and conditioned to perform. Workers have to persistently upgrade themselves, so as not to “lose the edge of competitiveness”. We are all gladiators in this corporate rat-race, that sanity has become a prized jewel. Thus, it can also be argued that the government can be responsible for our mental health, by complementing a strong economy with citizens that are fit and happy. By advocating less industrial competition, our citizens can have more time for rest and recreation.\nHowever, we have to note that the pursuit of material ism depends ultimately on the individual. It is up to one self to balance one’s life between work and leisure. Thus, again, we can be culpable for own mental health as we can detach ourselves from the stress and strain of society. Yet, not everyone can be responsible for his own health. For those living under the poverty line, government aid is necessary. When deprivation and misery is the norm of one’s life, one will not be inclined to healthy living but survival. Moreover, some health problems like epidemics are beyond one’s control. The COVID-19 virus, Ebola virus and other tropical malaises cannot be attributed to the fault of anyone.\nDespite this, I maintain my stand that we should be responsible for our own health. Though at times, it can be beyond our means and control, in adopting a healthy diet and lifestyle, we can at least ensure that common ailments or diseases are kept at bay."

                "prompt": "In your opinion, what are the aims of government?",
                "text": "When Ronald Reagan was first elected President of the United States in 1980, he was quoted as saying: “Ronald Reagan came to Washington to bury government, not to praise it. The government is not the solution to our problems. The government is the problem.” Yes, good governance seems to an increasingly scarce commodity in existence.\nThis takes a rather negative view of the role of government. However, people expect the government to solve certain problems. These are aims that government should fulfil, the most important being the economic well-being of the people. In today’s society, people do not just want to satisfy their basic needs, they also want greater purchasing power so that they can enjoy a greater bundle of goods and services. The government is always expected to boost economic growth and make the people better off. Economic well-being is the key to stability in the country. Countries with a wide gap between the rich and the poor are most susceptible to revolutions. Such was the case in Central America in the 1960s and 1970s when unrest prevailed, resulting in instability and stunted economies. Bismarck once said, “Men are like animals, they are contented as long as they are well-fed.” The government must make the economic well-being of its people the top priority. Apart from maintaining peace and prosperity, this will also increase the chances of re-election of the democratic authorities.\nAnother major aim of government is to ensure the stability and security of the country, not just internally but externally as well. Economic prosperity may lessen the problem of internal chaos but there is also a need to counter external threats. The international community is not a fairy-tale story where everybody lives together in harmony and lives happily ever after. The successes of a nation can arouse the jealousy of her neighbours or other ill-intentioned nations seeking to flex their military muscles on an expansionist policy. This can seriously dam age the progress a nation has made. In August 1990, the rich but militarily weak Kuwait was overrun by Iraq. Even though it has recovered somewhat, Kuwait has still not regained its economic strength of the 1980’s. At the risk of incurring the wrath of peace groups, I still think that the government should also aim to build strong armed forces to be used as a deterrent against would-be aggressors should diplomacy fail.\nGovernment should also aim to improve the physical and mental health of the people. Environmental standards must be set to prevent over-zealous entrepreneurs from poisoning the earth’s atmosphere and natural re sources. A country of sick men will be of no use to any body. For humanitarian as well as practical reasons, the government should seek to provide health care for the people. American President John F Kennedy’s Medicare and Lyndon B Johnson’s Social Security Amendment Act in the 1960s are good examples of the state provision of health care. The consequences of falling health standards are most evident in India now where the plague is having a field day killing people. Governments must act now and make health care their top priority or it may be too late.\nLast but not least, one of the main aims of government should be to educate its people and try to establish a nation of scholars. The people are the nation’s most valuable resource. They are the ones who contribute to the successes of the nation economically, socially and politically. In fact, a nation is made up of its citizens. It has been proven that people who are more highly-educated produce a larger output of goods and services and are a source of social benefit to the community. There fore, maintaining and raising educational standards should be a major objective of the government. A good example is Singapore where more than 90% of the population is literate. Its strong economic performance and stable society bear testimony to the benefits reaped from a nation of highly educated people.\nIn conclusion, the aims of a government should be to promote economic prosperity, maintain security and in crease the physical and mental well-being of its people. Its fulfilment of these objectives (aka good governance) is a reflection of the successes of a government’s policies."

                "prompt": "Why do countries place so much emphasis on sport?",
                "text": "Today, sport is an activity which is almost unlimited. in its scope and variety, as well as complexity, ranging a com from water sports to land-based games and even aerial competition. Basically, a sport can be classified as a c petition-oriented activity by which individuals maximise their physical endurance, skill and stamina to win within the constraints of the rules and regulations. Nations have always prided themselves on the quality of their national athletes as well as on their sporting development. The reasons for this are multi-faceted and varied, ranging from political, economic to social reasons.\nWithin the scope of political advantage, by examining influence exerted by major international sporting extravaganzas such as the Olympics and the World Cup on the many different nations, we can conclude that these events bring countries together for a common goal in which they form a basic platform on which diplomatic ties can be formed between the host nation and the participating nations as well.\nAnother politically-inclined reason why countries actively participate in international sporting events is that they help in improving global unity as well as international harmony. This is achieved through interaction be tween athletes, officials and even fans who may be of different races, nationalities and religions. Sport will help in promoting unity among nationalities or even erase the wounds of broken diplomatic ties due to misunderstanding or war in the past. This may even, perhaps, help to prevent the outbreak of war or aggression using military power.\nFurthermore, fame and popularity will inevitably be heaped upon the champion nation, hence improving the status and image of that country in the eyes of other nations. This new standing may, perhaps, be an added ad vantage to trade or political agreements among countries.\nEconomic factors also play an important role in enhancing the importance of sport to countries. Firstly, by examining the “sporting industry” as it may be called, we are aware of the large amount of revenue earned by the government as well as businesses generated by this “sports industry”. For example, the advertising industry benefits from companies which sponsor athletes, thereby creating a demand for advertisements based on the sport or athletes’ popularity. Other industries which cash in on sports include sporting accessory manufacturers as well as the construction industry, which is involved in the construction of stadiums and facilities such as pools, courts and gymnasiums. Usually, the construction of large sports in complexes and stadiums involves sound systems, acoustics, electrical wiring and lighting, all of which require professional services and serve as a market for local industries to provide such requirements.\nJob opportunities may also be increased: from the professional sportsmen and sportswomen to coaches, trainers, stadium attendants, promoters, referees, umpires and other sport-related professions and may even involve fields such as medicine, health services or even research and development of sporting gear.\nAnother aspect of economic advantage which sport brings to countries is seen in special cases where a country has the opportunity to host a major sporting event. Large amounts of revenue may be derived from the tourists and fans who come into the country to view the event and also through promotions, advertisements, the sale of souvenirs and tickets. Restaurants and hotels also benefit from the influx of foreigners.\nBy changing our perspective from the economic scene to focus on the social scene, we find that in built-up areas of high population density, it is an important town planning factor to provide sporting arenas and facilities to entertain the local population, especially in housing estates. Furthermore, the development of sporting activities among local young people is important to steer them towards good physical development as well as building qualities such as discipline endurance, patience and de termination, which are prime requisites for success in sports. This helps in turning the younger generation into all-rounded individuals, as well as establishing a healthy and dedicated labour force, which is good for the country’s development and productivity.\nIn addition, sport serves as a form of family activity which helps in interpersonal ties between family members, hence avoiding domestic problems which may lead to the breakdown of the family structure due to lack of interaction. Also, the younger members of the family will be able to fill up their free time beneficially through sports rather than mixing with bad company and being involved in taking drugs, smoking or engaging in criminal activity such as shoplifting, theft, vandalism and assault. Hence, sports can help a country’s government in its effort to fight the rise in juvenile delinquency as well as in establishing healthy, close knit communities.\nFinally, sport is important to a country as it builds national spirit when the population is engaged in sup porting the national team, hence enhancing togetherness when community members are in harmony to cheer for a common dream. This harmonious effect is transmitted to the people of all nations by satellite during international events, hence uniting the hearts of all viewers in a symbolic sense.\nIn conclusion, sport is indeed vital and should be effectively used by all countries, and its value correctly weighed, as it is undeniably a contributing factor to the political, economic and social development of the country, as well as creating mutual understanding among nations."

                "prompt": "Are there reasons for mankind to be hopeful about the future?",
                "text": "In my opinion, there is little reason for mankind to be hopeful about the future. With the fall of the Soviet Un ion and the Warsaw Pact, one might have expected a period of everlasting peace and prosperity in the world. However, this is not the case. The demise of communism and its main bulwark, the Soviet Union, has opened up a Pandora’s box of nuclear arms proliferation, neo-nazism and rising unemployment. In addition, crime rates are soaring in major democracies around the world.\nOne of the reasons mankind should be pessimistic about the future is the rise of fascism and neo-nazism in Europe. The fall of communism in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union left behind an ideological vacuum, as citizens were not adequately prepared for a smooth transition to democracy. Thus, today, communism is being replaced by neo-nazism and fascism in Europe. For ex ample, in Russia communism’s demise paved the way for the rise of demagogues like Mr. Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic Party. Zhirinovsky and his supporters have urged the reconquest of the former re publics of the Soviet Union. In addition, he has vowed to annihilate any nation that stands in his way. Furthermore, he has also threatened to remove all Jews from the face of the earth. We should certainly be apprehensive as Mr. Zhirinovsky and his supporters have considerable clout in the Duma (Russian Parliament). Not only in Russia are such neo-nazis gaining ground; in Italy, the neo-fascists led by Ms. Alexandra Mussolini, Mussolini’s granddaughter, have two seats in the Italian Parliament. Mankind should certainly be worried about such developments as we could revert to an era of tyranny such as that under Hitler and Mussolini.\nThere is also little reason for mankind to be optimistic about the future as the threat of potential war faces us today. The fall of the Soviet Union and its allies has led to the rise of rogue states and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, For instance, Stalinist North Korea, which i suspected of possessing such arms has refused to open up its reactors inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) India has nuclear weapons and Pakistan is suspected of (having an atomic bomb. Relations between the two countries are often strained. Israel and Iraq are also suspected of having nuclear capabilities. Thus, with the threat of nuclear war in the future, we have little reason to be optimistic about the future of mankind.\nFurthermore, mankind should also have a pessimistic outlook for the future as there has been an increase in civil wars recently. For instance, in Bosnia-Herzogovena, the Serbs are slaughtering Bosnians by the thousands under their scheme of ethnic cleansing. More recently, conflict has erupted in Rwanda between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes after the assassination of their President. As a result, many Tutsis have been massacred by the Hutu security forces. What is more disheartening is that the United Nations are not taking any significant measures to end such genocide. Thus there is a strong possibility that more of such conflicts will arise in the future.\nMeanwhile, in the social sphere, mankind should also be pessimistic about the future. To date rising crime rates are experienced in many Western countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States. Moreover, the crimes are becoming more brutal and the criminals younger and younger. Children are no longer the symbol of innocence. For instance, in London, two ten-year-old children were arrested for bludgeoning a toddler, James Bulger to death. Meanwhile, in major cities in the United States people are being gunned down daily. With such ever-increasing crime rates, how can mankind be optimistic about the future if our personal safety is being threatened increasingly?\nIn the economic sphere, mankind also has little rea son to be optimistic about the future. With the fall of the communist nations, one might have expected the world economy to boom due to the emergence of new markets. However, this is not the case. In fact, the fall of communism has worsened the global economic situation by creating massive unemployment and hyperinflation.\nFor instance, with German Reunification in 1989, Western Germany’s unemployment rate almost trebled. This was because most of the citizens of the ex-communist East Germany lacked sufficient training for most of the jobs available. With the reunification the East Germany army was dissolved and this created massive unemployment. In the People’s Republic of China, hyperinflation is rampant as not enough consumer goods. are produced to meet local market demand. Such conditions threaten to persist into the future.\nFor all the reasons mentioned above, we should certainly be pessimistic about the future. However, there is still a grain of hope for a bright future. This can only be achieved if mankind were to put away all political, social and economic differences and cooperate for our mutual benefit."

                "prompt": "What common features do major world cities do you expect to have?",
                "text": "The world has seen an unprecedented rise in the number of major world cities in this century. This phenomenon also signals a shift in the balance of international economics, away from Europe towards Asia. Per haps the predominant question concerning this issue is what constitutes a major world city. This can best be explained by examining the features that major world cities share.\nGenerally, major world cities are often the capitals of the countries concerned. Sydney, for example, is the capital city of Australia. A major world city is cosmopolitan. As such, it is not surprising that all world cities are economic hubs and are the centres of commercial activity in their countries. They are the economic centres of the world. It is interesting to note that usually, these cities’ economies are tertiary based, meaning they are more service-oriented and place less emphasis on industry and agriculture. Singapore, for example, is renowned for the tertiary facet of her economy and often “exports” knowledge of her services to other countries. Major world cities often have high productivity rates as well. Hong Kong, Tokyo and Seoul are all examples of this.\nA skyline of skyscrapers is perhaps the most recognisable feature of a major world city. Due to the lack of land in the city’s economic heart, it is commonplace to see buildings of superlative proportions in major world cities. The infrastructure in these places is also highly developed and they have interconnecting networks of roads and buildings and are likely to boast some of the most advanced telecommunications networks in the world. These cities also have great airports and seaports so as to facilitate visits from foreign businessmen or tourists. Amsterdam and Singapore, for example, have the finest airports and seaports in the world. The technology in these cities is also likely to be highly sophisticated, as can be seen in Tokyo and New York. Due to the abovementioned factors, world cities often host international conventions and meetings. Geneva is often the meeting place of the signatories of treaties, and similarly the United Nations headquarters is located in New York.\nMajor world cities often possess lower infant mortality rates and higher life expectancy rates, compared to other parts of their own countries. This can be largely explained by the advanced medical and health care services in these cities. Berlin, for example, has one of the best medical services in the world. This, however, is coupled with the extremely high costs of living in the cities. People from all over the world, even Japanese, complain about how exorbitant prices are in Tokyo. However, this high cost of living is often accompanied by a high standard of living as well, which basically means that residents of these cities enjoy an amazing array of goods and services, nearly everything from the wonderful West and the fabulous East, so to speak.\nHowever, apart from all these “boons” that are associated with major world cities there are the hectic and often suffocating lifestyles of their residents. These cities often have very high literacy rates, which often mean that society in these cities is largely meritocratic. This is especially so in Asian cities such as Tokyo, Seoul and Singapore. Everyone is struggling to climb the corporate ladder and be competitive. As a result, the residents of the cities often suffer from severe stress and in extreme cases, depression. Observers comment that people from these cities often do not realise there is a lighter side to life, that they often have no time to stop and “smell the roses”. This “rat race” prevalent in most, if not all, major world cities is said to have a debilitating effect on their residents, who become so caught up in the competition. nothing else matters to them.\nAnother telling characteristic is perhaps the high crime rates generally associated with these cities. Apart from exceptions such as Singapore, most of these cities, like New York and Amsterdam, have appalling crime rates. This is perhaps an inevitable aspect of living in the midst of glitz and glamour. Residents who cannot catch up in the “rat race” often resort to crime to satisfy their wants. Furthermore, the infrastructure and even the social aspects of these cities are often conducive to criminal activities. Amsterdam is often used as a meeting point for drug traffickers to exchange their goods.\nIt is not difficult to see that major world cities do in deed share a lot of similarities. No matter how many similarities there are economically, physically or socially, however, each major city will have its own unique set of characteristics, which give each city its unique character."

                "prompt": "How important is the family in the nurturing of youth?",
                "text": "The family is very important in the nurturing of young people. It is the most basic unit of society from which, modern civilization – the organized society that we know and live in – evolved. In my opinion, it always will have a major influence on the actions, behaviour and character of young people. The structure of the family, earlier consisting of several branches of different generations living closely together, has been eroded, reducing the fam ily to a nuclear one. It remains, however, an intrinsic part of the character-building process of an individual.\nPerhaps the most important role of the family is the process of socialisation – the bringing up of children in a certain way of behaviour and the inculcating of certain values in them. These values are the ones the family approve of and should, ideally, be those which society as a whole approves of. Be the parents strict disciplinarians who advocate harsh punishment or those who feel that a softer approach of coaxing and understanding obviates the use of the rod, they play the most basic role of teaching the child how to behave in the family, and then in society later on in her life. Normally parents do not try to inculcate the wrong, negative values unless they have been taught the wrong things by their own parents. It is usually a lack of effort in the teaching process which causes misdirected young people to adopt socially unaccepted behaviour. There may be disastrous consequences if the family does not instruct the young properly. Later on in her life, a young person will meet many different people – some providing positive influences and others undoubtedly bad and meet many challenges. If certain important values, such as, for instance, distinguishing between right and wrong things to do and having the strength of character not to submit to temptation, are not deeply entrenched within her code of principles, then the young person is apt to go on a roller-coaster ride through life, fraught with costly mistakes and distressing confusions.\nThe family is also very important in nurturing young people culturally and religiously. Usually, one’s culture and religion present a code of principles to guide the individual to a more fulfilling and rewarding life and religion, in particular, often lends strength to people in times of distress. The inculcating of cultural and religious values is also an intrinsic part of the socialisation process. If the parents and siblings are staunch believers in a particular faith, it is likely that the young person will be influenced and guided upon a more religious lifestyle. The celebration of cultural festivals held within the family helps the young person to develop a better understanding of her own culture and if these celebrations are enjoyable, it is possible that she will want to understand her culture more. This also means that this particular individual is more likely to help pass the tradition on to successive generations. Thus, it is largely up to the fam ily to make culture and religion a part of young people’s lives.\nAnother important part of the family’s role in nurturing youth is in the sort of influence the parents. and siblings present. I recall an incident when my uncle tried to convince my cousin to work harder in her studies. My indignant cousin retorted matter-of-factly that since her brother did not work hard then she had no obligation to do otherwise! Influence can be divided into two broad categories: good and bad. The bad influence can include anything from a lack of proper manners and using vulgar obscenities to committing crimes. Young children’s impressionable minds are easy victims of such negative influences, and teenagers are encouraged by their elders’ actions and use them to justify their own errors. Good influences, however, lend moral strength and help in moulding young people’s characters.\nLastly, the family’s role is important in nurturing young people through the social environment it presents. It is crucial that the environment the family presents is one of security, warmth and love. Such an environment is conducive to the building of good character, for the young person is not bothered by many other problems she would face in a turbulent environment. Insecurity, in the face of financial difficulties, divorces between bickering parents, and other problems the family faces, threaten the cohesion of the family as a unit and give young people more problems. Young children are confused and helpless in the face of so-called “adult problems” and these problems, especially divorce and poverty, leave scars on the child’s memories and may hinder the child’s ability to form strong and fruitful relation ships in the future. Teenagers already face the stress of their academic endeavour and the confusion of emotional problems, and need a more secure environment for a sense of peace. More often than not, the desire to belong in a larger group and to be popular is observed in a teenager. If she does not experience this sense of belonging even in the family, she is more apt to break down in the face of peer pressure. In more serious cases, teenagers join gangs and other small groups, and then indulge in activities not constructive in improving their lots in life. Thus, it is clear that the youths need a place where they can go back to feel warmth and security and to receive motivation and moral support. A few words of praise and a couple of pats on the back can help a person a lot, as it did me. Such is the power of moral support.\nIn conclusion, the family is a fundamental instrument in the nurturing of young people’s lives. It provides, ide ally, guidance, security, warmth and an environment conducive to good character-building. In addition, it prepares the young person for life in the world outside – society and the challenges it presents and arms her for life to face the trials of modern living."

                "text": "Gone are the days of playing “masak-masak”, “catch” and “five stones” under the shadows of the coconut trees in the kampong clearing. Indeed, in our modern lives, the traditional way of life has taken a backseat due to the fast pace of our society.\nTo have progress in our modern society, we cannot afford to lose time. Tradition impedes progress as according to old beliefs, women should stay at home while husbands work. I would mean reducing the workforce by half. Nowadays, girls receive the same education as boys. Thus girls have equal ability to work and make contributions to the economy. Women, now, are shed ding their roles as housewives, folding up their aprons to go out to work, to help maintain the high standard of living.\nTraditional beliefs about the inheritance of land in India have brought many problems to the country. On the death of the landowner, the land is shared among the sons and thus divided into smaller and smaller portions until the land is not able to provide the family with a decent standard of living. Also, in India and China, people favour boys instead of girls. They have a traditional belief that boys will carry on their family’s name while girls are just a waste of money. This has led to unfair treatment of women and discrimination against baby girls. This traditional belief had taken away the lives of many baby girls. It is hard to accept that in this modern world, such absurd beliefs exist.\nNowadays, there are still some people who believe that a magic stone rubbed on the skin or some talisman burnt into ash and put in water will cure an illness. There is no scientific evidence that these traditional cures work, and so it is best to seek proper medication before an illness gets worse. When it comes to festivals, the traditional way of celebrating Chinese New Year is a fifteen day holiday when everyone visits their friends and relatives. From the economic perspective, if a factory were to stop production for half a month, it would suffer losses. That is why many traditional celebrations are simplified nowadays as in modern society, it is too time consuming, and impractical to follow every traditional belief and celebrate every festival.\nOn the other hand, tradition does help in giving the economy a boost. In traditional festivals such as Chinese New Year, it is traditional for people to buy furniture and new clothes. Consumer spending increases and thus stimulates the economy. Such festivals also help to keep the family together. In modern society, families tend to be small. Festivals give them a reason to come together to celebrate. For example, Hari Raya Puasa which the Malays celebrate, brings the whole community together not only to celebrate but to do good deeds by donating foodstuffs and money for the less fortunate. Such festivals also enable people to get to know other races and cultivate tolerance and understanding between races.\n“Yeo’s, tradition in a can.” This slogan has been used in advertising the glass jelly drink Yeo Hiap Seng has been promoting. Believe it, or not, people have a tendency to favour things from the good old days. Several hotels have been using slogans such as “Come savour the traditional Nonya delicacies” to promote their buffets and turn them into a money-spinning business. Some watches and even cough mixtures boast of traditional methods of manufacture. Nowadays, more and more people are seeking the traditional methods of healing, brewing herbs for several hours and gulping down the dark, foul smelling soup with the bitter taste, as traditional cures are said not to be as “harsh” on the body as western drugs.\nTradition is just like drinking Chinese tea. It needs time to be appreciated and is a slow process. Due to the fast pace of modern life we cannot afford to lose time and so we will have to settle for our usual Lipton’s three in-one. Tradition has not been forgotten as it is in our roots but we cannot slow down for tradition or we will find others overtaking us in the rat race."

                "prompt": "How should the criminal be treated?",
                "text": "We usually think of a criminal as a person who commits acts of gross depravity, has absolutely no respect for humanity or the law and who is a threat to society and we feel that he or she should be locked in a cell and the key thrown away. But seldom do we stop to examine the reasons a person becomes a criminal. What drove him to commit these acts? We must consider all the factors before condemning a person to a life as a “criminal”. How a criminal should be treated is a question that has been debated for centuries. Changing social and political scenarios influence the way criminals are treated, although P the basic approaches through retribution, and rehabilitation remain the same.\nThere are basically two approaches to the treatment of criminals. The liberal approach seeks to fight crime with reason. The defenders of this approach want to understand crime as much as to fight it, to offer criminals a chance of a better life so they will see the error of their ways. It emphasises correction and rehabilitation. In contrast to this the tougher approach emphasises punishment and deterrence. Supporters of this particular approach feel that criminals should be punished according to their crimes and support the philosophy of “an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” They incorporate both corporal and capital punishments into their justice systems. But whether these are effective deterrents is debatable.\nIn order to bring about a system by which a criminal is treated fairly and at the same time not let off easily, a number of steps must be taken. Firstly the justice system needs to be revamped. Steps should be taken to ensure that the trial is conducted fairly and that the jury are not emotionally swayed in any way. Efforts should be made to be light on first-time offenders who should be counselled and put in correction centres to prevent them from turning into hardcore criminals. Repeated serious offences usually warrant a more serious form of sentence such as e incarceration. But only in extreme cases should capital punishment be used and if it is, then it should be done only after a thorough analysis of the criminal and his crime. Also criminals should be executed in the most humane way possible to minimise suffering, as well as dis tress to family members.\nOne of the biggest problems facing the justice system at present is the deteriorating conditions of prisons. Prisoners are forced to live in filthy, often crowded cells and the food provided is inadequate. Thus there is a need for better planned prisons with adequate living space for each prisoner. Sanitation and cleaning should be improved. The meals provided should be nutritious since usually prisoners must do some form of work. They should also be suitably paid for this so that when they are released they will have some form of financial support. The system of solitary confinement should be abolished as it can cause a lot of psychological harm to a prisoner.\nThe authorities must try to rehabilitate criminals as far as possible through counselling and therapy. Psychiatric help should be provided when necessary. Visits from family and friends should be allowed more frequently and mail should not be censored. Each prisoner should be treated individually and his privacy should be respected. This will help to reduce the otherwise dehumanising effect of prisons.\nThe persecution of criminals continues even after their subject to constant hostility and ill-treatment release but this time by society. They find it difficult to find work as people are reluctant to employ ex-convicts. Society should be more tolerant towards them and accept them into the fold. Though these measures seem idealistic, it would do a lot of good if even some attempts were made to reform the system. This would ultimately help to fight the scourge of crime that currently affects our society."

                "prompt": "Why do people want to have children?",
                "text": "People have children for many reasons. As human beings are biological creatures, reproduction is an intrinsic part of existence. Children often bring joy and happiness to their parents and though parenting is not an easy task, it is definitely the experience of a lifetime.\nSome people have children in order to ensure that they. will be taken care of when they are frail and weak. This practice is common in all Asian societies but not so in Western societies which have pensions and social security systems. The Chinese have a saying which goes like this: “Have children to guard against old age.” As filial piety is a much emphasized virtue in Asian societies, most parents can be sure that their children will not abandon them when they are old. Therefore, having children is a form of investment in which the dividends will be given back to the investors in their old age. However, this rea son for having children is gradually becoming less com mon due to the high costs involved and the belief that. children should not be born into the world with a huge debt to repay.\nSome people also have children because their tradition compels them to do so. The Chinese have another saying which goes like this: “There are three serious ways of being unfilial, and not having children is the most serious one.” From this saying, it can be seen that having children is a very important matter in Chinese society. This is also the case in most other Asian societies. This is due to the fact that some traditions place great emphasis on having the family surname carried on. This in turn causes Asian societies to favour boys over girls as girls have to take on the surnames of their husbands after they are married. In China, the Chinese are so desperate to have baby boys that they keep on having children until they have at least one boy, and this is despite the strict ‘one-child policy’ enforced by the Chinese government. People caught flouting such rules are given hefty fines and forced to have abortions and be sterilized. There fore, the willingness of the Chinese to flout such rules in order to have baby boys shows just how great an influence traditions have on the decision to have children.\nThe need for manual labour and extra income is also a reason for people having children. In agricultural societies, an extra pair of hands means that more land can be farmed or that the load is lightened with the sharing of work. Children can also undertake work in other places and supplement the family income. This practice is com mon in countries with agricultural societies like India. In Pakistan, young children of poor families are sold to car pet makers. Rich families have children to ensure that the family business stays within the family, usually with the eldest child taking over from the father.\nPeople also have children to bring happiness to their lives. Children can be a constant source of pride and joy to their parents. Certainly, no one can deny that the look on the faces of parents when they hold their newborn for the first time is one of pure, unadulterated joy. Children bring such great joy to parents that some who are unable to bear children for one reason or another go to great lengths to do so. These include costly artificial insemination, fertilisation or even asking another person to bear their child for them.\nSome people also have children because they have a biological need to do so. Some older single women say that they feel their biological clock ticking away and they feel a great need to have babies. In more liberal societies, these women may become single mothers if they cannot find a life-long partner in time. Despite the stigma attached to single parents, single mothers are not be coming less common as the biological need to have children is often an almost irresistible urge.\nTherefore, it can be seen that there are many reasons people have children. However, before bringing a new life into the world, people must think long and hard about it as children are vulnerable and require lots of love, attention and guidance."

                "prompt": "Today the plight of children reveals the ugly side of man. Discuss.",
                "text": "Almost certainly, today the plight of children reveals the ugly side of man. In many parts of the world, children are still suffering. Undesirable, contemptible characteristics which include greed, selfishness or the exploitative nature of man have led to the plight of children. These children experience pain of various types – mental, physical and emotional.\nChild labour is one of the obvious things that reveal the ugly side of man. Children in some parts of the world to work in factories, for example in textile factories. They are given low pay and have to work hard and long hours. In India, children make expensive branded goods for civilised people in the West to wear. However, these children are paid miserably and even abused. Although many Westerners are oblivious of this, it reveals the exploitative and manipulative side of man for companies in both developing and developed countries make use of children as cheap labour and get huge profits in return by selling the goods. Child labour is unfair because during childhood, children develop and should be given the chance to be educated and enjoy life. They also lack the ability to fight for themselves and are easily exploited. It is just not the right time for them to work. The problem of child labour occurs easily in some countries; others have laws against child labour and the need for education during the early years is recognised, but where it does exist it does reveal the ugly side of man.\nAnother example is sexual abuse which contributes to the mental and physical pain of children. There is child prostitution in some countries. In red-light districts of Bombay, India and Chiangmai, Thailand, child prostitution exists. Local and foreign clients take advantage of them. Child abuse also occurs at home. Fathers may rape their own daughters and they are forced not to tell any one or make a report to the police. There are many con sequences. The children experience physical torture during sex abuse. The child’s modesty is outraged and he or she loses a bright future. These children unfortunately may be infected with sexual diseases like syphilis and AIDS. This reveals the ugly and corrupted side of men, who make use of children to satisfy their sexual needs because the children are helpless beings and cannot de fend themselves. This problem may not be widespread, and there are strict laws in many countries against sexual abuse, moreover, many children lead peaceful untormented lives. Nevertheless the existence of such abuse reveals the ugly side of man.\nForced child marriage is common in developing countries such as India where daughters are compelled by their parents to marry someone at an early age. In Saudi Arabia, young girls are sold by their parents to old Saudi Arabian men. These girls are often concubines. In China some young girls are forced to marry young two-year old boys from rich families. In return the girls’ families will get a sum of money. These young girls will have to look after their husbands and accompany them for the rest of their lives and later these girls are often abandoned by their husbands. In India, girls are also forced to marry young because many families feel that it is too expensive to look after girls. This reveals the selfishness of man. These people force their children to marry some one they do not love or know and this is done without their consent. This problem of early marriage is wide spread in Third World countries, however in most developed countries, children often marry at a mature age and with a freedom to choose their own life partners. For all this I believe the ugly side of man still evident here.\nNowadays children are often neglected by parents and this occurs even in a modern society. Children experience mental and emotional pain in such situations. Once children are neglected by parents, they lack their parental love, warmth, care and guidance. They do not have anyone to nurture them. The children’s minds are not stable and may be easily influenced into bad ways. One main reason why parents neglect their children is that they are too occupied with their office work or too busy pursuing their careers or are involved in less savoury occupations. In a few cases, the parents totally neglect their children’s feelings and limits. They have too high expectations for their children and want them to excel academically. This leads to an absurd amount of pressure and the occasional suicide. This reveals the selfish and ironically uncaring side of parents who are only interested in their work and do not bother about their children but expect them to do well in their studies. For all that, most parents today try to keep their weekends free to accompany their children and provide them with all their love and support. Ugliness is still a feature of man’s nature when these things are missing.\nThere are other unthinkable cases of child abuse. In Thailand and Vietnam, there are children who are kidnapped by some men and parts of their bodies are amputated so that they look like cripples. These children are then forced to be beggars. The money in turn will be collected by those ruthless men. Some babies are killed and their organs are removed and sold to the hospitals for transplant operations. The people who sell the organs are paid a high price. This reveals the cruel and greedy side of man. Despite the fact that the children are suffering physically, some people have no compassion for them.\nThough countries and societies are advancing technologically and economically, man can still be uncivilised. Indeed, the plight of children today still reveals man’s ugly side."

                "text": "The fact that the United Nations has designated 1994 as the year of the family definitely says something about the importance of the family unit. The family, said to be the basic unit of society, was once something people appreciated and respected. Recent changes in the fabric of our society have made the family something people take for granted.\nThe family unit is important in that it provides a base for an individual to start the perilous journey of life. The family plays a major part in shaping a person’s character and inculcating some basis of moral values in a person. This is a function which has been greatly undermined by the way our society operates today. Negative influences are easily found nowadays. Schools, peers and the mass media have the ability to distort and change the way a young child thinks and behaves. Many other factors con tribute to the shaping of a child’s mind, and this makes a strong family unit all the more important in guiding and teaching the child, telling him right from wrong.\nNo doubt, a stable family plays a vital role in a per son’s formative years. But even fully developed adults need a family. In the hectic, competitive and stressful world of work today, a people need warm and loving families to support them in doing their work. Other than serving as a sanctuary and place of retreat, the family can help a person with a positive and encouraging attitude. Nothing works better as a remedy for work pressure than the knowledge that at the end of the day, a warm and caring family is waiting for you to get home and rest. This may, in some cases, motivate people to work harder in order to improve the living standards and material com fort of their families.\nOne important and often overlooked function of the family is to give love and concern for a person so that the person can in turn spread and pass it on to others. It has. been proven that children from abusive families often grow up to be anti-social. Even single parents cannot hope to provide the kind of love that a complete family unit can bring to a child. As a general rule, children from happy families with full and loving childhoods grow up to be come gregarious and cheerful people.\nIt is ironic that society, which the family is supposed to serve, is destroying family values. Teenagers respect. their parents less nowadays; they would rather “hang out” with their friends and often neglect their families in the process. The great increase in leisure and entertainment facilities has contributed to this. Mounting work pressure and the fear of being deemed “not economically vi able” by their firms have turned many working parents into workaholics leaving their children to the care of relatives or child care centres. Rocketing divorce rates have left many children living in single-parent families. Af fluence in some countries has given rise to a materialistic attitude to life and people have begun to treat a family as a burden, preferring to live and earn on their own.\nThere is no way we can underestimate the importance of the family in our world today. Indeed, the decline of our social conditions can be attributed to the lack of emphasis on family values over the last few years. As mentioned earlier, people are taking their families for granted. They are no more an important part of people’s lives. I am glad that the UN has recognised this problem and tried to bring back the family into our lives by promoting family values. Families shape people, people shape societies. The importance of the family has not been and will never be reduced."

                "prompt": "\"The only means to censorship is self-regulation.” Do you agree?",
                "text": "Censorship is purposeful and deliberate withholding of information or entertainment of any medium from an individual’s observation. However administered, one loses sources of information of any kind. Censorship is generally implemented to protect the individual’s mind from external influence of any kind, since information often carries with it values and ideals as appurtenances to the raw details. As a tool, it reinforces the need for propriety in society as enforced by institutions, standards and conventions, and is thus implemented in strict accordance with the social code. Self-regulation, as a form of censorship, is the deliberate exclusion of materials and information by the individual himself and the medium itself and is thus unique to other forms of censorship, which stress fundamentally on an externally administered disciplinary force. In consideration of the benefits of self regulation against the overwhelming difficulties and in adequacies of other means of censorship, I agree with the statement that self-regulation is perhaps the only means to censorship if that means is to be successful.\nSelf-regulation is a manifestation of an individual’s sense of discipline – it is a means entrenched within his mind, and functions continually in the individual; it is omnipresent, and, in a way, omniscient. Other forms of censorship include an inherent element of the necessity for a disciplinary authority. Be it the film censor who denies people beneath the correct age group to view so called “adult” films, or the parent who imposes strict rules on quality viewing, there is the need for a person or a group of persons to be able to monitor the actions of the individual.\nMan, however, is a slippery, intelligent creature – the means of obtaining the information come in a multiplicity of ways open to the resourceful individuals. The films one cannot watch are easily available on video tape, while books banned in one country may be easily available in another. In part, this availability is due to the diversity of the mass media industry, where technology has played a large role in the widespread dissemination of information and heightened abilities of duplication have increased the opportunities to obtain such information. Also, this availability is attributed to the very human trait of covetousness, which allows the profiteer to recognise in the banned materials a very lucrative trade, since people would easily pay high sums for such “valued” items. The two therefore render externally-administered means of censorship grossly inadequate and ineffective as a means of withholding information.\nIf availability is the main point defeating other means of censorship, then self-regulation is easily its nemesis. However convenient and available the sources of restricted information are, self-regulation imposes a rule over the individual that the black-market profiteer can never hope to breach. Whenever he goes, the self-regulatory control within the individual is there to give the warning signs. However secret the profiteer or source is able to operate his trade, this control is never ignorant of an advance towards the individual – hence the “omniscience” – and thus protects him effectively against corruption or influence of any sort. Hence, self-regulation may be the only means of censorship.\nSelf-regulation here, though, may not be thoroughly effective, since its force stems from the individual’s character and integrity. Should these traits falter, self-regulation becomes an even worse way of censorship than any other.\nSelf-regulation may also be seen as the only means of censorship in the light of how other forms of censorship produce a negative side effect. Human curiosity is often prompted by such deliberate withholding of information. Furthermore, the significance and force of this information is accentuated by the strictness of the measure, and this renders the information even more attractive to the individual. The strict measures evoke in the individual another very human trait: aggression, provoked by such apparently arbitrary oppression of the human mind, manifests in a sense of rebelliousness. The somewhat perverse approval of rebellion-ness as a sign of strength and freedom by one’s peers in a society riddled by elements advocating extreme freedom, and the subsequent popularity that might ensue, provide a very powerful incentive for the individual to obtain the restricted information. The above combination makes for individuals who directly seek to subvert regulatory forces in society, hence defeating the aim of censorship. The youths of today are particularly susceptible to such symptoms, mainly because of the advent of liberalism and materialism. To cope with such subversive forces, society might implement even firmer, stricter measures, only to find the subversive force has increased as a result.\nSelf-regulation controls the curiosity and rebellioness of an individual in a way no external authority could. Be cause self-regulation is home of discipline and a firm, entrenched understanding of the undesirable nature of restricted information, curiosity and rebellionness are controlled by these characteristics. In this context, it is the only means of censorship, since other means only intensify the undesirable side effected.\nThe desirable nature of self-regulation may also be seen by comparing the short and long-term effects of this and other means of censorship. As noted before, other means of censorship require dominant authorities to enforce the regulation of materials. In the short-term, these means are far more effective than self-regulation, since self-regulation requires an education of some sort – be it from the family or the school or some government campaign-to inculcate the proper values of restraint and discipline that render the device effective. In the long term however, these other means of censorship may fail in protecting the psychological and mental health of a people since many things might occur to defeat these authorities. Anew government may be formed, relaxing the regulation in censorship. Wars and natural disasters may read the authorities temporarily paralyzed, but this is sufficient for an explosion of information to hence people’s minds. As a result, the effort and money put into the censorship may be wasted eventually. Now, however where externally-administered agents of censorship falter, self-regulation may ultimately triumph.\nFuelled by personal desire and borne of individual discipline and rectitude, external elements face a psychological wall resistant to penetration. Where new tyrannies may hope to subvert the society, such as dictatorships, the mind is buttressed against the corruption of such subversive ideas, In the long-run, therefore, self-regulation may well be the only means of censorship.\nHowever, the persistency of self-regulation may well stultify the mental growth of an individual. Once one’s mind is narrowed by self-regulation based on a strict doctrine, one loses the open-mindedness needed for creativity, innovation and a general broadening of one’s horizons. This self-regulation, if enforced by the strict bar raging of one’s mind by education, becomes a result of brainwashing. Self-regulation, therefore, to be effective as well as conducive to the individual’s mental growth and development, must also include a general flexibility and open mindedness.\nIn terms of goals to be achieved, self-regulation may well be the only means of censorship. Censorship hopes to train the individual to be a responsible member of society without excessive corrupt influences, and through the exclusion of such influences, strives to create a discerning and responsible individual, well trained in the ideals of moral rectitude and discipline, necessary for social cohesion. Self-regulation, though, is already a product of these ideals-without these it cannot succeed. There fore self-regulation, in being the eventual goal of all forms of censorship, may be the only means of censorship.\nIn conclusion, one may see that self-regulation, while being an intangible asset borne of mental and moral capabilities may be difficult to implement. However, in the light of the general inefficiency of other forms of censor ship, it can be considered the best, if not the only means of censorship. Perhaps it should be noted that self-regulation is best when administered alongside other forms of censorship, each reinforcing the impact of censorship of the other. The only other means of censorship to control people, perhaps, is complete arbitrary control by a single dominant authority, but that would result in a “zombified” people – sluggish and uncreative mentally, and forever backward in innovations and development.\nPerhaps here self-regulation’s greatest benefit is shown: borne of the individuals’ own discernment and moral code, it not only trains the individual in mental toughness and resolution, it allows a wide lassitude for the entrance of new, stimulating ideas, allowing the individual to become well-rounded and complete in his intellectual accomplishments."

                "text": "As the world braces itself for the twenty-first century, many recent political, economic and technological advances are gradually transforming it into a global village. However, as parts of the world remain embroiled in unresolved feuds, the threat of a global war remains real. Nevertheless, as international trust and co-operation slowly become prevalent, I believe that the threat of a global war (WW3) is becoming a distant possibility.\nFifty years after the bombing of Hiroshima, the horrors of the Second World War continue to haunt the world. Man has learnt from the destruction of this war and is conscious of the need to maintain peace. Extensive efforts have been made to reduce the threat of war, with the United Nation (UN) as the most significant landmark. The UN has helped reduce many conflicts through inter national co-operation, and continues to receive tremendous support from member states. Despite recent fighting in Bosnia and Chechnya, the UN continues to function as a medium to ease tensions, through mediation and international pressure, virtually removing possibilities of an all-out global armed confrontation.\nAnother major post-war development was the Cold War between the Communist and Western democratic nations. However, this ideological conflict has since thawed and greatly reduced tensions in world politics. Replacing the military build-ups of the Cold War, are previously seemingly impossible scenes of international friendship and co-operation. For example, former Warsaw Pact members recently sought NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation) membership, and trade between the former communist bloc and the European Union has also increased enormously. Even though the ideal of world brotherhood remains distant, one can only look at these developments with optimism.\nOne of the results of the end of the Cold War is the reduction of arms by major military powers. For example, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) be tween the United States and Russia augurs well for world peace.\nEven though critics may argue that a subsequent effect of this is the purchasing of arms by Third World countries, we should not be unduly worried. This is because as many of the weaker countries arm themselves in defense, aggressor nations will be effectively deterred from waging wars. Hence, this redistribution of military might will serve to implement a new world balance of power and probably reduce the chances of a major war.\nAnother reason for optimism is the increasing importance of international trade in our world. As competition for trade intensifies with the rise of many developing countries, countries have never been as reliant on economic co-operation. This helps to divert attention from differences and also allows nations to be open to one another. Moreover, isolation from the global community. would be catastrophic and this subsequently allows space for international diplomacy and pressure to be applied in the name of peace. For instance, North Korea’s initial stand of indifference over the inspection of its nuclear facilities was softened after promises of economic aid, thus removing an impending nuclear crisis.\nFurthermore, with increasing standards of education, many people are learning the need for acceptance and integration with other races and religious groups. The vehement opposition to Neo-Nazis in Germany and the political breakthrough made in Israel-Arab relations are evidence of this. This development has greatly down played racism and ultra-nationalism, ensuring global understanding.\nIn conclusion, the world will always remain under the threat of a global conflict. Peace-keeping efforts should be maintained and complacency must never be allowed to develop. With these in points mind, recent developments should have reduced the likelihood of a Third World War."

                "prompt": "Is there a need for regional cooperation today?",
                "text": "Regional cooperation is simply cooperation between members of a region. While there is usually unwritten mutual cooperation between different countries, and especially neighbouring countries in the region, many countries have brought this cooperation one step further by forming internationally recognized groups. Examples include the European Community (EC) and the Association of South-cast Asian Nations (ASEAN).\nMany regional organisations are formed on the basis of economic cooperation. This is particularly applicable in today’s context where many countries are hard hit by recession and unemployment. An example of regional economic cooperation is the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by the United States, Mexico and Canada. This free trade agreement between these three neighbouring countries is expected to stimulate their flagging economies by creating a larger market and more employment opportunities. Movement of capital, labour and other resources among the member countries is also simplified with the removal of much red tape. This leads to more efficient resource utilization. All this constitutes an ideal free trade area within the region. As Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations puts it, only free trade will result in more opportunities of specialisation and hence output, which in turn constitutes a nation’s wealth. How ever, some regional economic organisations violate this rule when they encourage free trade between members but practise protectionism against the rest of the world. Such a regional trading bloc is harmful not only to the world economy, but also to itself in the long run as there can be no safe regional isolation in the interlinked world of today. Protectionism will only provoke the rest of the world to boycott the errant region, leading to more severe economic crises within it.\nRegional cooperation is also needed to promote political security. The world today is troubled by too many conflicting players and voices and no effective international leadership, Grouping the various individual countries into regional blocs with one voice will undoubtedly help lessen the chaos of today’s international political scene. However, such a goal is not easily achieved for there is often disagreement among regional group members themselves, such as within the EC and the Commonwealth of Independent States.\nMilitary cooperation between regional countries will also help put a dampening pressure on any rising aggressive sentiments of a foreign country. This will help discourage the outbreak of wars of aggression and contribute towards international peace. Political cooperation within the region will also help promote internal stability within each member country. Dissident factions within each country may be less prone towards militant rebellion, knowing that they will face the censure of the region.\nLast, but not least, regional cooperation will mean faster, more efficient aid to members in times of disaster. Within the ASEAN community, aid, in the form of medicine and trained rescue workers is sent by other members to the disaster-plagued member immediately once assistance is asked for. Such regional help arrives faster than any international aid, which may take a longer time to mobilise.\nHence, there is a need for regional cooperation. However, caution must be taken so that in the pursuit of regional aims the welfare of the international community as a whole is not overlooked."

                "prompt": "Discuss what makes a good entrepreneur.",
                "text": "Tang’s Shopping Centre, located strategically in the busy Orchard Road area, is one of the most successful enterprises of Mr C K Tang, who came all the way from. China during his youth with nothing more than a casket full of embroidery for sale and an overwhelming ambition to make a name for himself in the business world. He succeeded, and to me, he is one of the most enterprising entrepreneurs I have ever read about.\nWhat, then, makes a good entrepreneur? I think, in the world of business full of setbacks, pitfalls and risks, the first quality a good entrepreneur must possess is a strong desire to succeed and a steely determination to go along with it. The good entrepreneur must be equipped with an indomitable spirit such that in the face of hard ship or temporary failure, he is able to keep going, even though success may seem remote.\nAlso, a good entrepreneur should be humble and willing to learn from senior entrepreneurs who have more experience. Young, inexperienced and idealistic entrepreneurs, are prone to making rash judgements and coming up with impractical ideas and they often turn a deaf ear to warnings from more experienced entrepreneurs. Such an approach is wrong because a solid foundation should always be built, a stable pool of clients be established, incomes stabilised before moving to fresh challenges. A good entrepreneur should recognise these points as they provide the bedrock for entrepreneurial success.\nFor an entrepreneur to set up a business is hard; it is even harder to make it a success. The process of running a business is complicated and requires much patience and diligence from the entrepreneur. Without patience, hard work, and a certain tenacity to hang on to his business, an entrepreneur cannot label himself a good one. A good entrepreneur must realise that his business is like a deli cate plant that demands much care, attention and patience from him before it can blossom into success.\nThe commercial world can be likened to weather which is unpredictable. It may be bright and sunny one moment but a dark, imminent thunderstorm may loom the next. Thus, a good entrepreneur must be not only willing to take risks, he must also trust himself to make the right judgement; that is, belief in his own actions must be firmly rooted in his heart. This is because in the business world, events move very quickly and an entrepreneur cannot spend time debating whether his past decision was the right one. That will only lead to pessimism and undue hesitation which are not qualities of a good entrepreneur.\nBeing a good entrepreneur, he must have foresight and his decisions must reflect a kind of helicopter vision. One of the persons I admire, Mr C K Tang, showed just that kind of farsighted approach when he decided to build the existing Tang’s Shopping Centre. He was not at all disturbed by the existence of a cemetery directly in front of it. He was not at all swayed by opinions that reflected the superstition of common people and even confidently predicted that the area where Tang’s Shopping Centre was to be built would in future, become a busy and crowded place full of shoppers, and it did. It was this helicopter vision and faith in his choice that led Mr CK Tang to be one of the most successful entrepreneurs in Singapore. Good entrepreneurs should emulate this striking example.\nI also think that shrewdness must be an inherent quality in a good entrepreneur. This is because in business there will be certain subtle advantages and traps which must be discerned by a shrewd entrepreneur and used to his best advantage. If an entrepreneur cannot detect these subtleties, it is unlikely that he will be able to succeed because he is handicapped in the ability to grasp golden opportunities.\nA good entrepreneur must be shrewd enough to anticipate beneficial changes and grasp them. He must be prepared for certain danger and treachery and avoid falling into business traps that may ruin him. With shrewd ness, and an opportunistic nature, a good entrepreneur is always one step ahead of others in the competitive business world and thus is on his way up the ladder of success.\nInterpersonal skills are also important for a good entrepreneur. There is lot of interaction in the commercial arena and whether a businessman can successfully clinch a business deal depends a lot on his communication skills. A good entrepreneur must be well-skilled to detect nuances in body language, and speech patterns so as to manipulate them to his benefit. He must also know how to present himself and his proposals favourably because physical impressions do count in the business world. A good entrepreneur should understand the importance of public relations skills and work hard to acquire them.\nAlthough the above points will undoubtedly make an entrepreneur both successful, efficient and to a certain extent “good”, I think a last vital point to turn the entrepreneur into a really “good” one is a good heart. By this, I mean that the entrepreneur must be compassionate and contribute frequently to charity when he is successful. He must be honest and not try to cheat others, which might bring about his own downfall. Moral values should be rooted in him such that he will not resort to illegal or immoral activities to lead him up the ladder of success. He must show his gratitude to people who helped to make him successful and also to society as a whole for giving him a chance to prove himself.\nA good entrepreneur is not too obsessed with profits to be neglectful of his social responsibilities. Indeed, he tries not only to look after his own welfare but also that of society. Such an entrepreneur is not only “good”, he is excellent."

                "prompt": "“All art is useless (Oscar Wilde).” Comment.",
                "text": "It is an indisputable fact that art plays an extremely important role in our daily life. This is because we have realised that it is essential to the preservation of our more austere and connotative side. It is through art that human beings are able to find a common ground of appreciation and acknowledgement. In one sense, art is already an integral part of our lives.\nWe must recognise that without art, our daily life would be one that is monotonous, bland and meaningless. Nowadays, science and technology have diluted our lives, and the obsession with achieving economic track has turned many of us into slaves of money. People are mostly concerned with attaining status, power and fame. Being too preoccupied with keeping themselves ahead of the rat race and abreast of the current trend, they simply find them selves bogged down in a quagmire where life is only an empty sheet of paper deprived of all colours, that will become torn and tattered with the merciless onslaught of time. But fortunately, many have not forgotten art and through art, they are rejuvenated and given a new lease of life. Art brings colours to their dark and bleak world, and it is these colours that people find meaning in life. In this respect, art is not to be viewed as useless. In fact, art is a profession by itself and brings in the dough. (Since the last 2010 decades, a new type of cryptocurrency, aka Non Fungible Tokens or NFTs, have made artists and painters multi-millionaires, practically overnight!)\nArt enables us to display our creativity, innovativeness, our passion for novelty. People involve themselves in painting, sculpture, photography and other forms of artistic creativity because it is only then that they can let their minds soar high and their ideas ran freely in the wild. Injecting life into art forms can serve as windows to our inner worlds.\nAn important form of art is music. The existence of music is wonderful, even miraculous. “Its domain lies somewhere between thought and phenomena. Like a twilight mediator, it hovers between spirit and matter, relating to both, yet differing from each”, someone remarked of it. Indeed, music soothes our heart, calms our mind, and brings us into a world of imagination. Mozart’s serenade and concertos, Haydn’s symphonies, Tchaikovsky’s ballet music all serve the same purpose. Indeed, all art cannot never be regarded as useless to us. In fact, Art is spirit, as well as matter. It is spirit, but spirit not subjected to the measurement of time. Similarly it is matter. but matter that can dispense with space. This magical aspect of art should be something we must treasure, and not simply label it as some pernicious and undesirable.\nArt epitomises man’s wisdom and his innate ability to put his ideas thoughts and perceptions into evocative symbols or representatives that transmit certain meaningful messages. Undoubtedly, it enhances interaction between people in the sense that people can communicate through time and space through those art pieces and works. With out art, interpersonal relationships can never be fostered, since all of people’s endeavours and pursuits would be centred or based on materialistic attainments and sati faction. Therefore, art is useful to us in that it closes the gap and fills up the chasm between people, thus bringing them together. Of course, one need not be sensitive, erudite or have the minds or eyes of a connoisseur to appreciate art. In fact, art is all around us, and even in its most pristine and simplest form, it can make us realize that there is a value to living, depending only on whether we are observant or not. Thus, art has a value and that value often manifests itself in its usefulness.\nOf course, there are some forms of art that do not enhance our lives, but have detrimental effects on us. Examples of these are pornography and unhealthy drawings, caricatures and portrayals that are done for defamatory or inflammatory purposes or to arouse and stimulate those undesirable feelings latent in us. In addition, decadent music will lead to degeneracy that have adverse psycho logical influences on the individual. These forms of art should definitely not be encouraged and propagated among the masses. But they constitute only a minor portion of all those things encompassed in the realm and sphere of art. Oscar Wilde’s “All art is useless” is certainly an overstatement and implies an attitude too intransigient. The word ‘Art’ and its contents should not be seen as totally useless or even sordid just because some forms of art are useless, or are to some extent, undesirable due to the fact that their degree of utilization is limited and their nature questionable.\nSince art has been passed on from one generation to generation another, it is apparent to us that unless it possesses certain qualities that are worth preserving, it could not have became the legacy of mankind. With due consideration to this, should we look at the picture from a broad perspective and recognise its real value and use fulness instead of combing it inch by inch for its flaws and stigmas?"

                "prompt": "Examine whether “the weaker sex” is an appropriate description of women today.",
                "text": "The weaker sex can be defined as the sex that is less independent, less able to look after themselves and makes less of a contribution to the society than the dominant sex. In the past, men were looked upon as the dominant sex and thus they have always had many advantages over women, especially since traditional beliefs depict women as being weaker. Even today, women are still seen as the weaker sex, in the physical, psychological, economical and political aspects.\nResearch in biological science has testified that women are born with more fat than muscles. Hence, women are physically less strong than men, with female weightlifters and samsui women being possible exceptions. In a sense, therefore, women lose out to men in jobs that re quire physical strength since they are less capable of doing strenuous work. Moreover, nature has it that women are the ones to give birth, and during the gestation period of nine months, women experience general discomfort and tire easily. This may in turn affect their work performance. In addition, women have to suffer pain during child bearing and they usually have to rest for a few days after child-birth before they are fit enough to work again. Of course, this could mean that women can endure pain much better than men. However, modern women often rely on medicine (painkillers) during child-birth and many prefer to have an operation instead of having the baby delivered naturally, so in actual fact, they do not have to endure much pain. Another aspect of the physical weak ness of women is that, except in Israel, women are not required to do National Service, thus leading people to think that women are physically less strong than men. Female weightlifters have proven that women can be as strong as men through training but few women are willing to give up their feminine image for a muscular body.\nBesides being physically weaker than men, women are also psychologically weaker than men. Women are generally more sensitive and softer hearted than men. Hence, they may tend to mix feelings with work. As a result, women may lose out in business as they tend to sympathize with others too much. No doubt, there are women who are skilful in business but they are a minority and most of them are under a glass ceiling at work as they are considered the weaker sex and men are generally unable to accept female superiors. The fact that women give in to their emotions more readily has thus become a perceived setback to women’s careers. Another psychological weakness of women is that they are more prone to depression. Moreover, women have a higher suicide rate than men. Women are better at establishing good relationships with others and this may help in their work but on the whole, women are still the weaker sex in a psychological sense.\nTradition has it that women do not have to work. Even today, this idea is deep-rooted in many people’s minds and therefore fewer women than men work and thus women make a smaller economic contribution to the country and to their families. In the Third World countries, women usually work for more hours than men but despite this fact, they are still seen as the weaker sex as they are paid very little for their work, that is, if they are paid at all. In certain countries such as India, traditional marriage customs have it that the woman’s family has to pay a huge dowry to the husband for the husband to take care of the wife, indicating that the wife is incapable of taking care of herself. In other countries such as European countries, should a marriage end in divorce, the husband is often required to pay alimony to the wife as it is thought that the wife may be unable to survive independently. For centuries, husbands were the breadwinners. Today, even though more women are going out to work, the wives still get allowances from their husbands, who felt that it is their responsibility to provide for their wives, who are the weaker sex.\nIn the past, women were not allowed to participate in politics as they were considered incapable of handling such matters. Even today, far fewer women are active in politics than men. The Prime Minister of Pakistan is one of the few. In Singapore, there is only one female member in the parliament (that has change since. Halimah was sworn in on 14 September 2017 as the 8th President at The Istana.) Much of this situation can be attributed to the sensitive and emotional nature of women which renders them less suitable candidates for politics as they are more prone to mix feelings with work. On the other hand, however, women are more caring and have keener minds which allows them to observe an issue from many different points of view and thus to make better decisions on the best action to take. However, even though women have this advantage, not many women are willing to go into politics and also few people, especially men, are able to accept female leaders. As such, women are the weaker sex.\nIn conclusion, women can be seen to be weaker than men in physical, psychological, economic and political aspects. It can also be seen that men have more advantages over women than women have over men and this is further reinforced by traditional attitudes (that women are weaker) which are still deep-rooted in most societies."

                "prompt": "“Education should be the first concern of any government.” Do you agree?",
                "text": "There is a Chinese saying “Children are the country’s cornerstone.” No matter how much a country is blessed with natural resources, its population is the ultimate force behind any economic achievement. For e tries like China and India which have plentiful amounts of natural resources to tap, their people are still much needed to use these resources to generate the growth of the economy. For countries such as Singapore and Japan which have practically no natural resources, their people are the only resource. Hence, we can see that the population is the most valuable asset of a country and I feel that a government should ensure that its people are well-educated for the benefits of economic growth.\nI agree with the view that education should be the primary concern of any government. However, not all countries around the world adopt this view. Some think that defence should be their first priority, others choose healthcare, crime control and technological improvement. Take India for example. She is the second most populous country in the world and experiencing a population boom, especially in the countryside where birth control is not common. The country devotes a great deal of attention to defence and military spending. This is not surprising since India and her neighbour, Pakistan, for years have been caught in a circle of animosity and distrust; they have fought several wars. However, I feel that the emphasis on defence is at the expense of the people’s edu cation. India is basically still an agrarian economy. Many rural children do not have the opportunity to go to school due to the lack of educational facilities in the country side where communications and infrastructure are poor. This problem is aggravated by poverty. Even if there were schools available, most children would still not stand a chance of obtaining an education as they are simply too poor to afford it. Besides, their parents prefer sending them to work in the fields to minimise the financial bur den. Things are not much better in the cities either. Al though the people are relatively wealthier and many can afford to send their children to schools, child labourers are an ubiquitous sight. In fact, India has one of the high est rates of child labour in the world. These children work. long hours daily for meagre wages. Their future looks bleak, since without any education they are unlikely to find a well-paid job when they grow up.\nIt has been shown that the Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome is spreading at a faster rate, especially in the developing countries in Africa and Asia. At the moment, no cure has been found for this disease. One of the major reasons it has infected so many people in these countries is pure ignorance. It is the rural people who are the most vulnerable to this disease since the lack of edu cation causes them to be ignorant of the ways of trans mission of AIDS. As I have mentioned in the previous paragraph, it is already hard for the rural poor to obtain a basic education about the prevention of AIDS.\nThe more developed countries definitely have a higher literacy rate than the developing ones. However, this does not mean complacency can be allowed to set in here. The government of the United States of America, for example, has realised that it is now time to do something about its educational system which is plagued with a drop in standards. Critics have condemned the system in which students are assessed using multiple choice questions which they say do not fully test the students’ abilities and intelligence.\nI see the need for governments to let education be their first concern. In the case of developing countries like India, the government should ensure that education is available and affordable for the young. They should improve the infrastructure in the rural areas so that the poor can easily reached by teachers and so schools can be built. A large pool of illiterate young people is inevitably detrimental to the economy and progress of the nation. It is also a waste of human resources. Developed nations with established educational systems should constantly seek to upgrade and improve these systems. In this way, countries will always be able to have well-educated and quality labour forces to assist in economic development and nation building."

                "prompt": "Discuss the contribution of teachers to Man.",
                "text": "Teachers can be found in every country and society. They are found in various fields, imparting skills and knowledge. widespread presence indicates their importance to mankind, for indeed, teachers contribute to the welfare of mankind in various ways.\nTeachers are important in the development of the mind. They are important in delivering knowledge in the class rooms. Facts and discoveries throughout the ages are imparted to the young and even the old, allowing the in crease of knowledge. But perhaps more importantly, the teacher provides guidance in the way to think. Classroom teaching stimulates the mind to think and develop, and the teacher plays the important role of encouragement and guidance. This is especially important for young children and teenagers who become equipped with the ability to think independently through such developments. What the teacher does for mankind is not just to impart knowledge but also to stimulate thinking so that the mind develops, and perhaps this results in the discovery of new ideas. This definitely benefits mankind and society. (In fact, with Google, internet, search engines and YouTube, we are capable of learning knowledge on our own. It is the thinking skills that will set us apart, namely critical thinking, creative thinking, systemic and systematic thinking!)Teachers prepare the young for the adult world, helping and guiding them as they grow. The ability to think independently is part of the life skills which a teacher helps a child develop. Such skills prepare the child for a time when he has to leave the protection of his parents and teachers. The young also gain the necessary knowledge for their future occupations. After all, no one is born a doctor or a lawyer. Even a teacher himself had to be taught in order to become one. Thus, in this way, EDUCATORS prepare the young for the adult world and ensure the continued survival of mankind.\nSome teachers may also guide in the development of the body. Although sports are generally regarded as an area where natural talents are inherently important, guidance is still important and here, the teacher comes in. For the development of the body and maintenance of a healthy lifestyle, sport is important. Everyone needs some basic guidance in the use of various sports equipment. The health and fitness of the layman is enhanced by the guidance of teaching professionals. Even athletes and sportsmen required coaching to develop their inborn talents. In this way. teachers in the field of sports develop the body, and benefit mankind.\nAs in sports, the arts and music need a certain amount of talent. But the role of teachers, as in sports, is not only. to guide the general public towards appreciation and some basic knowledge of the arts and music, but also to help those with special talents. The naturally gifted, teaching others, can also impart their experiences and this ensures that their talents do not die with them but continue. to contribute to the welfare of mankind. Speaking from personal experience, I know that my piano instrcutor is constantly guiding and developing my musical knowledge and skills. What she provides is not just guidance but also assistance in the discovery of my capabilities. There are thousands of people in the world, benefiting from the guidance of their teachers. And considering that the in fluence of one teacher may lead to that student’s subsequent coaching and training of another person, there is no telling how far skills and knowledge can be imparted. Indeed, one is reminded of the Singapore Government slogan in the recruitment of teachers – “Teach. You never know where your influence ends.”\nIn our modern age of technology, one may find accountants and other occupations gradually being replaced by computers. But a computer can neve replace a teacher, just as a book can never equal the knowledge delivered by a living person. The teacher provides the real-life, personal touch in the communication of knowledge. Moreover, even modern ideas of technology require a teacher to impart them to the general public. Through the spread of modern technology, society develops and mankind’s welfare is again benefited.\nTeachers may also play a role in the bringing together of mankind around the world – the creation of a global village. They are necessary to increase communication between people, for example, by the teaching of various languages. Only then can mankind around the world communicate. As I mentioned before, technology is also in directly enhanced by teaching. There is no end to the benefits mankind can gain from the development of technology. Better communications enable people around the world to come together in discussions of world issues, such as the environment and peace. These definitely benefit mankind and teachers play an indirect role in bringing about these changes and developments.\nPerhaps the most widely recognised contribution of teachers to the welfare of mankind, however, remains. their influence on the young, particularly in schools. The importance of education is widely recognised. And in our modern society where working parents spend little time with their children, the contributions of teachers have gone beyond the imparting of knowledge. They now in fluence children’s characters, attitudes and ideas. In a way, teachers have in part taken over the role of the parents in the development of the young. Thus, their influence on and contribution to mankind are great. Even in developing countries, teachers play the important role of spreading new knowledge and ideas and help in the development of the nation. The contribution of teachers to man kind’s welfare cannot be denied.\nTeachers definitely play a very important role in society. Indeed, their contributions are found everywhere, for teachers influence mankind and contribute to an endless spread of influence from generation to generation. Thus, the contribution of teachers to the welfare of mankind is a never-ending and important one."

                "prompt": "Consider the impact of advertising.",
                "text": "Advertisements are one thing that the world, or the industrialised part of the world at least, has in common. Countries from North America to India can boast of at least one form of them, from slick, multi-million dollar advertising blitzes to a simple billboard looming over a shanty town.\nAdvertising has ingrained itself so well into our lives that few can escape its influence. G.K. Chesterton once said: “Advertisements…(have been) more successful at brain-washing large masses of people than many of the great dictators of our time.” Well put, for what other aspect of life is more responsible for affecting us all psychologically than advertising? None.\nWhile it may exaggerating a little to say that advertisements are responsible for creating lasting and dam aging complexes in our susceptible minds, the fact that every single human being who has come into contact with them has been influenced by them one way or the other, is undeniable. A simple advertisement pushing the claims of Skippy Peanut Butter can make a mother feel insecure and guilty. The jingle, which tunefully proclaims: “We love peanut butter, Skippy is the one. That’s what mummy gives us, for she’s a loving mum,” insinuates that the mother is cruel and hard-hearted if she does not rush out to buy the much-loved and chock-full-of-nutrition pea nut butter for precious children. This may sound a little far-fetched, but think of how sales of Brand’s Essence of Chicken shoot up during examination time. This is all due to the powerful impact that advertising has on our lives.\nAdvertising is primarily meant to attract as many customers as possible to buy or use the product or service offered, but at what price? The incessant bombardment of slick, appealing sales images has led many an unwary consumer to judge more and more by appearances. The emphasis is now on style, not substance. Consumers now purchase the product that is packaged in a more attractive manner, passing over other products of similar, or sometimes even superior quality, just because they do not look as appealing.\nThis phenomenon has many worrying implications. A recent article in “USA Today”, an American periodical, stated that one of the major reasons Clinton won the Presidency was because he was more attractively pack aged (saxophone, blond wife, youthful looks and all) than older and more haggard-looking Bush. Among some of the reasons given for this prevailing emphasis on appearances was the impact that slick, glossy, stylish advertising has on the American population. So now you see how sinister advertising can be.\nMany people claim that advertising is an extremely wasteful industry. To some extent this is very true. With out all that money spent on air-time, research, and hiring of expensive models to advertise products and services, we consumers would pay a much lower price for the things we buy. Also, think of the adverse impact excessive packaging has on the environment. Valuable re sources are used wastefully to make a product look just a little bit better, and end up in landfills or incinerators.\nAdvertising, a multi-million industry, provides a basic function for several thousand people world-wide: that is jobs. For every hundred people that advertisements manipulate there is one bread-winner or wage-earner. Advertising is not as simple as enticing consumers to purchase a product it has a significant impact on the economy too!\nIf advertising can have an adverse impact on many consumers, it can also have a positive effect on more discerning people. What else provides the valuable lesson – beware of cheats and deceivers – day in day out? Advertising is a constant reminder to be more wary of insufficiently backed claims and stylish deviousness. People who learn these lessons well can make more intelligent choices and decisions in all areas of their lives.\nSo we see that advertising, in all its forms, makes a gigantic impact on our daily lives. Who would have thought that advertising would have such a wide-reaching and lasting influence?"

                "text": "Frankly, I have always enjoyed reading comics and if given the opportunity, I would set up a comics exhibition consisting of daily newspaper comic strips, as well as comic books with their crime-fighting epics. Though certain people may feel that they are too mature to be reading comics and may even consider comics as worthless, I still feel that reading comics is a good habit and there are also many good reasons why they ought to be exhibited.\nFirstly, comics are important and deserve to be exhibited because they are able to reflect the changing times of our world. During the First and Second World Wars, comics often depicted tales of derring-do into enemy territories as well as the intrusion of energy spies into the country. Characters like Captain America fought the Nazis and embodied the soldiers’ attitudes towards the war. During the Cold War period, the subject matter of the comics gradually evolved from actual battles on the battlefield to espionage involving modern technology like computers and laser beams. Communism was also an other main theme depicted during that time. Hence, I choose to exhibit comics because they are truly important as they chronicle the different periods of our world.\nComics are also important because they reflect the maturing of human society. In the 1940’s, the characters depicted in the comics were usually two-dimensional. The stories of Superman and Batman of that era always show them winning their battles over evil criminals. The superheroes of that era always get over their difficulties and triumph. However, beginning in the late 1960’s, the genre of comics began to evolve. The stories started to have more depth and far-reaching plots. Superman got engaged to Lois Lane and was also killed last year. Bat man broke his back and retired temporarily. The superheroes of our time are more mortal and down-to earth, than those of the 1940’s. The present superheroes reflect a time when human beings are more aware of their places in this world. We understand that everyone is born equal and everybody, including Superman, has their own problems. Hence, comics ought to be read by everyone and a good way of spreading the benefits of comic reading is by having an exhibition.\nAnother benefit of comics is that they deal with is sues plaguing humanity. Issues of racism, crime and. America’s Generation X are constantly being raised. Take the X-men for example, When the series first began, in the sixties the word “superhero” did not exist. Instead, these people with special powers were known as mutants, or X-men. The word “superhero” later came into being with the creation of Spiderman. The X-men consist of a group of mutants that are feared by their friends and families, who do not understand what they are. Besides fighting crime and villains, the X-men depict characters trying to find acceptance in a world that rejects them. Com pare these characters to refugees or perhaps that lonely. child in school, there certainly is a great similarity.\nFurthermore, comics also depict today’s Generation. X. These young people are living in a time when culture is at a rock-bottom level and hope seems to be scarce. The readers of today’s era find the comic superheroes, besides fighting against crime, battling against odds for a better future, for love and for their own home and fam ily. The superheroes give a sense of purpose and duty to their readers. Hence, such great benefits must be enjoyed by more people around us and a way to do this is by holding an exhibition.\nOn top of that, comics serve to teach by satirising human behaviour. Take Garfield, for example. Its creator, Jon Davis, is actually satirising the “typical” fat American who lazes at home. Another comic script, “Born Loser,” shows that whatever one does is not always the best and defeat is part of human nature. Comics can also serve as a form of escapism, instead of drugs and alcohol. Therefore, comics are definitely what I would choose to put up for display if given the opportunity to do so.\nIn conclusion, to enable everyone to benefit from the reading of comics and most importantly, to enjoy reading comics, I would certainly choose comics as my exhibit."

                "prompt": "What important factors would you consider when choosing a job for your career?",
                "text": "The choice of a job, I feel, is one of the important decisions a person makes in life. Apart from being one’s rice bowl, it also establishes one’s niche, role and status in society. It is the period of time when one is able to apply all that has been learnt in all one’s years of education and is a good opportunity to show one’s capability in society.\nIn choosing a job, I would, first and foremost, con sider my interest in the job. I feel that personal interest in the job overrides high pay and good employee benefits. Even though the job was demanding. I would enjoy it because I was interested in it and this is what I feel is most important to sustain my enthusiasm for the job in the long run. The job must also give a personal sense of satisfaction, so that I may achieve a goal or help serve the society in some way. This, I believe, would propel me to greater heights of achievement and I would be more enthusiastic in carrying out the work for the job.\nThe next factor I would consider would be the working environment. The working environment must be motivating, encouraging or even pressurizing at times. I feel that the working environment also plays a part in a person’s attitude towards his job. A good working environment pushes a person to perform his job well and encourages him to strive for further achievement.\nAnother factor I would consider are the promotional opportunities that the job offers. A promotion serves as an encouragement for me to continually improve and up grade my skills. It would also motivate me to work hard in order to scale the corporate ladder. It would also establish my position and role, not just in the company, but also in society. It would give me a great sense of satisfaction to know that the hard work I had put into the job had been acknowledged and recognised. It would also serve as a reminder to me that there are greater heights to be reached.\nI would also consider the position of the company in society. The company should be recognised and well established in society as I feel that this is the basis for a stable job. Working in a well-established company would definitely give me a sense of security and would put me in the right frame of mind to continue to serve the company. The employer, I feel, is another factor to be considered. The employer, must be understanding, encouraging, but at the same time should kick me when I need it. An employer must exhibit leadership qualities and show himself capable. He should serve as a role model to me and make me want to learn from him.\nI would also want a job that would allow me to apply what I have learnt in my years of education. This is so that what I have learnt would not go to waste but instead, through the job, I would learn how to apply the knowledge accumulated through the years. As the saying goes, “Education is a lifelong process.” The job should offer courses in upgrading skills, or talks and seminars on how to improve in my job. The job should also be accompanied by overseas assignments so that I would be able to widen my knowledge and to apply my skills in a broader context.\nThe pay, is also another factor that should be considered. The pay should fit the job. That is, the pay should tally with the amount of effort I put into the job. This would give me a sense of worth and help me to see that the hard work I put into the job is worthwhile. The company should also provide benefits like housing loans, medical and urgent affairs leave, transportation and medical benefits. Since some of the basic needs are already provided by the company, I would be able to divert more attention to my work and would be more dedicated to serving the company.\nThe last factor I would consider would be the distance from my home. I do not wish to spend too much time on travelling. Having to leave home early in the morning and not returning till dusk, would leave very little time for myself.\nThere are many factors that I would have to consider when choosing a job. Most importantly, however, I hope that my job will help contribute to society in some way or another."

                "prompt": "Discuss the benefits of doing volunteer work.",
                "text": "Volunteer work is a very sensitive issue in the modern world. At a time when lifestyles are hectic, money is desperately needed to maintain a high standard of living. and no-one has time for family or even for oneself, why do volunteer work?\nIndeed, volunteer work requires much sacrifice of one’s time and energy. It is hard work and seems to reap little reward. True, volunteer work does not reap financial returns, but there are rewards resulting from this work, depending on how one looks at things. Cliched as it may sound, volunteer work provides satisfaction of the soul and mind. It develops the “inner man” rather than catering to the material or physical needs of a person. It is these unseen benefits that motivate the volunteer worker.\nVolunteer work is needed in homes such as old folks’ homes, children’s homes and the homes for the handicapped. We should keep these in mind as we analyze the motivating factors behind volunteer work.\nAs I mentioned earlier, volunteer work brings inner satisfaction to the soul. Not everyone may be able to experience this, but those who are, are able to derive joy just from seeing the pained faces of elderly folks break into a smile. Helping the handicapped child in physiotherapy classes and watching him finally take one independent step, can make a great difference in one’s life. Volunteer work does not dwell on the rewards the world desires, but is able to generate rewarding joys such as these.\nVolunteer work also helps to develop one’s character and personality. It builds patience too. Helping the elderly perform tasks which can be easily done by the nor mal person, can be exasperating at times. This requires a great amount of love, care and patience which cannot be developed overnight. Moreover, the moods of handicapped persons may take drastic turns, and one needs to be able to adapt easily. Volunteer work requires a lot, but seems to provide little. However, it is this process of learning to care for and help others who may never reciprocate, that really develops the inner qualities of a person. For some this may be reward enough.\nConstant exposure to those who desperately rely on others for help, and are dependent, will eventually lead to a greater understanding of mankind. No longer will we be frustrated with those who are less capable than us, but instead we will be willing to reach out a helping hand.\nVolunteering our services and work of love brings love and hope to the lives of others as well as to ourselves. In some cases, old folks may have been abandoned by their children, and as a result become depressed and disillusioned with life. We may not be able to solve their problem, but at least, our very presence may be able to provide the support and comfort they need. Similarly, orphans, deprived of a fam ily unit and the proper love and warmth which a family brings, need our concern and care for them. This brings rewards that cannot be measured.\nIn addition to this, we may be able to experience the pure and unconditional love that these unfortunate people may have to offer. They have no-one to share their love with, and we may as a result be the fortunate recipients of this love.\nIt may be considered in society that volunteer work reaps no rewards. It is all hard work and no satisfaction. Indeed this view is very wrong. Volunteer work is hard and needs great effort and patience, but the rewards it brings are immeasurable."

                "prompt": "One man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. Do you agree?",
                "text": "The word “terrorist” tends to evoke in people, the visual image of a dirty looking, unshaven thug, usually of Arabic or Palestinian nationality, carrying a M-16 rifle in one hand, and a grenade in the other. But if we were to look beyond the stereotype of the terrorist, and try to understand and search for the causes behind his actions, we would find that they can sometimes be viewed as “freedom fighters.” I believe that, yes, one man’s terrorist can be another man’s freedom fighter.\nTerrorist groups are formed usually by people who seek justice for what they feel has been injustice done to them. They want to kill, but that is the means, not the aim. The goal is to openly display and announce their rebellion and protests by spreading fear and shock on a massive scale, to instill a sense of helplessness. Groups such as the Irish Republican Army, Hamas, or the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam are examples of such terrorists. In the hearts of the people these terrorists are fighting for, the initial emotion is that of pride and gratitude: pride that their own people are standing up for their rights and are making their protest heard; gratitude that these terrorists are brave and selfless enough to make such a sacrifice to fight for their own people. For instance, the terrorist group Hamas was formed in February, 1988, just after the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza strip. Initially, beyond spreading anti-Israeli propaganda, it focused its efforts on social, religious and welfare programs for Palestinians. This won Hamas tremendous support among the oppressed Palestines living in those areas, who felt that the terrorists were fighting for a righteous cause, and for the good of all Palestinians.\nHowever, its ultimate goal was much more deadly. aimed to destroy Israel and create its own Muslim theocracy in what used to be British Palestine as a prelude to a pan-Arab Islamic state. To the rest of the world, such a goal is unreasonable and frightening, for hundreds of lives would have to be sacrificed for the purpose of achieving it. Suicide bombers alone from Hamas have claimed the lives of at least 377 victims. Yet, such warriors who are killed are seen by the by the Palestinians as heroes, people who are so courageous that they are willing, and almost eager, to die for their beliefs. Therefore, the support for these “freedom fighters” grows with each Hamas fighter executed or killed by the Israelis. Further frustration at the miserable state of the economy in the Gaza strip has also fuelled the support for Hamas, for the people believe that they can enjoy an improvement in living standards only if the fighters win the war against the common enemy, Israel. Thus, although the world sees Hamas as an extremely dangerous and serious threat, this same group of people enjoys the sup port of at least one-third of the 1.8 million Palestinians living in that area.\nSome terrorists also aim to destroy the leadership in their country. The citizens may feel that the government is not worthy of their respect for various reasons, such as corruption within the government, or dictatorship by a ruthless ruler. These people have little or no means to voice their disapproval or show their displeasure at the government, for it is the ruling party which will have the final say, regardless of what the people want. Thus, some groups choose to resort to terrorism to eliminate the leadership in the country, and to highlight their sufferings under such a government to the whole world. The people who support these terrorists view them as fighters who are out to destroy the bad to replace them with the good, although what is actually “good” for the country may not be everyone’s piece of cake. These people are tired of suffering under bad leadership, and back the terrorists because theirs is a promise of change and improvement. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Jaffna, a north eastern province of Sri Lanka, have killed more than a dozen political and military leaders in the past three years. Ethnic riots in 1983 killed 2000 Tamils, and this pro found sense of Tamil grievance has helped the Tigers retain support. The Tamils feel discriminated against by the Sinhalese – dominated south, and feel that one of the solutions to ending such ethnic tension is to set up an autonomous state called Tamil Eelam for the Tamils.\nWe tend to view such acts of terror, ruthless murder and total disregard for human life as being revolting and sense less, but the number of pro-terrorist demonstrations in countries like Sri Lanka and in the West Bank and Gaza strip shows us that these terrorists actually enjoy support among their people.\nHowever, terrorist groups run the risk of losing their support. This could happen when the actions they take are seen as being too extreme, or when years of war and privation take their toll. The struggle in Ulster is increasingly viewed with a sense of disgust. Not only would the British government welcome the chance to bring its troops home from North ern Ireland, the majority of the people in Northern Ire land itself, be they Roman Catholic or Protestant, would simply like to get on with their lives. These people have endured 25 years of terrorism and bombings, and some have never known a normal life. Sights of armed soldiers patrolling the area have become common, and even a way of life.\nPublic support for the Irish Republican Army in the United States, mainly due to sympathy for the Irish, has diminished as well, largely due to growing revulsion at their killings. United States government officials say that contributions to the IRA have dwindled to a mere $200 000 a year, compared to millions a few years ago. This goes to show that the image of terrorists being noble “freedom fighters” can slowly change as years go by, and little or no progress is achieved using strong-arm measures. The heavy cost of providing such groups with arms, and the massive toll on property and human life can cause people to think twice about supporting the terrorists. In Sri Lanka, many of Jaffna’s remaining 600, 000 residents are weary of the war, but are afraid to speak out, aware of the Tiger habit of carrying out “lamppostings”, street executions in which the bullet-riddled bodies of dissenters are left with signs labelling them traitors. In such cases, the “freedom fighters” no longer have great support from the people, who now view them as being ruthless terrorists.\nA terrorist is not a terrorist in the eyes of the people he defends, at least, before his actions take a toll on public support. These people may be motivated by the desire for vengeance or strong religious beliefs to defend the actions of the terrorists as they believe they are fighting for a righteous cause. However, if we do not try to under stand the sentiments of such people, it is all too easy to dismiss terrorists as being frantic, deranged killers. Al though the world may disapprove of terrorists and the means which they use to achieve their aims, it remains a fact that such terrorists still exist today partly due to the support from the people, who feel that they are noble and brave, and who view them as martyrs, or “freedom fighters.”"

                "prompt": "Is a world without racial conflicts an impossible dream?",
                "text": "When we consider man’s war-torn history, his cur rent actions and his nature, a world without racial conflicts seems an impossible dream. For such a world to evolve, would mean that man had controlled his baser instincts completely and all the problems of the world had vanished. Even then the evolution of such a world could not be guaranteed.\nA race will become hostile to other races when they are not doing as well as the other races and have lost every source of national pride. They will then turn in ward and convince themselves that the other races are responsible for their plight. This describes the situation of the German people immediately after World War I exactly. At that stage, they had lost their proud navy and the army was vastly reduced, they had to spend a lot of money annually to service a war indemnity so large they could never hope to pay it and their government had proven to be an ineffective one. Hitler took advantage of this, convincing them that they, the Aryans had natural dominance over the other races and this started one of the most horrifying wars in the history of mankind.\nSince one race will always be ahead of another and jealousy is always inevitably present, the possibility of a racial conflict is never far away. If the jealousy between the races becomes too strong, all it takes is a glib-tongued, power-hungry man to turn the relatively harmless situation into a racial conflict.\nA world without racial conflict is an impossible dream because of man’s basic desire to have control over others. of his kind. This has been proven historically by the existence of slavery, in which the race of the master has absolute power over the race of the slaves. Even when slavery was made illegal, the “slave race” was still con trolled by the “master race” and when this balance was upset, racial conflict ensued. This is shown by the activities of the Ku Klux Klan in the United States of America, against the African-Americans in the early half of this century. It is shown by the numerous lynchings of black people in the southern states of the USA whenever these men tried to improve their lot. It is apparent even today when a Ku Klux Klan member was recently elected as governor of Louisiana, with the public knowing fully whom they were electing.\nOne of the reasons why racial conflicts are unlikely to end is the fact that almost every person has been raised believing that his race is better than the rest. This form of racial prejudice can be so subtle that the person may not even realize it himself. These half-submerged attitudes arise once people feel that they are being discriminated against and they fight back against the perceived attacks. For instance, Chinese-Indonesians feel that they are dis criminated against because they are Chinese, while native Indonesians feel that they are exploited by their middle-class Chinese employers. It is a no-win situation. No matter what is done to help, the action may be seen as an added insult to either party and the possibility of conflict becomes even higher. In Singapore, this is clearly illustrated in the racial riots of the 1950s. Even today, the prejudice and conflicts are still present, though much more subtle. Malays are still stereotyped as lazy, the Chinese, as materialistic beyond redemption and the Indians are still generally looked down upon. I am not saying that the situation is explosive and ripe for conflict but I am just saying that the various prejudices are still present.\nEvidence of racial conflicts is rampant today. For many of these conflicts, their reasons stretch back many decades. For instance, the carnage in Rwanda started when the French colonialists long ago allowed one race, the Tutsis, to rule the other. When the French left, civil war broke out with one race, the Hutus, wanting to avenge the wrongs done to it by the ruling race during the years of French colonialism and to gain power and with the Tutsis trying to keep their power, even at the cost of sacrificing their own people to win sympathy and support. The hotspot in Bosnia can be traced all the way back to the beginning of this century when the breakup of the old Ottoman Empire left many smaller states hungry for more land and power. The “forgotten war” in the Nagorno Karabakh area can be traced to the former USSR’s policy of resettling people away from their native homelands to alleviate its problems with the various nationalities.\nAs can be seen, the roots of these racial conflicts lie deep in history. It would take a long time and a lot of sustained effort to resolve these problems. Meanwhile, the seeds for future racial conflicts would be sown and these would erupt in the future.\nTo conclude, living in a world devoid of racial conflicts does seems to be an impossible dream. It is inherent in man’s nature to want power over others and to be prejudiced against other races or jealous of their progress. This was obvious even at the very dawn of mankind when one tribe would routinely attack another for the simple reason that they were different and there was plunder to be had. The roots of such conflicts are also too deep and complicated to be resolved. It would take too much time and effort from too many parties, most of which would be reluctant to help unless it was to their direct advantage. Thus, I do think that the possibility of such a world existing is a very dim one. Even if it were to exist, it would be only in the very distant future."

                "prompt": "From your own experience, how would you define the pleasures of reading?",
                "text": "When I was young, one of my hobbies was reading. Whenever I had the time, I would climb onto a comfort able sofa and read. My reading diet, then, consisted of books by Enid Blyton, Roald Dahl and Noel Streatfield. When I read, I would be totally oblivious to the rest of the world, having been transported by my books to other places: a chocolate factory, a ballet school and circuses. As I grew older, I graduated to poetry and plays, Poetry especially appealed to me – I am always fascinated at how ideas of great magnitude can be effectively conveyed in such concise pieces of writing. Through these years, I have always derived enormous amounts of pleasure from reading.\nReading is extremely pleasurable as firstly, it provides intellectual stimulation to the readers. This is unlike the television or the radio, where information provided can he absorbed only passively by people, as no time is al lowed for reflection. Reading various different books has provoked me to think of social, religious and scientific issues. Arthur Miller’s “After The Fall” has made me reflect on communism. In the play, the main character is persecuted for being a communist and his struggle to cope with condemnations of being evil, as he is a communist, and his genuine belief in communism make me rethink my prejudiced view of communists as cold-blooded and cruel, power-hungry people. I saw that some communists could have truly believed in the ideology and it was their compassion for the under trodden.   Another book, Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot” has posed many religious questions to me. As a Chris tian, I feel that the book has caused me to think of whether my waiting for the Messiah’s return is as futile as that of the two main characters in the play. Such a question has benefited me as after exploring this question, my belief in God has been strengthened.\nSecondly, reading allows me to escape from my troubles and problems by forgetting these through comic relief and involvement in my reading. Thus, this provides me with a way of coping with stress and loneliness. Reading thrillers and horror stories in particular, helps me to escape from the monotony of life. When I read horror stories, I easily get involved in the stories, due to the feelings of fear I experience on reading such stories. Such emotional involvement makes me feel that I am really encountering what is happening in the stories. One example is Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Tell-Tale Heart” in which 1, in reading it, seemed to be in the same room as the lunatic, observing his murdering the old man. Thrillers normally do not have such an effect on me, but Jeffrey Archer’s “A Matter of Honour” was so intriguing that. I became entirely caught up in the events of the story and forgot everything round me.   Thirdly, one of the joys of reading is that it furnishes me with knowledge. This is not in reference only to non fiction but also to fiction. From my books, I have learnt about social issues, history, science, politics and even about survival. “Whispers” by Belva Plain has highlighted the problem of wife-battering. Through this novel, I realise that wife-bashers need not be blue-collar drunkards but also highly paid executives who still love their wives. I also saw the difficulties for a woman to leave her husband for this reason, the most important difficulty being that of love on the woman’s part for the husband still.\nI learnt also about the history of China from 1909 to 1978 through Jung Chang’s “Wild Swans” and in particular, the political structure of the government after 1949 and the atrocities Mao Ze Dong committed i indirectly, to secure his own position as dictator. In addition, I acquired knowledge of the British political system by perusing Jeffrey Archer’s “First Among Equals” and was s exposed to a stark prediction of what would happen to the world if a nuclear war occurred, in John Wyndham’s “Chrysalids”. Through a story set during the Revolutionary War, “The Island of the Blue Dolphins” by Scott O’Dell, I discovered how the American Indians lived their lives in the past.\nFourthly, reading is pleasurable as it helps me to be better able to relate to people. In reading, we are taught to understand the sufferings and problems other people have, which we may never have the opportunity to experience in our real life. For example, Wilfred Owen’s war poems like “Disabled” and “Dulce et decorum est” help us to realize the feelings of futility people feel towards the war and the psychological and physical damage done to soldiers in combat. Another example is “Grapes of Wrath” (John Steinbeck), a story set in the 1930s, in America, which revolves around a family from Oklahoma who migrated to California for employment. The story exposes us to poor-paying jobs, great poverty, the need to struggle and fight with others to survive and disdain shown by the rich, towards the poor.\nIn studying any book, we would feel for different characters differently, either sympathising, empathising or having antipathy towards them. This aids us in relating to the people around us as when we read more, our sympathy becomes more easily evoked and thus, in real life, we are also able to feel more easily for others. Extreme, evil characters also assist us in tolerating people who are unpleasant as one compares the latter with the former.   The fifth reason why reading is so pleasurable is be cause reading encourages imagination and creativity. One example is John Wyndham’s “Chocky” which urges us to imagine a world where aliens can enter one’s minds to educate us. In this novel, Wyndham provides creative rea sons as to why aliens would want to occupy an earth ling’s brain and refreshing alternatives to conventional ways of doing things.\nUndeniably, not all the books published would give us such pleasures in reading. Some novels have a weak plot, incredible characters and situations and worse of all, are written simply to pander to the baser instincts in mankind: sex and violence. This is notwithstanding the fact that such books do provide readers with some kind of satisfaction, though this is different from the kinds of satisfaction received from reading other kinds of literature. Yet, this kind of pleasure is one which we can do without as it does not benefit us in any other way except for a fleeting moment of delight.   To reiterate, reading does bring tremendous amounts of enjoyment, yet not all the enjoyment elicited from reading may be of the positive kind. The world of books offers endless hours of positive, pleasant and varied amusement to people who can read with ease. Let us strive to get the most out of our readings."

                "prompt": "“A good book is a good friend.” How far do you agree?",
                "text": "“A good book is a good friend”, but just what makes a good book or a good friend? I feel that, regardless of whether Joseph Conrad or Enid Blyton wrote it, a good book is one which fulfils the role of a good friend. A good friend is one who can build one up, give support, give advice, someone who is fun to be with and, of course, available when I need them. With these points in mind, I shall illustrate how good books can fulfil these roles and hence be good friends.   A good book can build a person up mentally, spiritually, morally or psychologically.\nBooks like encyclopedias or the numerous academic books by archaeologists or physicists, like Stephen Hawking’s “Black Holes and the Universe”, can broaden our minds’ horizons and give us sometimes a brand new perspective on the world. The book acts much like a good friend telling us about things we would not normally concern ourselves with, such as astrophysics. Other books both factual and fiction can build us up spiritually or morally. The Bible teaches many universal values such as love and tolerance. Isaac Asimov too explores certain moral issues, often through robots and their adventures. Piers Anthony does the same too, especially in his “Incarnations of Immortality” series. The books act as a friend discussing his or her views about certain subjects and in the process we pick up moral values which we feel are good for us. Psychologically, books can prepare us with the knowledge of situations or problems we have never come across. When we read about such issues, which Paul Zindel likes to write about in books such as “Excuse Me, You’re Stepping On My Eye ball”, we think about what we would do in such situations with our father or girlfriends. It is quite like listening to a friend talk about his or her problems.   Books can be a great source of support when we are depressed. Many people I know read humorous books to cheer themselves up. Many religious people look to their scriptures for spiritual help and divine assurance.\nPersonally, I often feel much better after reading a witty book. Authors like David Eddings have very amusing characters, who never fail to bring a smile to my face when I feel depressed. The Bible, too, is a great source of spiritual support when I have problems. All these books take the place of friends who may not be there to help and give us support in times of personal emotional or spiritual difficulties. Books can be fun to be with. There are many books written deliberately to amuse, like comic books. Other authors are exceedingly good at making everyday issues sound funny in different perspectives, like Sue Townsend’s Adrian Mole series, which is funny but at the same time fulfils a more serious role. Local examples are the “Teenage Textbook” and “Teenage Workbook.”\nThese books become friends who tell us jokes or funny incidents like our real friends do in can teens. One good and reliable thing about books is that they are truly friends who are always there for you, unless you misplace them. Once we read a book and it affects. us, we can always go back to it for whatever experience it has given us, whether it is assurance, guidance or in formation. Books are always willing and ready, which our real human friends cannot be and cannot be expected to be, realistically. I know my “Teenage Textbook” is standing on my bookshelf waiting for me to open it for an enjoyable time; I know my Bible is in my bag always within reach when I need it.\nThis attribute of books qualifies them as really good friends.   As I have shown, books can carry out the major roles of a good friend. But nevertheless we must not rely on books alone and never bother to mix socially. This, in effect, hakes books bad friends, as a good friend will never try to dominate all of our time and attention.\nPerhaps if more people realize what good friends books can be, they will find that they are not as lonely as they think. After all many things in the books are actually the author’s own experiences and thoughts. We can hear the author’s voice. Even though we are unlikely ever to meet them surely the thought that somebody else in the world could easily be a friend should comfort a lot of lonely people."

                "prompt": "Why read when you can watch a film?",
                "text": "True, there are many reasons why this is a valid question. After all, films, in the form of television and video. films or an actual cinema film are more popular than the good old paperback. Just as there are many types of books, there are many types of films: action, love and romance, comedies, serious artistic dramas and even pornography. Whatever is available in book form, can be found in film. form. So why do we still practise the seemingly archaic, time-consuming and eye-straining task of reading a three hundred page book?\nLet us look at films first. There must be many reasons films should replace books. One of the most obvious rea sons is affordability and accessibility. Films are readily available via television which is common in most developed countries. Cinemas are quite common and tickets reasonably cheap. A cinema ticket in Singapore costs only six dollars compared to at least ten dollars for a secondhand book of equivalent content, and usually at least sixteen dollars for a new one. It is therefore easier and cheaper to watch the same story or documentary at home on television or at the cinema. This is a very convincing advantage films have over books in our modern and economy conscious world.\nFilms, many would claim, are more entertaining be cause of the visual and audio experience. We may cringe and clutch a horror novel tighter at its climax but nobody. screams while reading a book as they do in the cinema with its brilliantly vivid and large images as well as sur round sound system.   In addition, films are easy to watch, enjoy and immerse oneself in. A thirteen-year-old can readily appreciate the romance as well as sadness of a film version of “Romeo and Juliet.” But push the book, even one with editing and notes like our dear literature text, to a fifteen year old in secondary three, and he or she will have trouble trying to follow the language alone!\nFurthermore, watching films can be an enjoyable social event. A group of friends or family can enjoy each other’s company while laughing their way through Jim Carey’s “Ace Ventura.” But a book can at most, and usually irritatingly, be read by three.   It would seem that there is no point in trying to justify reading in the midst of overwhelming factors on the side of watching films. But that is not the case. Books can be read just about anywhere dry and well lit. But films cannot be watched without some form of mechanical device, be it the cathode ray tube or thirty five millimetre projector. Books are usually quite light and handy. Carrying them by hand, inside a pocket or bag are all equally convenient.\nThey can fill up empty periods of time on the bus or train or simply while waiting for friends. There are few restrictions on time and place.   We can take our time reading a book and do not have to keep up with the frantic pace of some crazy scriptwriter who is trying to squeeze a thousand page story into two and a half hours. One can relax on a favourite couch, a drink and titbits by one’s side while leisurely flipping through a book, rereading when one cannot understand the first time. This is not quite possible with a movie that is not on tape. Take our eyes off and, oh no, missed some thing crucial. Life is frantic enough, and books can help us relax. We do not need stress in our leisure too!\nMany books can be just as entertaining as films in their own way. An Omnimax movie may be breathtaking but the beauty of a perfect sunrise in a photography book. leaves a lasting and deeper impression. Jim Carey, Stephen Chow and other comedians may be funny but are often senseless or witless. Many good books give a good laugh with brilliantly witty lines. Also, there is no way anybody can make a film entitled “1001 Greats Jokes”!   We must also know that a book is rarely translated completely to a film. Just take the very successful “For est Gump”, the film was excellent but deviated quite a bit from the book. Nowhere in the original book did Gump go running cross continent for three years. Often, it takes. the original book to give us a full understanding of the story. No actor can give us as clear a look into the thoughts of the character as the words of the author can.\nDue to the completeness of the original book, it can be more enthralling, more captivating than the film. Sometimes, the loud sounds and bright colours over whelm the scenes so much that all that is meaningful is lost. But a book is quiet; the only sound is our inner reading voice and imagined sounds running with the story. Reading can be an intimate thing between the reader and the story and its character. Characters from many good books I have read still feel so real to me even after reading them a long time ago. Few films can achieve this rapport.\nReading, in addition, cultivates us in ways no films can. It improves our language skills and appreciation of words. I would not be able to write half as well if not for my voracious reading, and many friends feel similarly. Films are loud, forceful and bright. Books can be all that yet gentle and refined. Books make us think too, and use our imaginations.   I love books and reading. They have done more good for me than all the films I have watched and I have watched quite a lot. Books were the building blocks of our civilisation and should watching ever replace reading, the end of human intelligence and civilisation will be nigh."

                "prompt": "Discuss the benefits of keeping a diary.",
                "text": "Someone once told me, “If you want to know a per son, just read her diary and you will know anything and everything about her.” I cannot disagree with that statement for I have kept my own personal diary for more. than a decade. And believe me, if someone did get hold of it, he or she would know me better than anyone else, and better than I would want to be known!\nThe main benefit of keeping a personal diary is that we can reveal our deepest and truest feeling towards something or somebody. There are certain things in life that cannot be shared with even our closest friends and that is when we tend to turn to our faithful old diary. Writing in my diary has lightened lots of burdens that I have faced throughout my life. When I am unsure about my feelings, I write them down. When I am ready to make my decision, I just have to sit and read whatever I have written. From that alone, I normally come to make up my mind, and most of the time I have been right. I re member the time when I was fifteen, and I had a major crush on a guy in my school.\nMy diary used to be filled with stories of him doing this and that. And when he noticed me, he asked me to be his steady girlfriend. That night, I sat and read my diary and realised that my feeings were still very superficial and I told him to give me some time. He did not. Today, he has broken many hearts and I am truly glad that mine is not one of them.   A personal diary also has made me realise how much I have grown throughout the years. Albums only give pictures, but my diary gives me feelings. Sometimes, when I sit back and read my diary, I can laugh non-stop. or even cry. When was nine, my cat died and according to my diary, I cried so much that my page was all smudged with tears. I thought I was going to die from sorrow, but I lived. When I left home for the first time to stay in a hostel when I was thirteen, again, every day my pages were filled with “Homesick…I hate school…I hate life.”\nAfter living there for five years, today, I truly miss my second home so very much. During my teenage years, three quarters of my diary was filled with crushes I had. Two weeks ago when I sat down and counted them, there were fifty eight of them! And just imagine…99% did not respond! Reaching adulthood, I have got over that stage in life and I can see that things have changed tremendously throughout the years, and so have I, thanks to my diary.   My personal diary has also made me learn to accept my flaws and sharpen my talents. I was born with the bones of my foot different from those of people around me, and this has caused me to walk in a funny way. My parents took me for physiotheraphy but it did not make it completely normal, though it did improve. People used to make fun of the way I walked, saying I walked like a duck-and some of them still do. I used to write in my diary, saying, “I don’t understand why God has to do this to me” and tearfully pity myself. Then one day when I was sixteen, I started reading my old diary and some thing came to my mind whenever I read those episodes. l realised that there are many people without legs and hands, and all I have is a little crooked leg which functions perfectly. Why was I so ungrateful? From that day, I stopped blaming God and started to take the initiative to walk straight. My mother says I have improved tremendously – and thanks again to my diary.\nI am confessing a great sin I did once, I read my mother’s diary two years ago… and believe me, I still feel so guilty about it though nobody knows. But that diary made me love her more than anything else in the whole, wide universe. My father passed away around three years ago and she kept a diary as her means of communication with him. I truly did not know she loved him so much and she was going through such deep sorrow though she put on such a brave face outside – for us she said. She felt that her only reasons for living now were for me and my sisters and nothing in the world would make her leave us, because of him. From just those few pages that I read, I learned how great a mother’s love is and how much greater it is for her husband. My mother was surprised at the change she saw in me after that I have been a wonderful daughter to her since, though she does not really know why. And when I get married, I want to be like her… and I owe it to a personal diary book, not mine in this case!   People have often wondered how I can stick to writing in my diary booklet because they say that they can only keep it up for a few days.\nI’ve had small diaries and big ones, plain and coloured ones, thick and thin ones, which have just been like my life. My diaries have always been my best friends, my most personal confidants. They have in deed gone through the best and worst times of my life with me. What I tell those people is, “stick to your diary and it will stick with you, and you’ll know why I never stop keeping one!”"

                "prompt": "Is modern technology beneficial or threatening to democracy?",
                "text": "Modern technology is prevalent in our daily lives. Technology associated with telecommunications allows us to communicate with one another with ease and speed. Such technologies have the greatest impact and influence on our beliefs and values. The public network supports numerous social media platforms which allow the general public to voice their opinions 'freely'. Assuming that we value democracy as the preferred governing system, such sharing platforms can be used to both benefit and threaten democracy. After much deliberation, I argue that modern technology largely benefits democracy and while some threats exist, they are minute and negligible.\nDemocracy is defined as a government that is elected by the people. It is a system of governance that is commonly associated with freedom – freedom of speech, freedom of thought, freedom of artistic expression, etc. In general, most people want their voices to be heard and respected. The idea of being able to achieve our goals, dreams and aspirations freely surely appeal to many people. Modern technology is beneficial to democracy only when it can help magnify the benefits of this popular system of governance. However, it can also be threatening to democracy when it starts to magnify the flaws of democracy.\nFirst, let us discuss the value of democracy. Since democracy encourages the sharing of ideas, such a system allows leaders to approach problems after taking into consideration the different perspectives offered by different parties. If alternative ideas are suppressed, leaders may be forced into making risky and unpopular decisions. Modern technology allows collaboration to take place easily over the Internet. The Singapore government is now known for using popular social media platforms such as Facebook to connect with citizens. Town Councils setup special social media accounts and collect ideas from the residents. In addition, the Internet is abuzz with activity whenever an election is about to take place. This is true not only in Singapore but in many developed nations such as Hong Kong, Japan, Switzerland and the United States. Through numerous social media platforms such as Twitter, Youtube, Facebook and Instagram, any common citizen can voice his or her opinion freely to lend support to their political parties or to support certain political ideals. When voters are highly engaged, this gives rise to a government that has strong support and thus a high level of legitimacy. Since the outcome is a positive one, one would argue that in this case, modern technology is beneficial to democracy.\nFor sure, modern technology has disrupted traditional modes of communication. Just a few decades ago, we were largely dependent on print media, television and radio for information. If such modes of communication are highly regulated by the government, then opinions tend to be suppressed. The rise of technology changes that (at least in the short-term). Many people believe that they can express themselves freely on the Internet as it remains largely unregulated. I beg to differ. The Internet is simply another mode of communication. It is a tool. If the tool is used to obstruct the government from meeting its objectives, there would surely be intervention of some form. It takes time for the policies and laws to be updated but eventually, governments will implement them. In Singapore, The Protection From Online Falsehoods and Manipulation (POFMA) took effect in year 2019 to prevent individuals from making use of the Internet to cause damage to another person's reputation simply by posting baseless accusations. Recently, wealthy youths and young adults in China were flaunting their wealth online and the Chinese were quick to recognize that this had a negative influence on the general public as such activities promote arrogance and wastage. The authorities took swift action and banned numerous social media accounts that they deemed detrimental to Chinese culture. Clearly, the belief that modern technology offers complete freedom is an illusion. Governments maintain full control. Hence, it is clear that modern technology, in reality, has limited impact and does not easily threaten the existing system of governance (be it democracy or others).\nDetractors may argue that some people may make use of the Internet to magnify the flaws of democracy and hence, cause others to lose confidence in democracy. For instance, extremists may take to the Internet to radicalize young and gullible citizens and encourage them to perform acts of terrorism. In this case, one may argue that modern technology threatens democracy because it gives rise to unruly and violent behaviour. In 2015, two adults who radicalized themselves via social media were arrested and detained in Singapore under the Internal Security Act (ISA). The ISA gives the government the power to detain individuals without trial. Although controversial, the ISA has been enforced and proven somewhat effective in weeding out potential threats that arise from the use of modern technology. Hence, confidence levels in democracy remain largely unaffected due to the presence of similar laws.\nDetractors may also use the Internet to point out egregious imperfections directly to dampen confidence in democracy. For instance, one may go online to point out that too much freedom of speech can lead to an unstable political climate. Without stability, a country is less likely to be able to continue attracting foreign investments and hence, livelihoods are at stake. By stoking fear, one may become successful in destabilizing a country. Protests could be rife in public streets. Public confidence in the elected government would plunge to an all-time low and hence, threaten democracy.\nAdmittedly, these concerns are understandable and even legitimate. However, one must not forget that although these are austere concerns, governments are taking an active interest in them. As mentioned, having no regulations at present does not mean that regulations will not come into effect in the near future. With time, governments are realizing that policies and laws need to be updated to deal with problematic concerns. In China, in the name of national security, all foreign social media platforms are banned and citizens are only allowed access to local social media platforms, which are closely monitored and highly regulated by the Chinese government. In New Zealand, the country has recently announced that it will start to regulate social media content to deal with misinformation. Again, this clearly shows that modern technology has little or no impact on a country's system of governance as it can be controlled and regulated if a government chooses to.\nIn conclusion, the rise of modern technology has given everyone additional channels to voice their opinions. In other words, we have more choices than ever. I firmly believe that technology has given democracy a boost. At times, technology may appear to threaten democracy. However, these threats can easily be curbed by incumbent governments and therefore, modern technology poses little threat to democracy."

                "prompt": "Assess the view that attempts to control climate change can never be truly effective.",
                "text": "Climate change is destroying our placeplanet. This is a common existential threat that environmentalists are claiming and spreading through media channels. As news constantly reports depressing news caused by climate change, people are becoming fatigued. We are sick and tired of being constantly bombarded by news that warn us of the dire consequences that have arrived or are about to arrive. In addition, news of regional treaties failing are also concerning and does not provide much needed optimism and encouragement that the people need. As of writing, I am of the view that attempts to control climate change are presently ineffective. However, I would not go far as to agree that controlling climate change can never be truly effective as I believe that are steps that can be taken to change the course of our future.\nFirstly, allow me to start the discussion by putting forth the pertinent example of the Kyoto Protocol. The treaty was created in 1997. It is a treaty that places heavy emphasis on developed nations to decrease carbon emissions and only developed nations are required to decrease emissions. Realistic targets to reduce emissions by 5% from 1990s levels are set. However, no specific time frames are attached to these targets. There are many inherent challenges when regional treaties come into effect. First of all, it is challenging for countries to enforce legal clauses in the treaties for fear of political backlash. Without proper incentives and penalties, governments are not motivated to hit preset targets. Secondly, participants may become \"free riders\" as they aim to exploit the sharing of funds and technology. They do so by acquiring loans at attractive interest rates and gain access to technology shared by developed nations and yet fail to meet their green targets. Due to such challenges, the Kyoto Protocol has largely been deemed a failure.\nThe regional treaty approach was recently revived through the Paris Climate Agreement, which was signed in November 2016. Recognizing the drawbacks of the previous treaties, the new agreement now aims to involve all countries. Under this treaty, countries are required to review their targets every 5 years. The main goal of the treaty is to bring down global temperatures. A clearer system is provided so that all nations can provide transparent reporting. There is also a greater emphasis on sharing of resources and technology. However, despite the revisions, I still believe that many countries are not fully committed to hitting goals due to reasons that may not be made apparent during a climate treaty meeting.\nAdmittedly, countries are concerned that their economies may be adversely affected as they aim to reduce carbon emissions. In fact, it is not unusual for industries that are threatened to protest and fight back strongly in order to protect their livelihoods and justify their existence. When our Ozone Layer was damaged, many attributed the cause to a chemical known as chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). CFC is used to produce refrigerants. Refrigerant is ubiquitous as it can be found in many consumer products such as refrigerators and air-conditioners. With such pervasive use of CFCs, experts are concerned that irreversible damage will be done to our Ozone Layer. Hence, the Montreal Protocol was established in 1989 to tackle this problem. It is a known fact that the Montreal Protocol is a successful attempt at prohibiting the use of CFCs. Why does a regional treaty such as the Montreal Protocol succeed while the Kyoto Protocol fails? I believe the answer lies in stakeholders taking up responsibility. The entire sector recognizes the harm done by CFCs. Instead of resisting, industry leaders took it upon themselves to come up with alternative solutions. In addition, the Montreal Protocol also provides clear incentives to all participants. Those who join the treaty gain market share as they are included in trade agreements. While the Paris Agreement mimics the Montreal Protocol, I have yet to see compelling evidence of countries taking up full responsibility for carbon emissions in a convincing manner. For instance, while the United States publicly declares that it aims to attain Net Zero emission status by the year 2050, the prime minister of India announces that India aims to attain the same goal only by year 2070. I shudder to think about the state of this planet if temperature continues to rise till 2070! Obviously, different countries are marching to their own drum beats and a consensus has not been reached.\nWhile we rely heavily on our leaders to bring about dramatic change to the climate, there is also increasing evidence that there is heightened awareness of global warming amid the population. Stakeholders such as celebrities who are not usually involved in climate change are starting to speak up. An evident example would be Mr. Arnold, a prominent international film star who starred in numerous Hollywood action movies. In his recent speeches, he was visibly angered by how little politicians have achieved during the past decade and he wanted to encourage people to take action and not rely fully on political leaders to effect climate change. Young activists such as Greta Thunberg are also becoming more and more outspoken and have taken to the media to voice their opinions courageously.\nI am also of the view that more can be done to speed up the progress of climate change. Firstly, countries will need to commit to active monitoring to track their progress. A quick visit to government websites reveals that many countries such as Hong Kong, Switzerland, New Zealand have taken steps to educate their citizens about environmental concerns. They have also set aside funds that either encourage companies to go green or take up green projects that are beneficial to the environment in the long run. A clear standard will need to be set and observed by all countries to minimize false or inaccurate reporting of carbon emissions. Instead of waiting for governments to put regulations in place, private companies should act swiftly to conduct studies that help improve efficiency and reduce wastage. Finally, governments should work towards creating new jobs so as to minimize job losses and disruptions.\nIn conclusion, the message to everyone has never been clearer. We cannot achieve lofty climate change goals alone. We need to take ownership of the problems that we have created, perhaps due to excessive consumption, and assume full responsibility. While I observe that that has not happened presently, I refuse to accept that all our attempts to revert global warming are destined to fail. As shown by the success of the Montreal Protocol, it is clearly possible that as a race, we are perfectly capable of directing our futures and changing our fortunes. While some tacky challenges remained, I adopt the sanguine view that in time, some of our attempts will succeed. A successful attempt can inspire future generations and pave the way for future successes. My only hope is that success comes soon enough before we cross the line of no return and it is too late."

                "prompt": "Individuals achieve sporting success, not nations. Discuss.",
                "text": "Sporting successes are accomplishments that are highly sought after by nations. When athletes earn medals in sporting competitions, entire nations celebrate. This is because sports people who represent their countries to compete send a strong message to the rest of the world. They represent their country's virtues, values, and pride. Therefore, an athlete's sporting success is synonymous with a country's success. When sporting successes are achieved, it is usually not the effort of one person. A myriad of parties are typically involved. It is perhaps too myopic to simply assign credit to individuals and forget about the nations. There is compelling evidence to indicate that nations play significant roles too.\nTo be sure, achieving sporting success is by no means an easy feat. One's talent would need to be recognized at an early age in order for development to start as soon as possible. The nurturing of a champion is a long and arduous process and typically take years before any form of success is achieved. Committed sports people who strive to be competitive often have to seek out opportunities to train overseas in order to become the best. Such endeavours require resources – resources that one may or may not have. Soccer is the most popular sport in Brazil and children take to the streets daily to play their favourite game. Given a culture that is fanatic about soccer and a population of over 200 million, we can safely assume that there are abundant soccer talents in the country. Some of the most prominent sports personalities such as Ronaldo, Pele and Ronaldinho have emerged from Brazil. However, these superstars are extremely rare. Brazil, a country mired in debt, continues to struggle with poverty. It is therefore understandable that the country may not have the required resources to develop all of its best talents. It is a cruel fact of life that most children playing on the streets of Brazil will never make it to become a professional soccer player. Children from countries such as Argentina and Mexico with a similar profile experience a similar fate. Even so, we cannot ignore the fact that some individuals to rise to become superstars in the sports industry. Without the support of the nation, how is that possible?\nI believe luck plays a part. Many of these young players are scouted by professional scouts at a very young age. Professional soccer clubs, having a vested interest in the sport, are always on the lookout for young talents. They know and understand that these young talents are hungry for success. In such cases, individuals and private entities contribute the greatest to one's accomplishments. Admittedly, the culture of a nation determines the level of support that sports personalities are likely to gain. However, support may still be lacking in areas of finance and infrastructure.\nIndividuals play a massive role in sporting success. Sports people are known to be determined and resilient. They do not give up easily even in the face of severe adversity. When the nation is not supportive, sports people can try to fund their own pursuits with savings or seek out sponsors. Joseph Schooling, an Olympic gold medalist from Singapore, went to the United States to train with the best. In an interview, his parents confessed that they had easily spent over a million dollars of their own money to support Joseph's training. Likewise, Soh Rui Yong, a marathoner who is a SEA games gold medalist also trained in the United States and had to support himself while training and studying at the same time. Yong Yi Xiang, a young martial artist in Singapore, trained with the national team in China under austere conditions. Some leave their families behind while others defer their studies to train. Such 'sacrifices' set an exemplary example for aspiring sports people and the message is clear – pursue your dreams if you believe in them.\nWhile individuals can make a great impact on their own careers, they may meet formidable obstacles without any form of external support. Talent is meaningless without having opportunities for such talents to develop and blossom. Nations as well as private institutions that recognize sports talents do provide the resources and infrastructure to ensure a country's dominance in certain sports. A salient example would be China selecting young children to join Wu Shu training from a very young age. Young children are selected based on their physical attributes and their potential to do well in the sport. Once chosen, the children go through intensive and vigorous training to become world class athletes. Jet Li, an international celebrity, was a beneficiary of this system. He won over a dozen gold medals in Wu Shu before retiring and becoming an action star. Similarly, in many European nations such as Brazil, Spain, Mexico and Argentina, young talented players go for auditions at local youth clubs. Those who are selected are offered contracts. If they do well, they will be offered more lucrative contracts and go on to become professional players. Having these systems in place ensure that talented players get a chance to join and excel in sports, which is beneficial to both individuals and nations.\nIt does sometimes appear that governments only play a minor role in sporting success but I disagree. In many developed nations, specialized sports institutions are set up to nurture the talents of those who are gifted in sports. In Singapore, the Singapore Sports School is well equipped with cutting edge knowledge and equipment to aid and support aspiring sports individuals to pursue their interests. The advantages that the Sports School offers are apparent and lead to tangible results. In fact, it has become a point of contention. Some parents wonder if it is rational to include the Sports School in national sports competitions since they have the tendency to win by large margins in almost all sports! Although contentious, the presence of the Singapore Sports School provides irrefutable evidence that governments play some part in sporting success. Governments are also known to offer attractive monetary incentives to athletes who win medals and enhance national pride.\nIn conclusion, I am of the opinion that we should not define 'nation' so narrowly as to only include the governments. A nation consists of all its people in its entirety – its leaders, the public and private institutions, as well as private citizens. With this broad definition, I am more inclined to believe both individuals and nations play major roles in achieving sporting success. The individual contributes by giving his or her full dedication and even go as far as to deplete personal savings. Private institutions can help to develop young talents by setting up youth clubs and providing coaching expertise since they have a vested interest in keeping the sports industry healthy. Governments can assist by investing in infrastructure (e.g. building stadiums) and provide financial support or incentives to encourage better performances. For these reasons, I am hesitant to conclude that individuals achieve sporting success and not nations. Both nations and individuals play considerable roles that contribute to sporting successes. Both should work closely together to achieve the best results. Individuals should show their full commitment and nations should back individuals with adequate resources and infrastructure. Both parties benefit. Individuals acquire personal success and fame. In doing so, as representatives of their nations, they also end up portraying their nations in a positive light."

Unfortunately, Nigeria is far from alone in being incapable or unwilling to sort out its own problems, at least not in a manner deemed satisfactory to the powers that be in the world. Such distrust has led to cries for world powers to intervene in any domestic issue that potentially could escalate in conflict, justifying America's role as the de-facto World Police. Still, there are others who believe that countries have the ability to sort out their own problems and manage the conflict within their territories, with their nuanced knowledge of the issue, and facilitated by a lack of resistance to the interventions, as typical of external help. Having considered both sides of the issue, I must admit I am more for non-intervention, believing that countries experiencing conflict should be generally left to sort out its own problems.\nAdmittedly, there is some merit to the argument that such countries facing conflict should not be abandoned to their own devices since the conflict is often, in large part, due to a lack of ability or resources. This is indeed a fair point when we consider that the conflict is a testament to the inability for the initial disagreement to be resolved. Whether it is due to a lack of resources to meet the needs of the nation, or less tangible forms of inability, it does appear that patient optimism would likely prove insufficient in resolving the problems. King Mswati III of Swaziland has been turning a blind eye to the abject poverty that most of its people struggle with on a daily basis, while indulging his fifteen wives in luxuries and comfort. The growing resentment in the community is gaining attention, even if the monarch is determined to ignore it. Sadly, Swaziland is far from being alone, with Aung San Suu Kyi's conspicuous silence on the Rohingyas deafening, to say the least. Whether the conflict is borne of a lack of resources or ability, the severity that fuelled the escalation can indeed be said to justify intervention of some sort. At least, at first glance, it seems we are morally obliged to not leave the troubled to their own limited devices.\nArmed with the perceived need for a foreign power with an arsenal of both resources and morality, we have embraced intervention, conveniently overlooking the vested interest of such measures. We have so often painted in our minds, images of countries in conflict as torn, broken souls incapable of survival, and the intervention as the arrival of justice and light to life the afflicted out of the miasma and darkness. Most of the time, we completely fail to consider the motivations of such assistance. In the rare occasion that we do, we defend it as fair reward for the supposed altruistic efforts. America's fervour in ensuring justice, somehow seeming to be confined to nations that have oil, is perhaps the clearest indication of such vested interest. Even if we dismiss this accusation, there are an abundance of other examples. Be it the generous assistance extended from Australia to Nauru, so as to solve its economic challenges, that has seen Nauru become the dumping ground for refugees turned away by Australia. Or the recent news of Filipino President Duterte rejecting millions and millions of financial aid offered by the United Nations for different problems and issues. All these cases reveal one undeniable truth: Assistance is rendered with vested interest. Even if it can mitigate issues in the short run, the implications, not to mention obligations, make the intervention or acceptance of it, rather imprudent.\nTo complicate matters, problems are not universal, couched in the unique context and mindset of its people. This hinders the effectiveness of intervention in other countries' problems. The reality is that we see the world from our own perspectives, so the assessment of the cause, and by extension the solution, is very much married to our perspectives. Our perspectives, again a product of our time, experiences, and social values. To then apply this lens to a society not our own is foolhardy at best. Without understanding the multitude of causes and the byzantine web of exacerbating factors, the simplistic imposition of a supposed panacea, with the naive arrogance accorded by privilege, will bring little of the reprieve we vainly seek. Our prideful ego, in seeking to bring advancement and improvement to perceived forgotten lands, can be found littered in the annals of history, thwarted by the savage, ungrateful creates unable to comprehend the gifts of modernity. From the futile attempts to educate women on menstrual hygiene, or merely seeking to eradicate the abhorrent practice of Chhaupadi – banishing women to secluded huts during their menstrual cycle – our efforts to solve problems and eliminate conflict are clearly thwarted by our lack of true understanding. Whether conflict stems from gender, cultural practices, race, religion, or whichever arbitrary division prevalent, intervention on the basis of wisdom, knowledge, or wealth, does little to resolve conflict, even if it might numb the extent somewhat.\nWhat perhaps is the straw that breaks the camel's back is the pride involved in conflict resolution. This is particularly troubling since one country's problem can be construed as injurious to the image of the nation. To then have another nation coming to the rescue is likely to be far more than any self-respecting citizen can bear. After all, nationalistic pride would prevent one from accepting the superiority of another nation and its ways, especially at the implied rejection of one's own, or at least the acknowledgement of its inadequacies. From Castro's rebellious declaration that Cuba does not need \"gifts from the Empire\", to North Korea's persistent efforts to credit the Supreme Leader for the items sent by America, the insecurity and threat to sovereignty is plainly evident. Even in the face of rational reason, the acceptance of assistance from other nations is an admission of weakness and ineptitude. Moreover, this is assuming that the help was not already mired in a Gordian knot of terms and conditions, intended to impose the values and will of the party offering help. The European Union's offer to bail out bankrupt nations often included a requirement for austerity measures, at once a clear show of dominance and also a less than covert criticism on existing leadership. Such efforts, rationally sensible, provoke resentment and retaliation, further fracturing the communities already having difficulties.\nWith such clear limitations to intervention, it is logical for nations to be given the space to work through their issues. They have the clearest insight and knowledge; and whether they admit and acknowledge it is another matter.  The solutions, however juvenile or imperfect the rest of the world deems, is theirs and they can focus on tweaking it instead of being compelled to fervently defend it out of pride. Perhaps most poignant is the revelation that problems and conflicts are largely products of perception. The value-judgement and priorities already vary enough from individual to individual, without foreign input to complicate matters far more.\nNow, it is not to say that foreign intervention has no place, but that the conditions must be thus urgent and severe enough to necessitate the actions, considering the implications and general futility. Thankfully, our pride does allow for the acceptance of help and intervention, at least when it is apparent that the refusal of which mean certain death and suffering in the immediate future. Typically triggered by natural catastrophes, the urgency and severity facilitate the expression and acceptance of humanity, without fear of the cynical self-interest that attaches itself to rational thought and plans. Wherever the catastrophe, the world rallies quickly, driven by the stark reminder of our own mortality, to help a fellow human being. We are cognisant that without assistance, irrevocable consequences are swift and cruel, spurring us to act as a collective bastion of humanity. Yet, in less urgent situations, we find ways to rationalise our way out of helping or accepting such help, however severe it may be.In all, it is clear that countries experiencing conflict should generally be left to sort out its own problems, with its expertise and the futility of intervention, though it must be acknowledged that we should make an exception in cases of extreme urgency and severity. Whether the decision to not intervene is borne of acknowledgement of futility or trust in the community, this approach will at least reduce complications and divergence that lend itself to further disagreements. It takes a lot of faith to allow events to unfold themselves, the effort to resist intervention far greater than simply taking over. Let us not make the mistake of equating non-intervention with disinterest, but instead, choose to see it as the greatest expression of faith and confidence in the fellow humans in other nations. As much as we lambast Nigeria and their president, we should remember that the people had the wisdom to not re-elect President Goodluck. That should count for something."

                "text": "The first female Thai Prime Minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, was ousted from power primarily on the argument that she would irrevocably compromise the future of the nation by taking on too much debt in the funding of her pet project – a high speed rail that connects parts of Thailand and even neighbouring countries. If indeed pulled off, this could have sparked tremendous economic development in the vast nation, currently segregated by chasms in wealth and opportunity. However, the Yellow Shirts faction argue that this project would instead hinder economic development, since the nation would be buried under crippling debt. Whichever side of the argument, what is apparent is the unanimous assumption that the nation's well-being is dependent on its economic development; what differs is the strategy to achieve said development. This, however, relies on a simplistic view of the term \"country's well-being\" as it opines that well-being is primarily material. Should we acknowledge that well-being of a nation necessarily comprises fewer tangible criteria, then it is clear that economic development often leads to well-being for a nation, but admittedly can hardly promise it.\nThe main reason why most would instinctively agree that economic development is fundamental to a nation's well-being is the fact that our capitalist world necessitates financial ability to provide the material needs for a nation. Beyond merely catering to immediate needs, economic development in the form of long-term strategy and policies, can go a long way in ensuring sustainability and continued self-sufficiency. In the case of Nauru, an island-nation once abundant with phosphate deposits, the lack of economic development beyond mere mining and sales, arguably led the nation to its woeful state today, reliant on handouts and goodwill of Australia, and accepting the refugees Australia places in their nation. The problem is that Nauru is far from alone, with Kiribati and Venezuela failing to meet the needs of their people, arguably also because of their lack of economic development. Hence, it is painfully apparent that in our capitalist world, economic development is often an important element in ensuring the welfare of the nation. Admittedly, some nations like Cuba and Bhutan, have gotten by without much emphasis on economic development, eschewing traditional goals like increased Gross Domestic Product, in favour of welfare and happiness. While the manifestations of their goals are different, Cuba through clear social structure, and Bhutan through the emphasis on happiness, they have in their own ways sought to improve the nation's well-being. It must be noted that while the main thrust of their efforts may not lie in the usual forms that economic development take, economic development still play a part, with Cuba becoming a more open economy and Bhutan opening itself up for tourism. They may not have been the most eager proponents of economic development as a means to ensure the well-being of the nation, they too incorporate it as part of the government's arsenal, hence proving a nation's well-being is dependent on economic development.\nAnother reason for this dependence is the fact that economic development is often taken as an indicator of a capable government, a trait that is needed for the nation to have a voice on international platforms. As the Chancellor of Germany, a nation with laudable economic health and system, it is little wonder that Angela Merkel is the second most powerful person in the world. This same quality has allowed Singapore, a tiny island-nation, to have a loud voice on international matters. Evidently, sound economic policies and sustained development are essential in the reputation of nations and their leaders. The same clout then enables the nation's welfare to be protected, without being subject to the generosity of those in power. Greece's financial crisis rendered them vulnerable and at the mercy of Germany. While Greece sought a bailout, they were compelled to undergo the crippling experience of a complete breakdown of the system and entertain the possibility of austerity measures as condition for future assistance from its wealthier European counterparts. This makes it abundantly clear that economic development is needed to ensure a nation's well-being.\nThat said, there is something absolutely noble about turning one's back on economic matters and focussing on the intangibles instead. Beyond mere economic pursuit, once that has been achieved, the nation's well-being would divorce from the material pursuits. This is when the Nordic countries seem to shine the way. Not known for rapid economic development nor productivity in the way that Asia has set the bar, countries like Norway, Finland, and Denmark illuminate the way forward for national welfare. Finland has on of the best education systems in the world, a trait that would have been exploited by innumerable other nations to boost economic growth, yet Finland channels its best people into education for long-term betterment. Not materially, but intangibly. Norway's expenditure on criminals, even recalcitrant ones like Anders Breivik, could have gone a long way in boosting productivity or development, but Norway believes in being human and humane. These examples show that while a nation's well-being is typically dependent on economic development, it may not be so for nations which have attained enough to meet its needs. For these privileged nations, their well-being then veers away from the pursuit of economic development, on to other areas that are often intangible, and with it, something to be truly proud of.\nAll in all, it is apparent that a nation's well-being is largely dependent on economic development, whether past or present. The issue is not then the mandate to push for even more economic development, but to realise it is just a means to the end. True well-being is the freedom for governments to do what is best of the nation and people, without needing to fear that they will be ousted for it."

                "text": "As the horror of the Brexit poll hit the people, as they scrambled to make sense of what their collective stupor and ignorance had caused, the data-crunchers found a scapegoat on which to pin the responsibility. It turns out that the older voters had favoured the \"Leave\" campaign over the more rational \"Remain\" one. Vehement protests and moral outrage took over as the people shifted their regret into anger that the old had supposedly sabotaged the future in which they would not have to live to see. Many began to lament that the old, more than any other time, have no place in society, citing their entrenched mindsets, the rampant ageism, and their inability to keep up with the rapidly-changing world. The more rational, however, point out that the old today have more place than before, with the larger numbers of the old cementing their place in society as demographic composition changes, with ever more efforts in place to facilitate the old in attaining their needs, not to mention the commitment to their quality of life. Having considered both sides of the issue, even at the risk of sounding idealistic, I have to admit that I am of the opinion that the old in society today can hardly be said to have no place in society, when compared to any other time.\nThe pessimistic would argue that the old today are obsolete in modern cosmopolitan societies, unlike in the past when their entrenched mindsets were in sync with the more homogenous societies of yesteryears. Many societies today are diverse and cosmopolitan, often embracing a breath of views hitherto unprecedented. The implication is that individuals may too easily feel out of place in society, with the older individuals plausibly having difficulty feeling at home in a society that has evolved at a pace that far outstrips their ability and willingness to let go of the familiar. It is then a hop and a skip away from concluding that the old must then have no place in this dynamic world. The popularity of the \"I don't want to live on this planet anymore\" meme featuring Professor Farnsworth of Futurama aptly reveals the perception of the elderly mentality, suggesting that the old must feel utter disgust and disappointment in the world today. It is evident there is widespread discomfort in the current state of affairs, with the old seeking escape from the world they no longer recognise. While amusing and humourous, even possibly true in some cases, this argument grossly overlooks the flawed assumptions that render the conclusion invalid. It may be difficult to admit, but this widely held belief regarding the old is, in fact, born and perpetuated by the younger generation eager to dismiss the abilities of the old, whether out of pride or ignorance. In particular, the older generation's staunch defence to preserve values and practices may be far too easily dismissed as a product of entrenched mindsets, thus alleviating the possibly equally stubborn younger generation's need to give due consideration to the words of the old. One such example could be the distorted feminism that is prevalent. Female empowerment and rights are indubitably evidence of progress, though the more extreme efforts, such as the Slut Walks, in which women often demonstrated their freedom through the abandonment of clothing to embrace varying degrees of nudity may bring concern. Likewise, the efforts of the sexual minorities to gain acceptance have often turned to provocative means. Such perverse goals and unorthodox means are understandably likely to be met with disdain of the older people in society, who may feel some discomfort at the ways of the youth today. The stereotype of the old as concerned though out-of-touch with modernity, manifesting their good intentions in the form of nostalgic laments, unsolicited advice, and even condemnations of shame, quickly come to mind. However, rather than misconstrue these phenomena as evident that they have no place, we should recognise it as precisely the very reason why the old have a place. As much as their natterings may seem unimportant, the old in fact play the crucial role as the last bulwark that slows the rapid changes across domains that are simultaneously gnawing away at the foundations that underpin society. True that the words of the old, so steeped in the past, may not garner the same media attention that the latest social movement can, but even as the young struggle to break free from the reins, they need the old there to hold the reins and prevent them from a path more tangential and problematic than they had hoped for.\nStill, the most cynical would insist on the old having lost their place, choosing to see the old as burdens and helpless victims of ageism in the societies that are now cognisant of the realities when faced with unprecedented numbers of the previously-celebrated rare few survivors into old age. They point to the undercurrents latent in many developed societies between the young and old, suggesting that the younger have grown tired of the old, exhausted under the weight of supporting the many older people, who seem utterly incapable of being self-sufficient and fighting the discrimination they incessantly lament about. As an illustration, these cynics point to both the disgruntled comments of the young and the old, with the occasional incident on the news as irrevocable evidence of such sentiment. Despite some existence of the impatience and frustration that rears its ugly head every once in a while, the fatalistic notion of consequent irrelevance as inevitable overlooks the need for adjustment to changing demographic shifts, which although uncomfortable, is rather temporary. As much as there are a number of societies still negotiating the changes, there are many that have successfully adjusted its mindsets and policies to support the needs of the growing silver generation in their population. From atop the list of ageing populations, Japan has successfully found a place in its heart and well-oiled economy to accommodate the elderly, who take on meaningful tasks with the traditional skills few youths have, and who contribute to the community in ways considered less effortful and more suited to the realities of old age. In other ageing societies, the old are far from just useless burdens, cast aside and preserved in the name of ethical duty. It is evident that besides the initial adjustment and irreverent few voices that cast doubt, the old have a place in society.\nAdmittedly, some sympathetic individuals have expressed pity and concern for the old who they perceive to have no place today, considering the degree of technological advancement that drives our world today. There is fear that the rapid progress and seemingly ever-changing processes are far too much for the old who would supposedly feel out of place and obsolete, in a way that the old from other times would plausibly not. Putting aside the fact that this conjecture is a construct of imagination and laced with some well-intentioned stereotypes, this view, in its zeal for compassion, under-estimated the ability of the old to learn and overlooked the abundance of resources now available to quench the insatiable thirst for knowledge and self-improvement, both of which are unaffected by age. As much as age has been a convenient excuse to justify a lack of interest, effort, and success, especially when it comes to learning, this argument fails to hold water when we consider the sheer amount of options now available to facilitate the learning of the older generation. The subsequent silver invasion into domains once solely dominated by the young, such as social media platforms, reveal the undeniable truth that when the old desire it, they have a wealth of resources to enable them to get it. Today, they reign over social media platforms that the young hurriedly left behind, finding more ways to make use of the platforms, be it livestreams of garage sales or sharing of the latest health tips. The elderly are able to, and have embraced technology, thus cannot be considered obsolete, especially when we realise that the efforts to help the old and resources provided are, in fact, clear indications of the continued relevance of the old.\nIn the face of the arguments on empowerment and resources, the most staunch would still insist that the frailty of old age means less place for the old in society. This is arguably exacerbated by the limits that have been pushed in terms of medically-preserved decrepitude. As individuals age, it seems logical to no longer retain the physical prowess associated with youth in their peak physical states. Medical issues seem to creep up and ageing bodies try to negotiate the issues to compensate for, and carry on, some semblance of life. The feared fall of an elderly, the dreaded hip replacement or knee replacement, are some physical issues faced. The intangible senile dementia and other conditions add to the fray, with the old already embroiled in this private struggle. Thankfully, the concerns surrounding health in old age have been largely mitigated by the powerful strides in technology that has the ability to negate the ravages of time. Physiology has been thoroughly studied and many treatments and interventions developed. From the media's hype over ordinary women who defy time by looking like they are their children's ages, we can see that the old have access to and employed techniques to overcome these physical limitations. Even for the mind, there are many pharmaceutical interventions, such as to delay and even reverse brain ageing. Clearly, technology can, or at least soon, ensure the old still have a place in society. I do concede that such tools and benefits may not be available to all the elderly in every society. The availability of the resources and efforts are still predicated on one's wealth and thus not readily accessible to everyone. Still, the circumstance that the old find themselves in is not without reprieve. As we look beyond today, we need to help the old and those without resources to be able to seek the help they need.\nAll in all, our cynicism, fears, and criticisms, may tempt us into downplaying the place for the old, but we need to keep a rational mind to focus on the place they have. With the world staring down a silver tsunami, it is best we make pace with any existing issues to help our society, young and old through the next set of challenges. A convenient scapegoat the old may be, it is still unwise to give them up as sacrifice whenever any polarising poll comes around. Before blaming \"Brexit\" on the old, it would make more sense to listen to the views in an objective manner and understand the issues, rather than take the easy way out by blaming the old."

                "text": "Only one female made it into the top hundred list of highest earners in the sports industry. Serena Williams, the last woman standing, is ranked a mere fifty-first in the 2017 list, according to Forbes. This has led to outrage and disappointment among the feminists, who consider this a scandal and reason for their renewed vigour. The more realistic are aware that the pursuit of equality between the sexes is utterly futile, being fraught with challenges, and the cynics among them would be quick to argue that the endeavour is clearly foolish if clear results are not attainable. The more idealistic would choose to focus on the principle and value of the endeavour, believing that it is a sensible choice. Having considered both sides of the issue, I harbour no unrealistic notion about the efficacy and acknowledge the futility of the effort, but I must admit I see value in the pursuit nonetheless, with the ensuring debate, empowerment, and hope for our humanity in the long run.\nI must concede that there is truth in the viewpoint that the endeavour is futile, being fraught with nuances and complexities that led some to believe the entire pursuit as being foolish. It is true that the concept of equality is already challenging to grasp, much less apply to the sensitive topic of differences between and within the sexes. Equality, being about ensuring similar access to opportunity, is already challenging to understand, being so often misunderstood as equitable outcomes. The problem is further complicated with inherent differences between the sexes that render any pursuit of equality rather pointless, with many misconstruing the fundamental notions and consequent inability to arrive at a common consensus. The pessimists would then point to the innumerable efforts on the part of feminist and activists in pursuit of equality and feel buoyed by the evident lack of success, not to mention vast amounts of time, effort, and other resources that have been poured into the pursuit, all in vain. The Slut Parade, International Women's Day, and even #Women2Drive would perhaps be at the top of their minds as they shake their heads at the foolish squandering of resources, believing that the pursuit is foolish since it would be for naught. I must disagree on it being foolish. I choose to focus on the discussion that ensued, though rather inconclusive, and at times, even controversial, the discussion is still very much of value. The fervent and often heated debate actually serves much importance to the growing maturity of the society, as the populace considers different views on the respective sexes and reflects on what equality means for themselves and others. The emotional debate over victim-shaming in rape cases and the extent of rights that each individual has over himself or herself is an invaluable discussion, even if little consensus is achieved in the end. Hence, as much as I agree that the pursuit of equality between the sexes is not likely to bring results, I do not think it is foolish when we consider the resultant discussion.\nOn top of the discussion that the pursuit brings, it is imperative that we consider the resultant empowerment of the vulnerable that renders this admittedly futile pursuit not so foolish after all. Pursuing gender equality may well be doomed due to ingrained mindsets, but the overt emphasis on the situation at least ameliorates the situation of the less powerful gender. Take for instance, the oft-cited plight of Saudi Arabian women, who are deemed to be victims of one of the most unequal societies in the world. The females in the society are not even adequately empowered to be allowed into a common space with the males of the society, not to mention have a bank account without the blessings of their husbands, or be eligible to earn their driving licenses. With the admittedly pointless pursuit of gender equality, what it at least does is to highlight the plight of the gender most disenfranchised, so that some improvement and attention is at least possible for those who are incapable of helping themselves. The concessions in allowing the women in Saudi Arabia to finally get their driving license without providing means for independent travel and even vote, albeit in a most undemocratic society, at least serves to alleviate the grievous sense of injustice somewhat, despite clearly not being meaningful representation or even indication of true equality. The same can be said for the women in Afghanistan and Yemen, or even the men in Singapore. Hence, while I do acknowledge the endeavour as futile, I simply do not consider it foolish.\nStill, the staunchly pragmatic would dismiss the pursuit as foolish, with the futility, or at best insignificant benefits. They argue that the social upheaval and polarising debate are far too much a cost to bear, in the light of the inconsequential outcomes. They would point to the sharply divisive controversies that have threatened to tear the already fraying social fabric in most societies already under pressure from global forces. As it is, traditions and norms are already under siege from the diversity brought about by the unprecedented mobility and diasporas that have spread far and wide. In this situation, the pursuit of gender equality may well be the proverbial straw that breaks the camel's back, as it could well be what stretches the fibres that are barely holding society together. The outcry over the treatment of Indian women, especially the Dalit women, has been made the scapegoat for the division and lack of progress in the Indian society. Yet, such a fatalistic and pessimistic view overlooks the possibility of some progress and maturity in the society, albeit in the long run. The risk-averse approach focusses too much on the short-run threat, without giving due consideration to the possible progress that can be gained in the long run. This is not to say that the endeavour would be eventually successful or to even bear some fruit in gender equality. Instead, it is entirely likely that we would be condemned to the perpetual over-compensation that the pursuit of gender equality serves to constantly result in. Rather, what makes the endeavour meaningful, and not foolish as claimed by the pessimists, is the development of the maturity of the populace and, dare I suggest, the advancement of society and civilisation. As much as we have yet to have any true equality of the sexes, we can infer the potential of such pursuits of equality between criminals and non-criminals. The enlightened approach seen in the Nordic countries had been sparked by the humanitarian emphasis on equality. Norway's revolutionary, world's-first commitment to equality, seen in the Halden Prison and the Bastoy Island Prison, had its genesis in the pursuit of equality at the realisation of the cruel ways previously employed on juvenile delinquents in the Boys' Home on Bastoy Island itself. The contemporary island retreat of a prison is testament to the progress such pursuits can bring. While true that these Scandinavian countries are, for now, rather lonely in such enlightenment, what is undeniable is the prerequisite of the pursuit for equality in the long-term progress of the society. Hence, as much as the pursuit of equality between the sexes is unlikely to bear fruit, given that it is perhaps one of the only inequalities backed by actual differences in biology, the pursuit itself is hardly foolish as it is a necessary first step in societal progress.\nOn a more practical note, the admittedly futile effort is still not foolish when we consider the actual need for change in gender roles and responsibilities brought about by the changing circumstances, which the pursuit would facilitate. The world today is changing rapidly in terms of technological advancement, altering the situation in societies, cost of living, and also work demands. Along with these, society's expectations with respect to gender roles, procreation, and family, have also shifted. Some more significantly than other perhaps, but nonetheless, changed and are still changing. As a result, the entrenched gender inequality would prove to be a hurdle for the required changes to keep up with changing societal needs. Hence, even when the pursuit of gender inequality would likely fail to bring about true equality in terms of access to opportunities, it is a worthwhile endeavour as it crucially paves the way for much needed changes that facilitate society's adapting to the changing circumstances in order to survive, much less thrive. This can be seen in the Finnish society, which is often held up as a guiding light for equality, where females are given concessions and support so that motherhood would not unfairly penalise them. Putting aside the controversial argument that this is equality in practice, when so clearly the men do not have access to similar concessions, what is evident is that the society has benefitted from the pursuit of equality, in that the effort has been leveraged upon to make much-needed changes to the landscape of work and socio-exploitation of human resources to ensure Finland's continued survival in the modern world. The same can be said of the Chinese in mainland China, which in the name of gender equality, has made being a leftover woman a badge of honour to harness the previously unexploited potential of the female population. In South Sudan, the practice of abusing fattening pills to achieve the societal standard of feminine beauty, at the expense of health, is now criticised, again under the banner of gender equality, to ensure the populace moves away from such wastage of resources and onto the empowerment that would help improve the pitiable plight of the impoverished nation saddled by traditional notions steeped in gender subjugation. Evidently, as much as the pursuit is indeed futile, the potential of the endeavour as a means to ensure society is able to keep up with changing circumstances makes it far from foolish.\nIn all, the pursuit of gender equality is likely to be futile, given the complexities and subjectivity of the notion, not to mention the entrenched mindsets that hinder any effort. Still, it is far from foolish considering the consequent debate, empowerment, and its potential as a tool for progress and advancement. As much as it is a thorny topic and a source of frustration for many, we must resist the temptation to surrender the pursuit using the simplistic assertion that futility equates folly. Instead, we should recognise the excuse for what it is and look beyond its immediate futility to recognise its central role in our growth, be it personal or societal. Perhaps another way of looking at it is to realise that it is more foolish to succumb and accept limitations as told, for if Serena Williams did, she would not have made it to the top hundred list, nor become the inspiration for so many in the world."

Who knew that this very ‘global city’, which houses a global trade and finance centre, was a once upon a time one of many port towns in the world surrounded by slumps and villages. This is nothing short of startling. More astonishingly, Singapore became a success despite being a small and open island nation-state without the endowment of natural resources. What is being described here as the success of ‘The Singapore Story’ will forever be written in the annals of world history. Nevertheless, one might question the utility of a sense of history when approaching Singapore’s future, given that the circumstances described in the annals were very much different from those in the present. Borrowing the words of Singapore’s economic architect Dr. Goh Keng Swee: will living in the ghost of history help Singapore “as a base from which to scale new heights”? This essay seeks to explore the utility of a sense of history when approaching Singapore’s geo-political and socio-cultural challenges in a period of transition.\nThe historical situations which shaped the building of modern Singapore were a very tumultuous one – British colonisation, Japanese occupation during World War II, joining the Malaysian Federation in 1963, and Independence in 1965. These events, which shaped the mettle and iron in her founding fathers to rule, such as the late Mr. Lee Kuan Yew and Dr. Goh Keng Swee, would almost never occur again, not at least in the same form. At the same time, the world was a very different place then. Globalisation had not become so widespread a phenomenon, and the world was polarised in a ‘Cold War’ between the US and the USSR over political ideologies and economic practices. The two very different climates of past and present makes it easy for one to undervalue the utility of a sense of history to guide our future development, especially when Singapore we see today was built in the climate of the past.\nHowever, study and deeper observation of Singapore’s history allows to understand the tenets on which the republic was founded upon, and continue to flourish on.\nOnce a part of the Federation of Malaysia formed in 1963, separation came on 9th August 1965 over irresoluble differences of governance. Founding Malaysian Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman led a ‘Malay Malaysia’ founded upon on the supremacy of the ethnic Malay majority and their rights; while the leaders of Singapore’s self-governing People’s Action Party (PAP) campaigned for a ‘Malaysian Malaysia’  based on multiracial meritocracy. Having an ethnic-Chinese majority is not something helpful, or even sometimes welcomed. This is especially when Singapore’s immediate neighbours such as Malaysia and Indonesia are demographically distinct, and base themselves on fundamentally different political principles.\nSingapore’s subsequent economic success and contributing socio-political stability compared to her neighbours is itself an imbedded criticism of their systems. The fundamental differences in ‘organising principles’ will forever shape the dynamism of her relations with Malaysia and Indonesia, especially when bilateral contentions are present. For instance, the issues of sovereignty over the supply of water and land reclamation with Malaysia, and Indonesia’s recent naming of two warships after marines who have set off bombs in Singapore during her state-launched policy of Confrontation. Without a sense of history and understanding of these intricacies, these real external threats will not be identified and dealt with ‘prudently’ where other contentions may possibly arise. As Machiavelli teaches in The Prince, when “the malady has become incurable” there is “no longer remedy.” Future generations of Singaporeans will suffer if they fail to have a sense of these ‘historical baggages’, let alone foresee and resolve the issues when they arise at infancy. Hence, a sense of history sheds Singapore wisdom in her future dealings with realpolitik in international relations.\nSimultaneously, having a sense of history allows citizens to form a sense of identity and belonging. The social stability in modern Singapore’s social stability did not come without challenges. During the 1950 to the mid-1960s, post-war Singapore underwent a dark age of civil unrest, most of which occurred on racial lines. While still part of Malaysia, the 1964 Racial riots left 36 dead and 556 injured when violence between ethnic Chinese and Malays groups. The conflict was spurred by members of the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO), the dominant political party in peninsula Malaysia, inciting Malays in Singapore to violently press for their ‘Special Rights.’ At that time, the local PAP government campaigned for a “Malaysian Malaysia” in the Malayan Solidarity Convention with other Malaysian opposition parties. The dark ages were formative on Singapore’s practice of “the principles of liberty and justice and ever seeking the welfare and happiness of her people in a more just and equal society” upon independence. These were the very words declared by Mr. Lee Kuan Yew in the Proclamation of Singapore. The rights of minority groups such as the Malays and Indians were ensured by the government, and these minorities were accorded political representation in parliament under the Group Representation Constituency electoral system. Housing and education policies were made such that the races intermingled and embraced diversity, and this has helped weave Singapore’s social fabric. A sense of history hence gives us the ability to better understand and reaffirm the ideals Singapore are built upon, and how we can continue to embrace diversity and not the ‘universality’ that certain peoples deem as more ‘right’ than other competing ‘rights.’\nThis understanding is even more important nowadays, especially when considering how globalisation brings about more intense and rapid social and cultural exchanges. A look back into our past can bring an awakening in the citizenry as to how we can stem incidents such as the unprecedented Little India Riots in 2014, which were sparked by migrant workers over xenophobic concerns. This is on a global backdrop of increased labour flows and migration. A sense of history hence helps Singapore to build upon the ‘Singapore Identity’, strengthening her multicultural and inter-religious roots. The mutual respect for other will be a helpful implement as the world continues its transit into late-modernity. As the Chinese proverb goes “When you drink water, remember the source.” Singaporeans should not forget how racial, religious and even ethnic harmony, not tolerance, has made it possible for them to prosper economically vis-a-vis good governance and pragmatic policies. This has allowed Singapore to remain relevant to the world despite being a small nation-state.\nHistory might never repeat itself, not at least in the same form. However, the process of societal development and nation building, and the conditions which shaped these processes, should not be forgotten in the least. The greatest utility a sense of history gives is in teaching Singapore and her citizenry important lessons about human nature, society and the real world. Among the team of Singapore’s founding fathers was Mr. S. Rajaratnam. He famously proclaimed in a speech that independent Singapore was “like a nun that had wandered by accident into a red-light district.” This was a harsh, yet truthful, description of our situation in Southeast Asia, a harsh geopolitical environment which has also been a traditional battleground for great and emerging powers. To continue to remain relevant to the world and thrive in a world of globalisation, Singaporeans should never forget our historical roots. They remind us that success is an act of human endeavor and should be maintained by so, not a godsend, especially to a small nation state.\n"

                "text": "‘Global’ is a pervasive term today - from the ongoing  ‘global war on terror’ coined by George W. Bush to ‘global cities’ to describe important node cities in the worldwide financial system like New York and Singapore. The widespread usage of this term derives from the ongoing process we term globalisation: an intricate web of processes which has made the world increasingly interconnected in worldwide technological, political, social, economic, and cultural exchanges and interdependencies. However, it remains to be seen whether this process has caused, or conversely prevented, more conflict. This essay will explore this key question based on the effects of globalisation in the political, socio-cultural and economic spheres of human endeavor.\nAnthony Giddens identifies the concept of ‘Time-Space separation’ to elucidate modernity’s dynamic nature in his Consequences of Modernity. While mankind’s concept of ‘time’ has been made homogeneous through a worldwide standardization of calendars and international time, our physical, geographical ‘places’ have been conversely separated from our social ‘spaces.’  This phenomena is largely attributed to the rise of information and communications technologies, most ostensibly the Internet. With the advent of social media and social networking sites, social influences from afar are given a platform to penetrate and subsequently shape our immediate surroundings. This often results in extensive political repercussions.\nIn 2011, a combination of influence of western ideas of liberalism from abroad and the use of social networking sites to circumvent state-operated media channels aided activists to orchestrate the Arab Spring against the incumbent Middle East governments. Mass protests and armed civil resistance came about from that combinnation. That aside, greater interconnectedness from the blurring of locale and global lines has potentially curtailed authoritarian, inhumane, and corrupted regimes from inflicting greater harm on their people. Western supporters of liberal ideals strongly purported these views at the time of insurrection.\nHowever, the proliferation of de-territorialising technologies can also be a double-edged sword. Fast-forward four years from the Arab Spring, the ‘global war on terror’ faces a new, globalised, threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), more commonly known as ISIS, Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Capitalising on technological advances and operating on social media platforms, ISIS is an extremist Muslim terrorist organisation which willingly shares information – or creates and manufactures “information”, or disinformation – to coax a global audience to join their cause. These platforms are also used to broadcast their acts of violence worldwide as a show of might, such as the infamous beheading of a Japanese journalist. In fact, ISIS propaganda has radicalised many moderate Muslims and disenfranchised youths in surrounding nations. It is hence evident that greater interconnectedness has, in fact, promulgated conflict beyond Iraqi and Syrian borders. The shifting sands in the Middle East create an impact on other regions too. In Southeast Asia, Malaysians, Indonesians and even a few Singaporeans have been inspired to join ISIS’ fight. The situation has created much domestic friction and polarisation, and is a good example of how globalisation has facilitated the spread of conflict.\nAs I have argued, globalisation is deeply characterized by the omnipresent media and lines of communications. Different cultures and ideas interact and exchange over these platforms, and the local lines are increasingly blurred. This has not only created awareness of other cultures worldwide, but also, fostered understanding. From July 2012, South Korean musical artist PSY gained international fandom as his music video Gangnam Style went viral over Youtube. Even international sensations like Katy Perry, Britney Spears and Tom Cruise amongst millions of others took to Twitter to share their appreciation of the music video. The video was known not only for its humour, but a strong satirical message on the pursuit of the outward appearance of wealth and luxury. This seemed to have created resonance across the globe. Commenting on this, UN Secretary General Ban Ki Moon remarks that “in this era of instability and intolerance we need to promote better understanding through the power of music.\" This demonstrates that cultural exchanges, be it through music or other mediums, can be a constructive force to promote collaboration, inter-cultural understanding, and – in an ideal situation – world peace.\nHowever, many critics see that the same cultural aspect of globalisation promotes the ‘cultural imperialism’ of western ideals. This means a greater and more dominant powers (nations) privileging and imposing their ideals over others. When a minority of Hong Kongers took to the streets in the Occupy Central movement over cries of ‘universal suffrage’, U.S. President Barack Obama pronounced that the U.S. would continue to  speak up for the “right of people” to both protest against and change the elections process determining Hong Kong’s Chief Executive. More ironically, Hong Kong’s ex-British governor and other British parliamentarians mention ‘democracy’ in Hong Kong despite her citizens being deprived of any democratic electoral processes under British administration. All this is despite Hong Kong having agreed to the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ constitution, which grants them not a full, but an altered, form of democracy given her historical circumstances. The aforementioned actions by western leaders have galvanized the protestor’s activism against the Chinese government in Beijing, resulting in a massive economic shutdown and violent clashes. This proves to show that cultural globalisation does have aspects which promote conflict, especially when people feel that their ideals are universal and can be replicated elsewhere. This seems to be too true, especially in relation to the earlier mentioned Arab Spring, which has later metamorphosed into an ‘Arab Winter’ of social and ethnic conflicts.\nGlobalisation and greater interconnectedness also bring economic aspects of free-market capitalism and industrialisation around the world. This has facilitated greater free-trade, increased capital flows, increased transport and communication, and the growth of multi-national companies (MNCs). One example of how these have brought more stability, less conflict, to a country once ravaged by the ills of war is South Korea. Under the leadership of third President Park Chung Hee, South Korea shifted her focus from self-sufficiency in the Syngman Rhee’s administration to export-oriented industrialisation. This facilitated the rise of multinational conglomerates such as Hyundai in heavy industries and motors, and Samsung in electronics and shipbuilding. To facilitate the above operations, infrastructures and communications were improved. As a result, a once socially instable and poverty-ridden post-war South Korea transformed into a wealthy, developed and socially stable nation in a span of four decades. The ‘Miracle on the Han River’ is a testament that globalisation and greater interconnectedness have allowed nations to experience less evils, hence conflict, compared to what would have been in the past.\nOn the contrary, the same economic aspects have ironically brought scourge to other parts of the world. There was an initial belief that Congo, which holds more than 80% of the world’s coltan reserves, would benefit socio-economically from the rise in demand of consumer electronics starting from the late 1990s. This is because coltan is a raw material used to produce tantalum in capacitors, a critical component in manufacturing computers and smart devices.  However, the digital revolution proved to be more of a bane than a boon. Warring rebel forces attack villages and displace families to mine and supply coltan in response to demand from MNCs. This finances their ensuing civil war. Even neighbouring Rwanda has joined in the pillaging to exploit the coltan reserves. As a consequence, more than a few million civilians have perished. This shows that when nations have weak governance and polarized societies, there are rendered unfit to best take advantage of too widespread a phenomena as globalization. In these cases, civil unrest, and conflict results.\nUltimately, our transition into an age of ‘late-modernity’ has been indubitable a multi-faceted and complex process. Globalisation and interconnectedness will likely remain an irreversible trend, but gloablisation can simultaneously bring more and less conflict. This largely depends on political, cultural, and historical climates of the geographical ‘places’ in which the related events occur. However, what remains important is that humanity continues to learn from her circumstances, and face them to construct a better age. This is through both the conflicts which globalisation has promoted in certain places such as the Middle East, Hong Kong and Congo; and the good it has done to other nations like South Korea."
